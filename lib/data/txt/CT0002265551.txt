### Background

The 30-acre Scovill Industrial Landfill site is located in Waterbury, Connecticut. The Scovill Manufacturing Company used this area as a landfill from 1919 to the mid-1970s for disposal of ash, cinders, demolition debris and other wastes generated by the company. The southern, 23-acre part of the site has been developed into residential and commercial properties. The northern part of the site is an undeveloped 6.8-acre parcel, referred to as the Calabrese parcel. This parcel was in the initial stages of development for a senior housing complex when industrial wastes were encountered during soil excavations for the concrete footings. The construction project was ordered to stop until the extent and degree of contamination was identified. In 1998 the CT Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) conducted a short-term action to protect human health and the environment by removing 2,300 tons of PCB-contaminated soil and 18 capacitors from the Calabrese parcel. EPA selected the site’s long-term remedy in September 2013 and completed the Remedial Design in September 2016.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

In 1998 CT DEEP conducted a short-term action to protect human health and the environment by removing 2,300 tons of PCB-contaminated soil and 18 capacitors from the Calabrese Parcel. CT DEEP covered the excavation area with a temporary soil cap and fenced it to keep trespassers out. The remaining developed part of the site is covered with buildings, pavement, and vegetation that provides a current barrier to contaminated soil. In January 2015, a vapor intrusion system was installed underneath one of the on-site buildings as a preventative measure to control soil gas from migrating into the building.

EPA selected the site’s [long-term remedy in September 2013](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0102953&doc=Y&colid=33047&region=01&type=SC). Design of the site’s remedy was completed in September 2016.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Construction of the remedy (i.e. excavation with consolidation and some off-site disposal, capping, and wetland restoration) began in spring of 2024 with a target completion date of 2027. The Remedial Design was completed in September 2016 and additional data collection to support the Remedial Action was conducted in 2023. The site’s long-term remedy includes construction of a protective cap at the Calabrese parcel with nearby wetland restoration, limited targeted removal of contaminated soils throughout various areas of the developed parcel to be placed under the cap, and other soil areas exceeding leachability criteria to be disposed of off-site to prevent contaminants permeating back into the groundwater. Environmental land use restrictions will be implemented across the entire site and performance of Five-Year Reviews will be conducted to assure continued protection of human health and the environment.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1998, the CTDEEP removed 2,300 tons of contaminated soil and 18 capacitors from the Calabrese Parcel.
