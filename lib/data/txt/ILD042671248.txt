### Background

The Indian Refinery – Texaco Lawrenceville site is a 990-acre former petroleum refinery located south of Lawrenceville in Lawrence County, Illinois. Various owners operated the refinery from the early 1990s until 1995. Immediately prior to 2011, American Western Refining, L.P. (AWR) and its subsidiary Indian Refining Company (IRC) owned the closed refinery. In September 2011, ownership transferred to Texaco Downstream Properties, Inc. Texaco is represented by Chevron Environmental Management Company (CEMC), which is performing the cleanup work.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Since 2007, CEMC has been removing underground pipelines and contaminated soil. Wastewater treatment is also ongoing.

EPA’s primary involvement at the site was oversight of two short-term cleanups, or removal actions, prior to the site’s listing on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2000. After the site’s listing on the NPL, cleanup has continued under Illinois EPA oversight. Illinois EPA provides detailed cleanup information to the public with a series of fact sheets at its website.

A Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) and Restoration Project is also underway, overseen by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Progress on NRDA activities at the site can be tracked [online](http://www.fws.gov/midwest/LawrencevilleNRDA).

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The former Indian Refinery contains large volumes of contaminants in groundwater and soil expected at a refinery such as benzene, naphthalene, ethylbenzene, toluene, semi-volatile organic compounds and lead.

### Sampling and Monitoring

### Emergency Response and Removal

Removal cleanup activities by EPA in 1997 included construction of collection pits in the oil seep area to capture oil discharge, pumping oil and water from collection pits to an oil-water separator, removal and placement of oil-soaked contaminated soils in one of three on-site bio-cells, and installation of a 760-foot interceptor trench with a gravity-fed collection sump. Collected oil and water from the interceptor trench is pumped to the oil-water separator and treatment facility. Treated effluent is discharged to the Embarras River. The interceptor trench and wastewater treatment system continues to operate; it has successfully kept Tank Farm B contamination from moving off site.  

### Enforcement Information

The site is being cleaned up under State enforcement authority. EPA has no federal enforcement actions in place at the site.
