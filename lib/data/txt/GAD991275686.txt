### Background

The Marzone Inc./Chevron Chemical Co. [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) Site is located in Tifton, Georgia.

Chevron Chemical Company owned and operated a pesticide and herbicide formulation plant on a portion of the Site. Chevron Chemical operated on the Site from 1950 to 1970. Several other companies, including Marzone Chemical Company, owned and operated the plant from 1970 until 1983. From the late 1960s until 1992, different companies, including Golden Seed Inc., operated a formulation and packaging plant for pesticides and fertilizers on another portion of the Site.

In 1989, the EPA added the site to the [Superfund Program’s National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n). Plant operations resulted in contamination of the soil, sediment and groundwater.

The EPA completed the [fifth Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11173749) in July 2022. It found that the cleanup at OU-1 and OU-2 continues to protect people and the environment in the short term.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The EPA divides sites into [Operable Units (OUs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#o) to make cleanup activities more efficient.

- PRPs lead site investigation and cleanup activities for OU-1, with oversight provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Georgia's Environmental Protection Division (EPD).
- The EPA leads investigation and cleanup activities for OU-2, in cooperation with Georgia EPD.

**1997**  
Starting in 1997, this former pesticide blending and packaging company conducted soil removal actions to address soil contamination, built/operated a pump-and-treat system to address groundwater and uses monitored natural attenuation to address contaminated groundwater.

Cleanup activities performed by the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP) at OU-1 included the removal of contaminated soil and sediment and using a funnel-and-gate system to channel groundwater through a system of trenches for treatment. Cleanup activities completed by EPA at OU-2 included:

- the removal of contaminated soil and sediment,
- monitored natural attenuation to address contaminated groundwater, and
- the placement of groundwater use restrictions.

***OU-1***

**1979 – 1984**  
Because of state enforcement efforts, the responsible parties removed pesticides and pesticide drums from OU-1 and closed a rinse pond.

**1985**  
In 1985, as part of a short-term cleanup action, the EPA removed additional pesticides and dug up ditch sediments.

**1994**  
In 1994, the EPA issued the long-term cleanup plan for OU-1. It included

- digging up and thermally treating soil and sediments
- installing a groundwater pump-and-treat system and fencing
- using institutional controls.

**1996 – 1999**  
From 1996 to 1999, PRPs completed soil cleanup activities for OU-1. In 1998, PRPs constructed the F&G groundwater treatment system, which continues to run.

**1997 – 2000**  
In 1997, the EPA revised the plan, selecting disposal of contaminated soil and sediment in a landfill instead of using thermal treatment. In 1998, the EPA revised the cleanup plan again to address dioxin (an additional chemical of concern) in the burn pit area. In 2000, the EPA revised the plan to change groundwater cleanup from a pump-and-treat system to an on-site funnel-and-gate (F&G) system.

***OU-2***

**1993**  
The EPA conducted a short-term cleanup action at OU-2 to remove chemicals, contaminated debris and heavily contaminated surface soils. The EPA demolished and removed several on-site structures, dug up and removed the first foot of soil in contaminated areas, dug up and removed contaminated below-surface soil and debris, and shipped the material to a permitted landfill.

**1999**  
The EPA issued the long-term cleanup plan for OU-2. It included:

- digging up contaminated soil and sediments and disposing of them in a landfill
- using monitored natural attenuation (MNA) for groundwater contamination
- using institutional controls to restrict groundwater use.

**2006**  
The EPA completed actions for contaminated soil and sediments. Monitored natural attenuation (MNA) was used for groundwater and sediment contamination.

**2007-2012**

Groundwater monitoring was performed in 2009. Three additional monitoring wells were installed in January 2010, and then groundwater monitoring was performed in January and November 2010. A Focusd Feasibility Study (FFS) was conducted in June 2012. In-Situ Chemical Reduction (ISCR) Treatability Testing was conducted in November 2012.

**2013-2019**

An ISCR Pilot Test was conducted in May 2014. Between September 2017 and April 2019, three groundwater monitoring events were conducted.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA published the [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11173749) in 2022. The remedy currently protects human health and the environment because contaminated soil and sediments have been excavated and replaced with clean fill and vegetated; the surrounding community is connected to a public water supply.

PRPs continue to use the F&G system and MNA for OU-1 groundwater contamination. The EPA continues to use MNA for OU-2 groundwater contamination. The EPA is evaluating the effectiveness of the approach.

For site remedies to be protective over the long term, additional groundwater institutional controls are necessary and enhancement of the groundwater remedies may be needed.

The EPA plans to complete the next Five-Year Review in July 2027.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Fencing surrounds its northern, western and eastern sides.

Groundwater use restrictions are in place.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, the EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA issued an order and negotiated legal agreements with Site PRPs to investigate and clean up the Site. The PRPs continue to fund OU-1 cleanup and monitoring activities.
