Background
The 62-acre Gary Development Landfill site is located in Gary, Indiana. The Gary Development Landfill was a permitted solid waste landfill that accepted unauthorized hazardous waste for disposal. The landfill operated from about 1975 to 1989. The landfill has no proper liners, no engineered cover and no functioning surface water run-on or runoff management systems in place. The company that owned the landfill is no longer in business. Site investigations and cleanup planning are ongoing.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In a letter dated August 21, 2015, EPA approved application of the 1993 EPA Directive No. 9355.0-49FS titled “Presumptive Remedy for CERCLA Municipal Landfill Sites” (presumptive remedy guidance) for conducting the RI. The objective of the presumptive remedy guidance is to use past programmatic experience to streamline site investigation and the remedy selection process. The presumptive remedy for the Site is containment/capping, which eliminates or reduces risks by mitigating exposure pathways for the landfill portion of the site. The document titled Remedial Investigation Report for the Gary Development Landfill Superfund Site (RI Report) was prepared for the Gary Development Landfill Superfund Site on January 7, 2019 by Parsons on behalf of the Gary Development Landfill PRP Group. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conditionally approved the RI Report on March 15, 2019, because it was determined that the RI did not fully characterize the Site. EPA required preparation of the following documents to define the nature and extent of contamination: an updated Ecological Risk Assessment, a Remedial Action Objectives (RAOs) Technical Memo, an Alternatives Screening Technical Memo, and, if further required by EPA, a Comparative Analysis of Alternatives Technical Memo. The following documents pertaining to the RI/FS were subsequently provided to EPA: 
Revised Remedial Action Objectives Technical Memorandum (RAO Tech Memo) dated June 28, 2019 and prepared by de maximis, inc. Approved by EPA on September 30, 2019.
Revised Screening Level Ecological Risk Assessment for Gary Development Landfill dated October 28, 2019 and prepared by de maximis, inc. as an addendum to the RI Report. Approved by EPA on November 15, 2019.
Remedial Investigation Report Addendum, Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) – June 2019 Groundwater Sampling Results dated March 18, 2020 and prepared by Parsons Corporation. 
EPA received a draft FS Report on July 2, 2020, prepared by Parsons Corporation. EPA provided a notice of deficiency on the Draft FS Report to the PRPs on November 30, 2020. A revised draft FS Report dated June 9, 2021 and prepared by Weaver Consultants Group North Central, LLC was provided to EPA to replace the draft FS Report from 2020. In an EPA memorandum titled EPA Comments Related to Groundwater and Operable Unit Designation Changes from Review of the Draft Feasibility Study Report dated June 9, 2021 dated October 27, 2022, EPA disapproved the draft 2021 FS Report’s conclusions related to groundwater. The memo documented the need for additional characterization of groundwater and new operable unit (OU) designations. Pursuant to EPA’s memo, the OUs designated for the Site are as follows: 
OU1: The Site-wide OU to be used exclusively for the remaining site RI activities. OU1 will not be used following the approval of the final RI Addendum.
OU2: The source area (landfill) OU that will be addressed by the Presumptive Remedy approach, and impacted media (landfill contents, soil vapor, sediment, surface water, fish tissue) excluding groundwater.
OU3: The groundwater OU at the Site consisting of groundwater within the source area as well as groundwater outside the landfill waste boundary. 
From August to September 2023, supplemental source area (landfill) investigation activities were conducted that includes a geotechnical evaluation and supplemental delineation of non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) under OU2, and further characterization of contaminated groundwater under OU3. The additional RI work resolved data gaps identified for OU2 for evaluation of a range of remedial alternatives to address contamination in site media (except groundwater) in accordance with the requirements of CERCLA. An RI Addendum that is a continuation of the 2019 RI Report and documents the results of the investigation performed in August and September 2023 is currently in draft. However, EPA has concluded that RI activities performed to date do not fully characterize the nature and extent of contaminated groundwater under OU3. Following the supplemental source area investigation activities, groundwater within the landfill will be sampled for eight consecutive quarters, followed by biannual groundwater monitoring through landfill cap construction (a remedial action under OU2). Following the landfill cap construction, groundwater within the landfill will be sampled for eight consecutive quarters. Subsequently, the groundwater monitoring data within the landfill will be reviewed and a separate groundwater investigation outside the landfill may be performed. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
 In 2022, EPA documented the need for additional source area and groundwater characterization and new operable unit (OU) designations. The OUs designated for the Site are as follows: OU1: The Site-wide OU to be used exclusively for the remaining site RI activities. OU1 will not be used following the approval of the final RI Addendum. OU2: The source area (landfill) OU that will be addressed by the Presumptive Remedy approach, and impacted media (landfill contents, soil vapor, sediment, surface water, fish tissue) excluding groundwater. OU3: The groundwater OU at the Site consisting of groundwater within the source area as well as groundwater outside the landfill waste boundary. From August to September 2023, supplemental Remedial Investigation (RI) activities were performed for site media under OU2 and OU3. The work performed completes all RI activities for OU2. An RI Addendum that documents the results of the investigation is currently in draft. Following approval of the RI Addendum, a draft Feasibility Study will be provided for OU2. EPA concluded that RI activities performed to date do not fully characterize the nature and extent of contaminated groundwater. Therefore, RI work under OU3 is ongoing. Following the RI activities performed from August to September 2023, eight quarters of groundwater monitoring will be performed within the landfill and will be followed by biannual groundwater monitoring through landfill cap construction (a remedial action under OU2). Following landfill cap construction, groundwater within the landfill will be sampled for eight consecutive quarters. Subsequently, the groundwater monitoring data within the landfill will be reviewed and a separate groundwater investigation outside the landfill may be performed.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.

Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup. For more background, see Institutional Controls. The landfill accepted unauthorized hazardous waste including volatile organic compounds, semi-volatile organic compounds, metals, polychlorinated biphenyls, asbestos and pesticides, in addition to household waste. Contaminants from the site have been found in a nearby wetland. This wetland borders the Grand Calumet River, is designated as freshwater palustrine emergent wetland, and is home to several bird species – such as the marsh wren – that the state considers to be endangered.

Emergency Response and Removal
 In 2002, EPA completed an emergency cleanup at the site, removing numerous containers of substances, including oils, paint, insecticides, antifreeze and electrical capacitors. Top of Page
Enforcement Information
 On May 5, 2014, U.S. EPA entered into a settlement agreement with approximately 20 responsible parties that will conduct an in-depth environmental investigation at the Site, none of whom currently own the property.    EPA attempted to obtain voluntary access to three vacant parcels of property comprising the site without success in September 2014.  An application for Ex Parte Administrative Warrant for Entry Inspection, Investigation and Sampling pursuant to Section 104(e) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. § 9604(e) was filed with the United States District Court for Northern Indiana by the U.S. Department of Justice on September 17, 2014.  The purpose of the warrant is to secure legal permission to be on the Site property for EPA and the responsible parties that will do the investigation work with EPA oversight. On October 9, 2014, the warrant was signed by the U.S. District Court for Northern Indiana. Since that time, two extensions of time for the warrant were filed October 12, 2016 and April 22, 2019 to assure that access to the entire site is not disrupted in the event of a tax sale of one or more parcels comprising the site.  On 6/6/2023, a voluntary access agreement was signed which allows unencumbered access to the entire site.
