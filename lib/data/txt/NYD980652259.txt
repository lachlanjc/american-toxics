Background
The Wide Beach Development site is located in Brant, New York. The site is a 55-acre suburban development of 60 homes in a small community on Lake Erie, north of the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation. Lake Erie is the western boundary of the Wide Beach Development. When temperatures climb and Lake Erie begins to thaw, residents of the Wide Beach Development in Brant, New York, prepare for the annual migration of summer vacationers to this scenic resort town. Vacationers and homeowners alike come to this area for the beauty and relaxation that Lake Erie has to offer. From 1968 to 1978, the Wide Beach Homeowners' Association applied about 155 cubic meters of waste oil to the local roadways to control dust. Some of the oil was contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The oil applications contaminated roads, driveways, storm drains and homes. In 1980, workers excavated soil from the roadways to install a sanitary sewer line in the development. Unaware that a PCB problem existed, some residents used this soil as fill in their yards and in a community recreational area. Subsequent sampling revealed PCBs in the air, road dust, soil, vacuum cleaner dust and water samples from private wells. After the performance of emergency response actions to protect human health and site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1983. A remedial investigation and feasibility study was conducted from 1984 and 1985 to determine the nature and extent of the contamination at and emanating from the site, to assess the threat the site poses to public health and the environment, and to develop and evaluate various alternatives to remediate the site.   Based upon this effort, a remedy was selected in 1985.   The remedy included excavation and chemical treatment of about 37,600 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated soils from the site's roadways, drainage ditches, driveways, yards, and wetlands; backfilling of the excavated areas with the treated soil; treatment of the perched water in the sewer trench; and construction of a hydraulic barrier at the end of the sewer trench, as the long-term remedial measure for the site.  The remedial action was performed from 1990-1992.  The site was deleted from the National Priorities List in 1994.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Emergency Actions: In 1985, in response to the levels of PCBs found in dust in Wide Beach Development homes, EPA acted to protect residents until a long-term remedy could be applied. This emergency action included paving roadways, driveways and drainage ditches; decontaminating homes by vacuuming, rug shampooing, and replacing air conditioner and furnace filters; installing particulate filters on individual wells; and repairing a storm drain to alleviate flooding problems.Long-Term Cleanup: After a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the nature and extent of the contamination and to identify and evaluate remedial alternatives, EPA selected the site-wide remedy in a 1985 Record of Decision. It called for: (1) excavating PCB-contaminated soils in the roadways, drainage ditches, driveways, yards and wetlands; (2) chemically treating the PCB-contaminated soils; (3) backfilling excavated areas with treated soils; and (4) repaving roadways and driveways. Cleanup started in March 1990, and the treatment of contaminated soils finished in September 1991. In all, 36,160 tons of PCB-contaminated soils and sediments from site roadways, drainage ditches, driveways, yards and wetlands were treated. Wetlands restoration finished in September 1992.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site was addressed in two stages: emergency response actions and a long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site. Cleanup of PCB-contaminated soils and sediments was carried out in 1991 and 1992. After completion of the site’s cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1994
