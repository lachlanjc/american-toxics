### Background

The 10-acre Old Inland Pit site is located in Spokane, Washington. Inland Asphalt operated as a sand and gravel source from 1969 to 1978. Materials were excavated to a depth of 35 to 50 feet below ground surface. Spokane Steel Foundry Company (SSFC), located just east of the pit, disposed of waste foundry sands and baghouse dust on site from May 1978 to May 1983 and foundry sand disposal continued until 1986. In addition, Inland Asphalt gave permission to Central Permix to dispose of construction debris and to Quarry Tile Company for disposal of broken decorative clay tiles. After site investigations found that soil cleanup was not necessary, long-term monitoring is ongoing.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Old Inland Pit site, located in Spokane, Washington, was a 10-acre former gravel pit that was mined between 1969-1976. From 1978 to 1983 a steel foundry disposed of 200 tons of baghouse dust at the site. The site is located over the sole source aquifer for 30,000 people within a three mile radius. The soil was investigated to determine the extent of contamination with elevated levels of heavy metals. Pursuant to the State Cleanup Action Plan and EPA’s Notice of Deletion, no action was required or is anticipated under CERCLA. This site was deleted from the NPL on August 31, 1999 without the need for subsequent five year reviews.

The site is being addressed through state actions. In 1994, Ecology assumed responsibility for all aspects of remedial response activities.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) conducted the site’s remedial investigation in 1998 and concluded that no soil remediation was necessary. Ecology issued a cleanup plan in early 1999 that included the need for a restrictive covenant pursuant to state Law and long-term monitoring.

EPA took the site off the NPL in 1999 without the need for subsequent Five-Year Reviews.  

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Before the site Remedial Investigation was completed, the the potential contaminants of concern were heavy metals in soil from baghouse dust, including arsenic, chromium, zinc, and aluminum.
