### Background

The 95-acre Mountain Pine Pressure Treating site is located in Plainview, Arkansas. The site consists of three inactive abandoned wood-treating facilities that operated from the mid-1960s to the late 1980s. Wood-treating operations used solutions of pentachlorophenol (PCP) and copper chromated arsenate (CCA). Following cleanup, groundwater monitoring is ongoing.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and local actions. EPA has conducted one five-year review of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

The site consists of three separate inactive abandoned wood-treating facilities. The Mountain Pine Pressure Treating plant and the CCA plant operated from March 1962 until about February 1986. Plainview Lumber Co. operated from 1965 to 1986, reopening briefly during the summer of 1989. The site includes inactive wood-preserving facilities where owners pressure treated structural timbers with solutions of PCP and CCA.The site consists of three separate inactive abandoned wood-treating facilities.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included excavation, treatment and stabilization of contaminated soils and sediments, and backfilling of excavated areas with treated materials. The remedy also implemented institutional controls to restrict future development. Cleanup activities finished in 2005. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. A removal action in 1987 and 1988 contained about 2,500 cubic yards of sludge and capped the mass with two feet of clay.
