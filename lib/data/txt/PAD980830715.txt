### Background

The 135-acre York County Solid Waste and Refuse Authority Landfill site is located in Hopewell Township, Pennsylvania. The site includes an inactive municipal landfill with three unlined cells and is part of the more than 300-acre York County Sanitary Landfill property. Waste disposal contaminated groundwater. EPA added the site to the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1987. Following cleanup, the site was deleted from the NPL in 2005. Groundwater treatment is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Following completion of the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study, EPA selected a cleanup plan in a [Record of Decision (ROD)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/133496) [(PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/133496) in December 1994. The remedial action selected to restore groundwater to background levels as established by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection or to drinking water maximum contaminant levels (MCLs), whichever is more stringent, consisted of the following:

- Continued operation of the groundwater recovery and treatment system put in place by York County Solid Waste Authority (YCSWA) under the 1984 State Agreement.
- Continued operation and maintenance of the point of entry groundwater treatment filter systems required by the 1984 State Agreement and/or provision of bottled water for affected private wells as necessary.
- Continued maintenance of the landfill’s soil and vegetated cap and the passive gas venting system at the landfill.
- Continued periodic sampling of groundwater and treated water to ensure that treatment components are effective and groundwater remediation is progressing toward required cleanup levels.
- Implementation of a monitoring program to assess the effectiveness of the groundwater treatment system and its impact on downgradient surface water and wetland habitat.
- Implementation of a monitoring program to assess the impact of the treated effluent discharge on the environmental quality of the surface waters and sediments in the streams where the outfalls are located.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent, [2022 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/03/2329199.pdf), concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The groundwater collection and treatment system is functioning properly by providing hydraulic containment of contaminated groundwater at the Site, with the exception of the area to the south where YC-3 is located. The current extraction system prevents Site-related contaminants from migrating off-Site to residential water supply wells, and reduces the levels of contaminants in the groundwater; the vegetated soil cap is in place and is being maintained; YCSWA continues to provide residents with point-of-entry filtration devices; and controls are in place to prevent potential exposures. If monitoring results in proximity to YC-3 indicate that contamination is migrating beyond the boundary of the landfill, an additional extraction well should be added to the area. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2027.

EPA continues to conduct periodic site visits, and review quarterly and annual progress reports.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls are in place to restrict groundwater use and to protect the cap. Additional information about the institutional controls are available in the [2022 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/03/2329199.pdf) (page 8).
