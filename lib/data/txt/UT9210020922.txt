### Background

The Ogden Defense Depot (DLA) site is located in Weber County, Utah, about 40 miles north of Salt Lake City. Activated in 1941, this former military installation served as a warehousing and distribution facility. Ogden Defense Depot was one of seven warehousing and distribution depots operated nationwide by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). At one time, it served as a storage and distribution facility for medical, industrial, construction and electronic supplies as well as food, clothing and petroleum products for military installations and other federal agencies. In 1964, the facility was renamed the Defense Distribution Depot Ogden, Utah (DDOU). Other items that may have been stored at DDOU in the past include containers of mustard gas and chemical warfare agent identification kits. Until the late 1970s, facility operations included on-site disposal of liquid and solid materials, incineration of oily liquid materials and combustible solvents in on-site burning pits, and burning and burial of solid wastes. These activities contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1989, DDOU, EPA and Utah Department of Environmental Quality (UDEQ) signed a Federal Facility Agreement (FFA). It specified the process by which decisions would be made for the cleanup and established cleanup goals. EPA divided the site into four separate areas, or operable units (OUs), to better address site cleanup. OU1 is located in the southwestern part of the site and includes the southern part of the backfilled Plain City Canal and a shallow groundwater plume. OU-2 includes three areas of soil contamination and a groundwater plume: the French Drain Area, the Former Pesticide Storage Building (Building 51), the Former Burn Pits Parade Ground Area and the OU2 Plume. OU3 is located near the southwestern corner of the former Depot and consists of four separate disposal areas: Burial Sites 1, 3-A, 3-B and 3-C, and the Mustard Storage Facility. OU4 is next to the northern site boundary. It consists of Burial Sites 4-A through 4-E, the Oil Burning Pit Area, the OU4 hotspot and former disposal trenches, and a plume of contaminated groundwater.

The siteâ€™s long-term remedy included extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater; excavation and off-site disposal or incineration of contaminated soil; and incineration of 1,000 gallons of a light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL)/water mixture. Cleanup also included the injection of soybean vegetable oil to form a bioreactive wall across the contaminated shallow aquifer; construction and operation of a groundwater extraction trench along the western boundary of the former depot; ozonation treatment of the water extracted from the trench; and institutional controls. Remedy construction took place between 1994 and 1995. Groundwater treatment and monitoring is ongoing.
