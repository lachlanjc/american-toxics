### Background

The 1.6-acre Northwest Transformer (Mission/Pole) site is located in Whatcom County, Washington. Between 1958 and 1985, the Northwest Transformer Service Company stored, repaired and recycled electrical transformers and capacitors on site, and used the property as a salvage yard. Site activities also included dismantling and reclaiming equipment, burning transformer casings in an open burn pit, burning waste oils in a space heater, and draining transformer oils into a seepage pit. These activities contaminated soil with polychlorinated biphenyls ( [PCBs](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=PCB) ) and solvents. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1999. No further cleanup actions are required at the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil; demolition and off-site disposal of the on-site barn; placement of a clean soil cover; and institutional controls. Remedy construction took place between 1992 and 1994. Institutional controls remain in place.  

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1999.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions in 1985 included building a fence, excavating and disposing of about 1,400 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated soil and debris, and removing over 6,500 gallons of [PCB](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=PCB) -contaminated liquid.
