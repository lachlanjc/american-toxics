### Background

The 23-acre Ordot Landfill site is Guam’s primary landfill for industrial and municipal waste near Ordot and Chalan Pago. Site investigations revealed leachate flowing from the site to the Lonfit River. EPA deferred cleanup to EPA’s Water Program in 1998. The Government of Guam is working to close the old landfill and to fund and construct a new landfill.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and territorial actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that EPA expects the remedy to be protective of human health and the environment upon completion. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires completion of the remedy, including the closure of the Ordot Landfill and the construction of a new Municipal Solid Waste Landfill.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

**Initial Actions**

The Guam Department of Public Works reduced the discharge of leachate from the site by installing a diversion ditch upgradient of the landfill that diverted water from a creek away from the landfill. Waste cover practices improved, helping to stabilize the landfill. In 1992, EPA installed two monitoring wells, but these did not detect contaminants.  

**Remedy Selected**

EPA deferred cleanup to EPA’s Water Program in 1988 because the site was still an operating landfill and did not pose an imminent and substantial threat to human health or the environment. A Clean Water Act Consent Decree required the Government of Guam to close the landfill and prevent discharge of pollutants and construct and operate a new landfill.
