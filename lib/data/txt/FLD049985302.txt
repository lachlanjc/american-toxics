### Background

The 57-acre Zellwood [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in Orange County, Florida, approximately a half-mile west of Zellwood and 25 miles northwest of Orlando. Several active industrial facilities as well as some undeveloped properties, including an open field and wooded wetlands, are located on the site. The site’s surroundings include residential developments, a nursery, citrus groves, and pastureland, as well as several other businesses.

Numerous companies have operated in this industrial area since the early 1960s. Beginning in 1963, Drum Service Company of Florida, a drum recycling facility, used two unlined ponds for treatment and disposal of wastewater generated as part of its operations. The Southern Liquid Fertilizer Company began operating at the site in 1970s. In 1980, the company redesigned its treatment system and stopped using these ponds for wastewater disposal.

In 1981, the plant began to operate under another owner, the Douglas Fertilizer and Chemical Company. The same year, operators drained the ponds and sent contaminated sediments to an off-site landfill. Operators then filled in the ponds with clean soil. These businesses discharged wastewater from their production process and wash water used during in-house cleaning into three unlined lagoons. The Zellwin Farms Company also operated a vegetable washing and packing plant in the area from 1960 to 1983. The facility discharged wastewater from the vegetable washing process into drainage ditches along Jones Avenue.

EPA placed the site on the [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1983 because of contaminated groundwater, sediment and soil resulting from facility operations. The site's [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) agreed to lead the site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and the [Florida Department of nvironmental Protection (FDEP)](https://floridadep.gov/).

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site's [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) agreed to lead the site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by the EPA and the [Florida Department of nvironmental Protection (FDEP)](https://floridadep.gov/).

Site investigations and cleanup activities have focused on two areas, which EPA refers to as operable units, or OUs. These areas include

- OU-1: contaminated soil and sediment
- OU-2: contaminated groundwater.

| When | What |
| --- | --- |
| **1987** | The site’s long-term remedy for OU-1 was selected in 1987 and updated in 1990. It included  - digging up contaminated soils and sediment - solidifying and disposing of the contaminated soil and sediment on site. |
| **1994** | The site’s PRPs cleaned up OU-1 in two phases.  In Phase 1, PRPs excavated and stockpiled 7,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil and sediment. They then sampled the area to make sure they dug up all contaminated material.  In Phase 2, the PRPs solidified all contaminated material into a concrete structure referred to as a monolith. The PRPs then completed the monolith by covering it with soil and planted it with grass to prevent erosion. |
| **2000** | The site’s long-term remedy for OU-2, included:  - using monitored natural attenuation for groundwater contaminants - installing permanent groundwater monitoring wells - evaluating the effectiveness of monitored natural attenuation - implementing institutional controls in the form of EPA-issued groundwater use advisories and zoning regulations. |
| **2002** | The site’s PRPs started monitoring OU-2 after installing two pairs of downgradient monitoring wells. Current groundwater data shows that contaminant levels in the majority of the groundwater monitoring wells are declining or stable. However, contaminant levels in a few monitoring wells have increased. EPA is requiring additional sampling to investigate these increases. In addition, groundwater samples have found volatile organic compounds in groundwater not related to the site. EPA is currently investigating the source of this additional contamination. |
| **2016** | The site’s fourth Five-Year Review, completed in September, stated that additional information would need to be collected before the EPA could determine whether the site’s cleanup approach continues to protect people and the environment from remaining site contamination. In the Five-Year Review, the EPA anticipated it would take 18 months to collect the necessary information. The site's cleanup approach is being evaluated. The evaluation will be documented in an addendum report to the fourth Five-Year Review. |
| **2018** | The site's cleanup approach was evaluated and documented in an addendum report to the fourth Five-Year Review. |
| **2021** | The EPA completed the site's [fifth Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11160826.pdf). |
| **2024** | The EPA issued an Exaplanation of Significant Differences (ESD) for OU-2. This ESD updates the cleanup levels for groundwater contaminants of concern. |

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [fifth Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11160826.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2021.

EPA will collaborate with FDEP to evaluate volatile organic compounds onsite and offsite.

EPA is working with the PRP on assessing the need for a vapor intrusion study at the site.

EPA is also working with the PRP on updating Zellwood's Operations & Maintenance Plan to include requirements for evaluating OU-1 and OU-2 monitoring wells more frequently.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

EPA implemented institutional controls in the form issued groundwater use advisories and zoning regulations.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

In 2001, EPA entered into a legal agreement with several site PRPs – Drum Service Company of Florida, IFCO Industrial Container Systems - FL, LLC and IFCO Industrial Container Systems, Inc. – to implement site cleanup activities. IFCO Industrial Container Systems - FL, LLC maintains the monolith and provides annual ground water sampling reports to EPA.
