### Background

The 65-acre Miami County Incinerator site is comprised of an inactive incinerator and several landfills which opened in 1968 to process and dispose of municipal and industrial wastes. Large volumes of combustible and non-combustible wastes were landfilled there. Liquid wastes, including oils and solvents, were also dumped or buried. A contaminated plume of organic chemicals flowed from the liquid disposal area into the nearby Great Miami River. This plume contaminated wells of many residents who live near the site. The companies determined to be responsible for the contamination connected homes with affected wells to public water supplies.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The siteâ€™s long-term cleanup included capping of several areas, soil vapor extraction (SVE) to address contaminated soil, and groundwater extraction and treatment. Between four and six million gallons of contaminated groundwater are sent to the Troy treatment plant for treatment each month. The SVE system met cleanup goals in April 2005 and was shut down.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is conducting its sixth five-year review of the Miami County Incinerator Superfund Site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up - with waste managed on-site - to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. A summary of the cleanup activities and an evaluation of the protectiveness of the implemented cleanup remedies will be included in the five-year review report.

Cleanup actions at the site included extracting and treating groundwater, addressing soil contamination through a soil vapor extraction system, and capping several areas. The review is expected to be completed in June 2025.
