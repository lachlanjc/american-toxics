### Background

The Fairfield Coal Gasification Plant Site is a former manufactured gas plant (FMGP) located in Fairfield, Jefferson County, Iowa which has a population of approximately 10,000 residents. The site property is located at 107 South Seventh Street. The 1.3 acre site is bounded on the north side by Burlington Street, on the east by residential property, on the south by an electrical substation and a salvage operation and on the west by 7th Street and residential property. The site area is primarily residential with commercial businesses to the north of Burlington Street. The majority of the site property is currently used as an electrical substation.

The FMGP operations from 1878 until 1950 involved the production of coal gas. Coal tar sludge, iron oxide wastes and associated coal gasification wastes were generated at the plant during operations. In 1950, the gas production system in Fairfield was converted to natural gas, and operations at the MGP were terminated. An undetermined amount of MGP wastes were disposed or left in in-ground containment structures such as the gas holder pit, tar separator and relief gas holder. Compounds commonly found in coal tar include polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzene, ethylbenzene, toulene, and xylenes (BTEXs).

The site was discovered in 1985 when PAH compounds were found in both in soil and groundwater on the site. According to the remedial investigation completed in 1990, the gas holder pit, tar separator and relief gas holder were determined to be the sources of groundwater contamination at the site. The site was subsequently placed on the final National Priorities List (NPL) in August 1990.

The sixth Five-Year Review for the site was signed on June 14, 2022. The review determined the remedy at the site currently protects human health and the environment in the short-term. For the remedy to be protective in the long-term, an evaluation of additional remedial alternatives needs to be conducted to support a decision document modification. This is required since groundwater cleanup levels have not been achieved since the selected remedy of groundwater extraction and treatment was not effective in treating contaminated groundwater in a reasonable timeframe.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In April 1989, the respondents and the EPA entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study and construct and operate an interim groundwater extraction and treatment system to contain the migration of the groundwater contamination. The EPA issued a Record of Decision in 1990 selecting the remedial action to address contamination associated with the site. The major components of the selected remedy included: the off-site inceneration of the coal tar source areas and areas of contaminated soil; the treatment of contaminated groundwater by filtration, polymer injection and settling and carbon adsorption systems; and the in-situ treatment of coal gas migration areas involving the injection of nutrients into the aquifer to stimulate biological degradation.

The interim groundwater extraction and treatment system was constructed in 1989. The treatment system was modified and approved by the EPA as a permanent groundwater treatment system in 1993. An in-situ bioremediation pilot study began in 1991 but was determined ineffective due to the hydrogeologic conditions at the site. Remediation of the coal tar source material was completed in 1995 and included excavation of contaminated soils to a depth of six to 16 feet below ground surface from multiple locations across the site. The groundwater extraction and treatment system was shut down in 2001 due to low pumping capacities. It is estimated approximately 1,900 gallons of dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) was extracted from the aquifer during the operational period of the groundwater extraction and treatment system. Following shut down of the groundwater extraction and treatment system, monitored natural attenuation (MNA) was evaluated as a potential remedial technology since groundwater concentrations exceeded the cleanup levels. It was determined that MNA was not a viable remedial technology to achieve the cleanup levels associated with the site. Since 2001, routine groundwater monitoring has been conducted to ensure the plume is stable and not migrating off-site.

In 2021, a Focused Feasibility Study (FS) was initiated to evaluate additional remedial alternatives to address the remaining DNAPL and associated groundwater contamination at the site since the concentrations of contaminants of concern in groundwater exceed the cleanup levels. The Focused FS will support a decision document modification.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The groundwater extraction and treatment system remains shut down. Routine groundwater monitoring is ongoing to ensure the plume is stable and not migrating off-site. A Focused Feasibility Study was initiated in 2021 to evaluate additional remedial alternatives to address the remaining dense non-aqueous phase liquid and associated groundwater contamination at the site since concentrations of contaminants of concern in groundwater exceed the cleanup levels selected in the 1990 Record of Decision. The Focused FS will support a decision document modification.

In May 2021, an Environmental Covenant was recorded with Jefferson County, which describes the activity and use limitations for the site property.

The sixth Five-Year Review for the site was signed on June 14, 2022. The review determined the remedy at the site currently protects human health and the environment in the short-term. For the remedy to be protective in the long-term, an evaluation of additional remedial alternatives needs to be conducted to support a decision document modification. This is required since groundwater cleanup levels have not been achieved since the selected remedy of groundwater extraction, and treatment was not effective in treating contaminated groundwater in a reasonable timeframe.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Annual groundwater sampling since 2005.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Under EPA oversight, the respondent installed a groundwater extraction and treatment system to contain and treat contaminated groundwater.
