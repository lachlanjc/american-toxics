Background
The 15-acre Middletown Road Dump Site is located in Annapolis, Maryland. The now-inactive dump took in rubble, construction debris, and municipal and industrial waste for several decades without proper state permits. In 1981, the State of Maryland discovered about 40 crushed and deteriorating drums and four dumpster loads of debris contaminated with hazardous substances such as paint sludge and solvents. Operations contaminated soil with heavy metals and other chemicals. EPA added the Site to the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983. Cleanup activities included the removal and off-site disposal of drums, contaminated soil and debris. After completing cleanup activities, EPA deleted the Site from the NPL in 1988. The clean-up objectives for the site were accomplished. EPA will not conduct additional five-year reviews of the site since no waste was left in place and clean up objectives were accomplished.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In 1986, EPA issued a “no action” Record of Decision (ROD) for the Site. The ROD recommended groundwater monitoring. EPA required no action because an emergency cleanup completed in 1983 adequately addressed Site contamination. Samples taken since then confirm that the contamination has been addressed.

What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the Site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by Site decision documents. The most recent and final, 2012 Five-Year Review (PDF), concluded that response actions at the Site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. Since the contaminant levels allow unlimited use and unrestricted exposure at the Site, no further five-year reviews will be conducted for the Site. Top of Page
Emergency Response and Removal
In 1983, EPA and the state completed an emergency cleanup to remove immediate threats from contamination. Contaminated media removed from the Site included 68 drums, 70 contaminated tires, 610 tons of contaminated soil and numerous 5-gallon pails of marine paint. EPA and the state intensively investigated Site conditions during and after the emergency cleanup. The study evaluated groundwater, surface water, soil, air and sediment in the vicinity of the Site. EPA concluded that the emergency cleanup actions successfully eliminated the hazardous wastes and that no threat to public health or the environment remained. Top of Page
