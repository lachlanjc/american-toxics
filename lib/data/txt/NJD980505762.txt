### Background

During the 1930s, a pig farm was located on site. Landfilling operations began in 1945. In addition to accepting municipal solid waste from several counties in northern New Jersey, the landfill allegedly received hazardous and toxic materials between 1962 and 1969 from Ciba-Geigy Company. Records indicate that about 560,000 pounds of toluene, 130,000 pounds of benzene, 40,000 pounds of chloroform, 20,000 pounds of methylene chloride and 3,000 pounds of dichloroethylene were disposed of at the site.

From April 13, 1972 to May 10, 1972, about 25,700 tons of non-chemical wastes and 1,160 tons of liquid and chemical wastes, described as cesspool-type, were deposited at the landfill. Sludge from the adjacent Parsippany-Troy Hills STP was also deposited in the landfill. Sharkey Farms ceased landfill operations on September 9, 1972. The Sharkey Landfill is believed to have remained inactive until 1979, when excavation began for the expansion of the Parsippany-Troy Hills STP. Several acres of refuse were removed from the South Fill area and redisposed of in the North Fill area. No evidence of chemical waste disposal was reported during the excavation. The expansion project finished in 1981. Since that time, the site has apparently remained unchanged.

After investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List on September 8, 1983.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA selected a remedy to address contaminated soil, surface water and groundwater in the site’s 1986 Record of Decision (ROD). It called for: (1) capping of the landfill; (2) a venting system for landfill gases and extraction and treatment of shallow groundwater and leachate; (3) surface water controls to handle rainfall, storm runoff and erosion of river banks; (4) security fencing to restrict site access; and (5) a long-term groundwater monitoring program.

EPA updated the site’s remedy in September 1993. A reevaluation of site circumstances and conditions resulted in a more limited capping scenario than originally planned. Only those portions of the North and South Fill areas of slopes less than or equal to three horizontal to one vertical (3:1) were capped. Remaining portions of the fill areas, as well as the three other fill areas, were covered with soil and vegetation, as necessary. Additionally, groundwater extraction systems are only being operated at the North and South Fill areas, unless groundwater monitoring shows the need for operation of the extraction systems at any of the other fill areas as well. Construction of the remedy started in September 2000 and was completed in March 2004.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in a single long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.

The final remedial design was completed in May 2000. Site mobilization began on August 7, 2000 and construction activities began on September 5, 2000. On December 29, 2003, remedial construction activities at the Site were substantially completed. A Superfund Preliminary Site Close Out Report was issued on March 9, 2004, indicating that construction activities necessary for the protection of human health and the environment had been completed.

In 2014, EPA approved the PRPs’ request to shut down the extraction system to determine whether it was still needed. In October 2023, well drilling began to install off-site monitoring wells to determine if landfill contamination is migrating from the Site. In the spring of 2024, the off-site wells were sampled.

The third five-year review report was issued on September 30, 2019 and the fourth was issued on September 4,2024.
