### Background

The Koppers [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located on State Route 54 (Chapel Hill Road), one mile northwest of Morrisville, Wake County, North Carolina. Residences border the site to the north. Residences and industrial land use border the site to the south. Church Street and a residential area border the site to the west. State Route 54 (Chapel Hill Road) borders the site to the east.

The site includes four areas

- the 33-acre Unit Structures, Inc. property
- the 17-acre Beazer East, Inc. property
- the 5-acre Medlin Pond area
- the 4.5-acre Seagondollar area.

In 1997, the EPA deleted the Unit Structures, Inc. property area from the NPL. A wood processing facility currently operates on the Unit Structures, Inc. property.

The Beazer East, Inc. property includes a former wood preserving process area, two former wastewater lagoons and a 3-acre manmade fire pond. Fencing surrounds the property area and gates control access.

The Medlin Pond area is located across McCrimmon Parkway from the manmade fire pond.

The Seagondollar area is located 2.5 miles west of the Unit Structures, Inc. and Beazer East, Inc. properties and includes a wetlands mitigation area owned by the Brian Seagondollar family.

From 1968 until 1975, Koppers Company, Inc. operated a wood treating facility at the site. Operations produced wastewater, which the company treated before its release into on-site lagoons. In 1975, the company demolished the treatment facility. In 1977, the company closed the on-site lagoons and sprayed the wastewater over two fields on site.

The remedy at the Site currently protects human health and the environment because contaminated soil and surface water have been addressed and there are no complete exposure pathways for contaminated ground water.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Beazer East, Inc., the site’s [potentially responsbile party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), leads site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and

[North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (](https://deq.nc.gov/) [NCDENR)](https://deq.nc.gov/).

**1980s**  
In 1980 and 1986, the site’s PRP removed 1,500 cubic yards of contaminated soil from the former lagoons and disposed of it at an off-site facility.

In 1989, the PRP installed three miles of water lines, connecting residences near the site to the public water supply.

**1992**  
In 1992, EPA issued the site’s long-term cleanup plan. It included

- excavating contaminated soil and incinerating it at an off-site facility
- using a pump-and-treat system to address groundwater contamination
- dewatering and backfilling two on-site ponds
- treating contaminated surface water using carbon absorption
- mitigating wetlands loss due to cleanup activities.

**1995 – 1996**  
The PRP dug up 775 tons of contaminated soil and incinerated it at an off-site facility, backfilled and reseeded the dug-up areas, dewatered and backfilled the on-site ponds with clean soil, and implemented the wetlands mitigation.

The PRP also constructed and began operation of the groundwater pump-and-treat system in 1996.

**1997**  
The PRP completed cleanup activities.

EPA removed the site from the NPL in 1997. In 1997, the EPA deleted the Unit Structures, Inc. property area from the NPL. A wood processing facility currently operates on the Unit Structures, Inc. property.

**2010**  
The PRP conducted a pilot study to evaluate alternative approaches to address groundwater contamination. The PRP found an additional source area of contamination during the pilot study.

**2014**  
The PRP conducted soil sampling and a risk evaluation and determined residual dioxin risk is present on site and submitted a report to EPA in November 2014. The results indicated that dioxin/furans concentrations in some surface soil beyond the 1996 remediation limits exceed the direct contact commercial/industrial screening level of 727ng/kg. The EPA completed a re-evaluation of residual dioxin risk at the Site based on the new toxicity values. This re-evaluation will determine whether additional response action is needed to address this residual dioxin risk.

**2022**  
A [Five Year Review](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11174401) was published September 2022.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The most recent [Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11174401) was published September 2022. The remedy at the Site currently protects human health and the environment because contaminated soil and surface water have been addressed and there are no complete exposure pathways for contaminated groundwater. However, in order for the remedy to be protective in the long term, the following actions need to be taken to ensure long-term protectiveness:

- Implement groundwater and land use institutional controls. Record the need for land use restrictions in a decision document.
- Determine if dioxin soil concentrations across the Site are protective for industrial land use. Additional sampling might be needed in areas where sampling has not occurred or where historical data are not available.
- Address unacceptable dioxin risk in soil in the former lagoon and process area. Record the selection action in a decision document.
- Additional sampling might be needed in areas where sampling has not occurred or where historical data are not available.

The site’s ground water pump-and-treat system continues to operate. EPA plans to issue an ESD to change cleanup activities for ground water contamination and to explain the approach used to address additional source contamination.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRP to investigate and clean up the site. The PRP continues to fund site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
