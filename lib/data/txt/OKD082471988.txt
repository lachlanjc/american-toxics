### Background

**Current Status**

Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing. The first Five-Year Review for the Hudson Refinery Superfund Site (Site) began in April 2014. The site inspection was held May 15, 2014. The purpose of a five-year review is to evaluate the implementation and performance of a remedy in order to determine if the remedy remains protective of human health and the environment. The review was completed February 27, 2015. The remedy was determined to be protective of human health and the environment.

**Site Background**

The 200-acre Hudson Refinery site is located in Payne County, Oklahoma. A refinery operated at the site from 1922 until 1982. The site historically included aboveground storage tanks (ASTs), wastewater treatment impoundments, separators, stained soils, a land treatment unit, and loose and friable asbestos-containing material (ACM). Refinery operations contaminated soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment.

Proposal Date: 4/23/1999  
Final Date: 7/22/1999  

**Location:** The Hudson Refinery site is located in Cushing, Payne County, Oklahoma. Surrounding the site are residential and agricultural lands to the north and commercial properties to the south. Highway 33 (Main Street) separates the site into a “north” and “south” refinery. The “North Refinery” consists of approximately 165 acres, and the “South Refinery” is approximately 35 acres.  

**Population:** There are approximately 8,371 residents in the City of Cushing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. Cleanup of contaminated media at the site will reduce the health and ecological risks associated with remaining contamination.

From September 2002 through June 2003, a non-time-critical removal action by EPA addressed refinery process units and other miscellaneous items, including unlined collection basins, a sump and structurally unsafe buildings. EPA dismantled existing refinery process equipment and structures and removed friable ACM in coordination with decontamination and removal activities.

EPA plans to complete the site’s first five-year review in February 2015. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents.

The site is the location of an abandoned refinery that operated from 1922 to 1982. The area historically included ASTs, wastewater treatment impoundments, separators, stained soils, a land treatment unit, and loose and friable ACM.The site is the location of an abandoned refinery that operated from 1922 to 1982.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy, selected in 2007 and updated in 2010, included removal of ACM, coke tar and scrap metal; soil and waste excavation with off-site disposal; excavation, stabilization and off-site disposal of sediment from waste ponds and sumps; treatment of surface water from ponds with contaminated sediment; use of hydrocarbon belt skimmers for light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL), as needed; groundwater monitoring; and institutional controls. Cleanup construction started in early 2010 and finished in October 2010. Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1999, an EPA removal action included investigation of radiation sources, demolition of structurally unsafe buildings, removal of tetraethyl lead (TEL), ACM abatement and disposal of waste containing hazardous substances. In addition, removal activities included excavation of oil-contaminated soils, removal of product from ASTs, separators and sumps, and construction of a land treatment unit for biotreatment of wastes. Additional removal activities included the dismantling of a hydrofluoric acid alkylation unit, removal of all catwalks from towers and the removal of TEL ASTs.
