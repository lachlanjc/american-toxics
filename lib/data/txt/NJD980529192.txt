### Background

The GEMS Landfill site is located in Gloucester Township, New Jersey, and covers approximately 60 acres. It is located near the intersection of New Brooklyn-Erial and Turnersville-Hickstown Roads, and rises approximately 100 feet above the surrounding terrain. The eastern edge of the landfill is bordered by a stream called Holly Run, which flows into Briar Lake which is located a quarter mile away from the site.  
  
The site was used as a landfill by a series of operators, starting with the Township, which has owned the parcel since the 1950s. Information collected by EPA and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) showed that municipal and industrial wastes were routinely disposed of at the site from 1969 to 1980. The landfill was last operated by Gloucester Environmental Management Services, Inc. (GEMS) until it was closed by NJDEP in 1980.  
  
EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983, and a cleanup plan to address the site contamination was selected in 1985. The majority of the site’s cleanup activities were completed in 2004, and long-term cleanup operation and maintenance (O&M) is ongoing.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1980, NJDEP began testing groundwater from private water wells in the area, as well as surface water from Holly Run and Briar Lake, for the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs are potentially harmful contaminants that can easily evaporate into the air. The sampling confirmed that elevated concentrations of VOCs were present in both the groundwater and surface water. Residents were urged to connect to public water systems and the State restricted installation of new wells in the affected area by establishing a classification exception area (CEA) to prevent new water supply wells from being drilled. In 1983, EPA removed debris from the site and constructed a fence, two culverts, and a berm to prevent residents from coming into contact with wastes at the site and control drainage from the site. The site was placed on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983.

In March 1985, EPA completed a remedial investigation of the nature and extent of contamination at the site. This included investigations to determine groundwater quality, flow and aquifer characteristics; sampling and testing of air, landfill gases, surface water, soil and sediment; and studies of the liquids that percolate through the landfill (leachate). The investigation showed that groundwater, soil, landfill gas, surface water and sediment were contaminated with VOCs and heavy metals, including arsenic, barium and lead. In addition, leachate was found to contain trace concentrations of pesticides.

Based on these results and other findings from the investigation, EPA and NJDEP announced a selected cleanup plan in September 1985, which called mainly for capping of the landfill, and extracting and treating contaminated groundwater. The treated water was to be discharged to either a publicly owned treatment works (POTW) or to Holly Run. This long-term action was subsequently divided into Phases I and II.  
  
Phase I activities began in 1989 and were conducted by the GEMS Trust under an agreement with the state of New Jersey. The activities included regrading the landfill slopes and placing a cap on the landfill; installation of a leachate collection system and an underdrain in Holly Run; construction of a gas collection and treatment system; installation of drainage controls; cleanup of the Holly Run stream and nearby Briar Lake; and the connection of potentially affected residences to the existing municipal water supply system. Work was completed in 1994 and served to substantially reduce the amount of leachate generated and hazards posed by landfill gases.  
  
The GEMS Trust regularly inspected the Phase I remedy to ensure that the fence was maintained, and that there were no issues with the landfill cap and landfill gas collection and treatment system. Improvements and repairs occurred as needed, and NJDEP now continues these activities as part of the long-term O&M of the site.

Phase II of the cleanup plan started in June 1997, when EPA and the state of New Jersey reached a settlement with private parties to pay for past costs associated with the site, and to perform the Phase II activities. This phase consisted of the design and construction of a groundwater extraction and on-site pre-treatment system. During the design, a publicly owned treatment works (POTW), the Camden County Municipal Utilities Authority (CCMUA) wastewater treatment plant, was selected as the discharge option. At the time of construction, the system included a series of eight extraction wells along the northwestern boundary of the landfill to pump contaminated water from the aquifer, and a new pump station and force main to convey collected groundwater from the Holly Run underdrain to the pre-treatment plant. There, the water would undergo physical and chemical treatment for the removal of landfill contaminants. After the final treatment step, the treated groundwater would be pumped to a holding tank where it was to be discharged to the CCMUA for final treatment.  
  
Construction of the GEMS treatment system was completed in April 1999, and startup was scheduled for June 1999. However, prior to startup, the CCMUA issued a cease discharge notice in connection with the potential discharge of radionuclides. A subsequent radionuclide groundwater investigation concluded that radionuclides in groundwater monitoring wells were due to naturally occurring sources. The system eventually began operation in summer 2005 and has been operating since that time. Groundwater monitoring is conducted on a semi-annual basis and reported annually.

Several additional actions were completed and/or are ongoing subsequent to completion of the Phase 2 activities. In 2008, a vapor intrusion study was completed, which indicated that the concentrations of VOCs were below EPA’s groundwater screening concentrations. In 2014, the GEMS Trust installed a deep horizontal well north/northwest of the landfill to better capture the groundwater plume at the downgradient end of the plume. Also in 2014, the GEMS Trust installed five additional off-site sentinel wells to assess the continued appropriateness of the CEA boundary. The GEMS Trust also continued to monitor the swamp pink population, a federally listed threatened and endangered plant species that was identified in the wetlands surrounding the landfill during the initial site investigations.I n 2018, a monitoring study of Swamp Pink was conducted by Amy S. Greene Environmental Consultants, Inc. and the study concluded that “While the Colony III site (i.e. the study population) has been declining since the GEMS Landfill groundwater pumping and treatment system went online (CH2M 2015; Burns & McDonnell 2017), the decline is not believed to be related to implementation of the Remedial Action Work Plan. The overall conclusion is that operations at the GEMS Landfill is not affecting the Swamp Pink population, the NJDEP notified the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on October 26, 2020, and ceased all Swamp Pink monitoring at the site.

EPA's 2014 review of the cleanup plan identified the need for a baseline ecological risk assessment. A screening level ecological risk assessment completed in 2010 concluded that additional site-specific information was needed to fully understand any potential impacts to the ecological community at the site. Potential risks to ecological receptors were evaluated in an Ecological Risk Assessment Step 3 Report March 2015. The report concluded that no further ecological risk assessments are required. Comments on this report from NJDEP and EPA stated that there may be potential risk of arsenic to benthic communities, the animals and plants that live on or in the sediment of Briar Lake, and further sediment sampling is warranted. In January 2017, NJDEP conducted additional sediment sampling. Based on results of this sampling and the report it was concluded that a baseline ecological risk assessment was not required.

Sitewide groundwater monitoring has continued since NJDEP took over O&M operations in 2015.

Potential Site impacts from climate change have been assessed, and the performance of the remedy is currently not at risk due to the expected effects of climate change in the region and near the Site.

The fifthFive Year Review of the site was completed in 2024. It concluded that the remedy is currently protective of human health and the environment, and that monitoring and additional investigation should occur to assure it remains so.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In July, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will install 18 groundwater monitoring wells near and on the GEMS Landfill Superfund site in Gloucester Township, New Jersey. The EPA will use the data collected from this groundwater investigation to determine if the agency’s cleanup remains protective of public health and the environment. As part of the cleanup, the EPA capped the landfill and removed and treated contaminated groundwater. The EPA continues to examine the cleanup system every five years to ensure the site’s cleanup system is capturing all known site related contamination.

The EPA expects the sampling to take two weeks. The work will take place on weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.

The EPA contractors will manage traffic with flaggers at/near Erial Road, Briar Lane, and Primrose Lane during the sampling hours. EPA will share any changes to these routes or other construction related activities that impact traffic or use of local roads, such as road closures, on the site’s website and through the site’s mailing list.

In the 1997 consent decree, EPA and NJDEP approved the GEMS Trust Certification Report indicating that groundwater containment had been achieved within the specific boundaries identified. Therefore, consistent with the consent decree, O&M activities were transferred to NJDEP in July 2015. EPA and NJDEP continue to review data to ensure that the remedy operates as intended.  
  
NJDEP is working with Gloucester Township (with EPA’s assistance) for posting deed notices both on the landfill property and five adjacent residential properties where components of the remedy are located and are within the limits of the CEA established for contaminated groundwater at the site.

### Sampling and Monitoring

EPA is investigating the groundwater at the GEMS Landfill Superfund site to further characterize the site geology, hydrology and extent of groundwater contamination. The activities to be performed include installation of permanent monitoring wells, installation and abandonment of temporary well borings and related sampling. Twelve (12) new wells and thirteen (13) temporary well borings will be installed in the Lower Cohansey and Kirkwood aquifers. The data generated from this investigation will be used by EPA to assess plume capture by the horizontal recovery well, the vertical and horizontal delineation of the groundwater contamination and improve the Conceptual Site Model (CSM). The existing Classification Exception Area will also be revised by EPA, as necessary, with respect to; 1) the list of contaminants, 2) contaminant concentrations; and 3) vertical and horizontal extent of the groundwater contamination. EPA will also use the data collected from this groundwater investigation to determine if the current cleanup system is capturing all known site related contamination.
