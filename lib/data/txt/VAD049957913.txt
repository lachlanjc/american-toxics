Background
The 11-acre C & R Battery Company site is located near the James River in Chesterfield County, Virginia. Between the early 1970s and 1985, C&R Battery Co., Inc. used the site to dismantle batteries from cars, trucks and commercial applications in order to recover lead and lead oxide. The process involved cutting open batteries and draining acid into on-site ponds. These practices contaminated soil, sediment and surface water with lead and other hazardous chemicals. EPA added the site to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in July 1987. EPA deleted the site from the Superfund program’s NPL on August 17, 2022. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. EPA oversaw the PRP’s cleanup of the site contamination. Site cleanup activities included excavation of lead-contaminated soil and sediment, solidification and stabilization of the contaminated soil and sediment; disposal of the stabilized material in a nearby solid waste landfill; site grading; placement of clean topsoil over the entire site and replanting of the site. Soil and sediment cleanup activities took place between 1992 and 1993; there are no releases from the site to groundwater or nearby surface water. The James River wetlands, approximately three miles downstream, were determined to be free of site contaminants. These wetlands are used for recreational purposes. Site groundwater was monitored between 1993 and 2016. In 2017, EPA concluded that the acidity of groundwater at the site is consistent with background conditions and that groundwater monitoring is no longer required. Implementation of land use restrictions ensure the continued protectiveness of the remedy. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent 2023 Five-Year Review (PDF) concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term because, as result of the cleanup, no one is currently exposed to contamination that could pose an unacceptable risk.  Land use restrictions are in place to ensure the remedy remains protective over the long term. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2028. EPA deleted the site from the Superfund program’s NPL on August 17, 2022. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
For the remedy to continue to be protective, land use restrictions are in place so that site owners will be required to take appropriate precautions if any future activities could disturb subsurface soil at the site. Pursuant to the Virginia Uniform Environmental Covenants Act, two environmental covenants for 1306 and 1320 Bellwood Road, respectively, were signed and recorded with the Chesterfield County Recorder of Deeds on February 26, 2021. The environmental covenants eliminate any exposure pathways to potential residual lead contamination in soil and establish safe management practices in the event of excavation. Institutional controls are in place to restrict land use and protect the remedy. Additional information about the institutional controls is available in the 2023 Five-Year Review (PDF) (page 9).

Emergency Response and Removal
Cleanup has included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions in 1986 included mixing soils and pools of acid with lime to reduce acidity; excavating and storing some soil on site; and installing drainage controls, a cap and a fence to restrict direct access to contaminated areas of the site.
