### Background

The 94-acre Cedartown Municipal Landfill [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in Cedartown, Georgia. The site includes the area where a mine and then a municipal landfill operated from the 1880s to 1979.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1989 because of contaminated groundwater, surface water and solid waste resulting from operations at the site.

EPA, the [Georgia Environmental Protection Division (Georgia EPD)](https://epd.georgia.gov/) and the Cedartown Municipal Landfill [Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) Committee, the site’s PRP group, have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site. By inspecting and maintaining the landfill cover, placing institutional controls on the site property, and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, Georgia EPD and the site’s PRPs continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s PRPs led site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with EPA and Georgia EPD.

**1994 – 1998**  
1994 to 1998, the site’s PRPs completed landfill cover and seep inspections.

1995 to 1997, the PRPs conducted groundwater monitoring.

In 1996, the City of Cedartown annexed the landfill area properties and placed institutional controls on them. A city ordinance restricts the installation of wells.

**1998**  
EPA updated the remedy to remove the implementation of a second remedy from the site’s long-term groundwater remedy.

**1999**  
EPA removed the site from the NPL.

**2006**  
Groundwater was sampled as part of the second Five-Year Review.

**2011**  
The 2011 FYR, concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires restoration of the landfill cover and subsequent maintenance and inspections.

**2016**  
EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews (FYR) of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents.

EPA completed the [fourth Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11050366) in 2016.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [forth Five Year Review](http://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11050366.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2016. The remedy at the Site currently protects human health and the environment because there is no evidence of exposure.

The City of Cedartown is responsible for inspecting the landfill cover semi-annually and performing maintenance to ensure its integrity as required.

Groundwater and surface water at the site were sampled in 2016 as part of the fourth Five-Year Review (FYR). The fourth FYR found that the remedy remains protective of human health/environment and recommended regular inspection and maintenance of the landfill cover.

The fourth FYR also recommended an evaluation of deed notices for three additional land parcels that may be within the landfill boundary. As of March 2018, a re-evaluation of EPA's aerial photography is being conducted as part of this evaluation.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRPs to investigate and clean up the site. The PRPs funded site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
