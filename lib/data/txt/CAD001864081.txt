Background
The 75-acre Westinghouse Electric Corporation (Sunnyvale Plant) site is the former location of an electrical transformer manufacturing facility. Manufacturing of steam generators, marine propulsion systems and missile launching systems for the Department of Defense (DoD) currently takes place on the site. Groundwater contamination resulted from a storage tank leaking polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and from localized spills. Following initial actions to protect human health and the environment, the site’s long-term cleanup is ongoing.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal and PRP actions.EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that EPA could not make a protectiveness determination until it assesses potential vapor intrusion pathways. The review noted that some surface soils at the site contain contamination above cleanup levels and that institutional controls to prevent exposure to contaminated soils or groundwater are not yet in place.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The removal of contaminated soil and a gasoline tank, and the operation of the groundwater treatment system reduced the potential for exposure to contaminated materials at the site.Initial Actions: The potentially responsible party (PRP) removed contaminated soils in 1984 and 1985, and a gasoline tank in 1986.Entire Site: The long-term remedy included extracting and treating groundwater, incinerating soil contaminants off site, and implementing land use restrictions at the site. Under EPA supervision, the PRP completed groundwater and soil cleanup plans in 1994. Construction of the remedies began in 1994. Removal of soils in the main plant areas and the underground storage tank area occurred in late 1994. Full-scale treatment of contaminated groundwater began in early 1995. Groundwater treatment will continue until the groundwater meets established cleanup goals.
