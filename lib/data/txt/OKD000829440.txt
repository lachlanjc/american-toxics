### Background

The National Zinc Company site operated a zinc smelter on this site from 1907 to 1976. The Site began operations primarily to recover metals such as zinc, cadmium, and lead from industrial materials.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Approximately 1,000 residential properties contaminated with heavy metals were remediated thereby protecting residents for lead exposure. Cleaning up the soils in the residential areas significantly lowered the overall blood lead levels in the community. This is supported by blood lead level testing results.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA implemented a removal action and cleanup of soil near the active smelter facility in 1992. The Site was proposed to the National Priorities List (NPL) and later designated as a Superfund Accelerated Cleanup Model (SACM) pilot project in 1993. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed by the EPA and Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) on March 31, 1994 that allowed the Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) pilot project to proceed, with the purpose of ensuring a prompt CERCLA-Quality Cleanup. By September 2001, all remediation work has been substantially completed by the under State, ODEQ. ODEQ completed the first Five-Year Remedy Review on October 25, 2001 and found the remedy protective of public health and the environment. ODEQ completed the second Five-Year Remedy Review on November 22, 2006 and a third Five-Year Remedy Review on November 21, 2011. Again, the implemented remedy was found protective of public health and the environment. A fourth Five-Year Remedy Review was completed on October 18, 2016 by the ODEQ. The next review will be conducted in 2021.
