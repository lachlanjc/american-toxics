### Background

The 470-acre Sharon Steel Corp. (Midvale Tailings) site is in Midvale, Utah. From 1906 to 1971, a smelting and ore milling facility produced lead, copper, zinc and other metals at the site. In 1982, the Utah Department of Environmental Quality became involved at the site when it learned that nearby residents were gathering tailings for use in gardens and children's sandboxes. The State tested residents’ gardens and sandboxes and found high levels of lead. The U.S. Geological Survey tested the groundwater and found high levels of arsenic. Facility activities and waste management practices at the site had contaminated air, soil, surface water and groundwater with heavy metals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in 2004.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being cleaned up by the state and the federal government.

The EPA has done several five-year reviews of the site’s cleanup. These reviews make sure that the cleanup protects public health and the environment. The reviews also make sure that the cleanup was done according to the plans made by the EPA and the state.

EPA divided the site into two separate areas, or operable units (OUs), to better address contamination. OU1 covers 270 undeveloped acres and includes a capped, 10-million-cubic-yard waste tailings pile. OU2 covers about 200 acres and includes 600 residential and commercial properties.

The site’s long-term plan for OU1 included:

- digging up and moving the tailings
- removing the surface soil in the mill building area and replacing with clean soil
- dredging of contaminated wetland sediments
- restoring wetlands
- constructing and vegetating a soil cap over the tailings pile
- digging a trench along the eastern edge of the tailings pile
- monitoring groundwater
- following new rules to make sure the cleanup is not disturbed or damaged

The site’s long-term remedy for OU2 included:

- removing contaminated soil from residential areas
- disposing of the excavated soil at the OU1 tailings pile
- adding clean soil to the excavated areas
- site monitoring
- testing and cleaning home interiors following soil cleanup
- removing and replacing trees and shrubs affected by excavation activities

Remedy construction took place between 1991 and 1999.

Site cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups. These cleanups were done to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions included construction of a fence around the site to restrict access, removal and disposal of chemicals, asbestos inventory and demolition of mill facilities.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Based on the January 2024 [Updated Lead Guidance](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/updated-soil-lead-guidance-cercla-sites-and-rcra-corrective-action-facilities), the EPA is evaluating the risks from lead in soils to sensitive populations. This analysis will include compiling available site data to determine the potential presence and extent of lead-contaminated soils. Lead can pose health risks to sensitive populations, especially children under 7 years old and pregnant or nursing women. The process to implement the Updated Lead Guidance will involve additional planning, data gathering, risk assessment and funding requests. EPA will coordinate with our state partners and request public feedback on our proposed cleanup plans before additional cleanups begin if it is determined that additional cleanup is needed.

While implementing the Updated Lead Guidance may take up to three years to complete, the EPA and Utah Department of Environmental Quality will share information on planned activities and results as they become available. In the meantime, and out of an abundance of caution, if you live near the Sharon Steel Superfund Site, the EPA recommends you have your children tested for lead annually; especially those under 7 and if the soil at your property was not replaced previously. Additionally, you can take some simple actions to limit exposure to potential lead contamination in soils, including:

- Maintaining yards and other soil cover;
- Washing hands, especially children’s, after handling soil, playing outside, and before meals;
- Making sure children eat nutritious meals high in iron and calcium;
- Keeping dust levels down by mopping and damp dusting regularly;
- Regularly changing out furnace filters;
- Keeping kids’ toys and play areas clean;
- Taking shoes off at the door and keeping pets clean;
- Wearing gloves while gardening; and
- Cleaning homegrown produce and peeling root vegetables.

The EPA Sharon Steel Superfund Site team will communicate with residents affected by this guidance about the specific next steps the Agency will take in their community. Residents may also contact the site’s Community Involvement Coordinator with questions or concerns at ( [haniewicz.missy@epa.gov](mailto:haniewicz.missy@epa.gov?subject=Sharon%20Steel%20Corp.%20\(Midvale%20Tailings\)%20site) ) or 720-415-4609.
