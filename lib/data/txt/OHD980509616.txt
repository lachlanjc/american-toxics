### Background

The 12-acre Bowers Landfill site is located in Circleville, Ohio. The area was originally a pit for gravel excavations, and later used as a landfill from 1958 to 1968. Between 1963 and 1968, in addition to general domestic and industrial waste, the Site received chemical wastes originating from local industries, including E.I. DuPont deNemours & Company (DuPont) and Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Inc. (now PPG Industries, Inc.). Facility operations contaminated soil, sediment, surface water and groundwater with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1997. Monitoring activities are ongoing.

The current owner of the Site is CODB Hunt Club, which currently uses it for recreational purposes. The surrounding area is rural, with some residences, and ponds/ to the east. The Scioto River is west of the Site and is used for recreation such as boating, fishing, and swimming. The landfill has been capped and the Site is partially fenced, with posted warning signs. The groundwater underlying the site flows toward and discharges to the Scioto River. No drinking water wells are located between the landfill and the river. Anticipated future land use for the Site and surrounding areas will most likely be similar to the current residential and recreational use.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

The site’s long-term remedy included:

- removing surface debris and vegetation from the landfill,
- installing a 4-foot-thick clay and soil cap on the landfill top and side slopes,
- instituting erosion control and drainage improvements,
- installation of a landfill gas venting system,
- fencing the Site perimeter,
- restricting Site use, and
- conducting long-term groundwater monitoring.

Construction of the remedy finished in 1992. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1997. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Long-term protectiveness requires updating the site’s environmental covenants to allow for light recreational uses on site.
