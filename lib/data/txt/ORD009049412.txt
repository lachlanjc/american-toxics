### Background

The 83-acre Union Pacific Railroad Co. Tie-Treating Plant site is located in The Dalles, Oregon. Union Pacific owned the wood treatment facility from 1926 until late 1987, when equipment and structures were purchased by Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation. The plant primarily treated railroad ties for Union Pacific, but also treated wood for other commercial users across the United States. From 1959 to 1987, J. H. Baxter Co. operated the plant for Union Pacific. The facility treated wood with copper arsenate, creosote, a creosote/fuel mixture and pentachlorophenol (PCP). Spills of treatment solutions and wastewater ponds in use were the main sources of soil and groundwater contamination. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

The site consists of an active wood-treating area that is currently operated by Amerities West, LLC; the undeveloped portion of Riverfront Park; and a small area of Columbia River sediment next to the undeveloped portion of Riverfront Park in The Dalles, Oregon. The plant is located 500 feet south of the Columbia River and is bounded by Riverfront Park, The Dalles levee and Interstate 84 to the north; the site’s rail yard to the south; Three Mile Creek and undeveloped land to the east; and a residence and access road to the west.

The plant site is generally flat, bounded by a steep bluff to the south and The Dalles levee and the Interstate 84 causeway to the north. The plant’s main office and all wood-treating facilities are located near the western end of the plant site. The eastern half has been used for storage of treated and untreated wood railroad cross ties. Groundwater is used by over 11,000 people located within three miles of the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

ODEQ has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by ODEQ and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) is the lead regulatory agency overseeing the investigation and cleanup of the site.

ODEQ selected the site’s long-term remedy in 1996 for groundwater, soil, surface water and sediment. Groundwater cleanup included product removal, hydraulic containment, groundwater extraction and treatment, permitted discharge of treated effluent, and surface drainage controls. In addition, the plan included institutional controls and monitoring. The soil portion of the remedy included in-place bioremediation and bioventing; deferred investigation of contaminated areas currently inaccessible; and institutional controls. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. The remedy for surface water and sediment included no further action and monitoring.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included short-term actions to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. A removal action in 1992 disposed of contaminated soils. A multi-layered cap constructed in 1995 covers 1 acre of contaminated sediments.
