### Background

The 87-acre Pijak Farm site is located in Plumsted Township, New Jersey. From 1963 to 1970, drums and free-flowing liquids from a facility disposing of specialty and research chemicals were dumped into a natural ditch that ran through the site. Later, they were covered with soil. There were about 3,740 drums on the site. The deteriorated remains of drums were visible along the edge of the floodplain. In 1980, the State of New Jersey found that groundwater was contaminated with organic chemicals. After additional investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983. Dumping activities contaminated groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Groundwater is the only source of drinking water near the site. Pijak Farm is one of four Superfund sites, including the Spence, Hopkins and Goose Farm sites, within a two-mile radius. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in March 1997.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Based on the results of the site investigation, EPA selected the site’s remedy in the site’s 1984 Record of Decision, or ROD. It included: (1) removal and off-site disposal of all drums and lab packs at a federally approved disposal facility; (2) excavation and off-site disposal of visibly contaminated soil at a federally approved disposal facility; (3) pumping and removal of contaminated groundwater, as necessary, during excavation; (4) monitoring of on-site wells annually for a five-year period; and (5) sediment control during excavation and sampling efforts.

Morton International, the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP), completed the removal and off-site disposal of contaminated drums, lab packs and visibly contaminated soil, eliminating risks posed by exposure to these materials. Follow-up soil sampling indicated the presence of residual contamination in soil at the site. Between 1989 and 1994, the PRP dug up about 4,000 cubic yards of waste material and contaminated soil and disposed of it off site. The site was subsequently determined to be clean and was removed from EPA's National Priorities List in March 1997.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

After cleanup actions by the PRP, EPA removed the site from the National Priorities List in March 1997.
