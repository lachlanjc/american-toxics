### Background

The 11-acre Old Southington Landfill (Site) is located in Southington, Connecticut. The Site abuts Old Turnpike Road to the west, Rejean Road to the north, Black Pond to the east, and commercial properties to the south. Immediately north of the Site lies a residential development. To the west exist commercial properties including a radio station and an auto salvage yard.

The Site operated as a co-disposal municipal landfill between 1920 and 1967. The northern portion of the landfill was known as a “stump dump” because it received primarily construction debris. The southern portion received both municipal and industrial waste from various contributors throughout New England including Solvents Recovery Service of New England that is also in Southington. Between 1973 and 1980, the landfill was subdivided and sold for residential and commercial development. Four homes were built on the northern end of the landfill which was zoned residential and six businesses were built on the southern end which was zoned commercial. The Site is located approximately 700 feet southeast of the former municipal Well No. 5 that was installed in 1971 as a public water supply. In 1979, the municipal well was closed because groundwater analyses conducted by the State Department of Public Health indicated the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at levels exceeding state standards. EPA followed with a Preliminary Assessment that resulted in the Site being added to the National Priorities List (NPL) of Superfund Sites in 1984.

From 1987 through 1993, a Remedial Investigation was performed by the Site’s responsible parties, with EPA and State oversight, to determine the nature and extent of contamination. A Human Health and Ecological Risk Assessment including a fish tissue study from Black Pond was performed to evaluate potential risks to human health and the environment. A Feasibility Study followed to assess viable remedial alternatives to address potential human and ecological risk. In 1994, the first Record of Decision (ROD) for an Interim Source Control Remedy was selected. This remedy addressed the landfill area itself, and was selected to prevent contact with landfill waste. The Source Control Remedy (i.e., capping) was completed in 2001. This remedy also required that additional groundwater studies be performed to determine extent of groundwater plume emanating from the landfill to determine if there were any adverse impacts to human health or to downgradient natural resource areas.

From approximately 1996 through 2006, a Supplemental Groundwater Investigation was conducted. A respective Human Health Risk Assessment and Feasibility Study followed, and in 2006 a second ROD was issued for a final groundwater remedy to address vapor intrusion potentially migrating to properties downgradient of the landfill. This remedy also consisted of implementing institutional controls (ICs) at two properties immediately across the street and downgradient from the landfill.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

All remedial components from both the 1994 and 2006 RODs have been fully implemented which consists of: permanent relocation of all on-site homes and commercial buildings; excavation and consolidation of a hot spot area into a lined cell underneath the cap; capping the northern portion of the landfill with a single-layer low permeability cap and the southern portion of the landfill with a double-layer low permeability cap due to the more highly contaminated material; installation of a gas vent system; development of the northern portion of the landfill as a passive recreational park; performance of operation and maintenance of the caps with all appurtenances; performance of long-term monitoring; conducting five-year reviews; and implementation of ICs in the form of environmental land use restrictions at the landfill and at two properties downgradient of the Site. Although not required by either ROD, the Site’s responsible parties installed an impermeable gas barrier below the cap and along the northern boundary of the landfill as a precautionary measure to prevent potential landfill gas from migrating to nearby residences.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

All remedial activities at the Old Southington Landfill Site are complete and the Site poses no unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. The Site was deleted from the NPL on September 12, 2018. However, operation and maintenance of the landfill cap, including all appurtenances, and long-term groundwater monitoring will continue to be performed by the Site’s responsible parties. EPA, in consultation with the State, will continue to conduct Five-Year Reviews to assure that the remedy remains effective and protective of human health and the environment.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**

This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site. The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above.

Institutional controls (i.e., restrictions) have been placed on properties that comprise the landfill to prevent consumption of groundwater and prevent activities that would compromise the integrity of the landfill cap. Institutional controls have also been placed at two properties located downgradient of the landfill to restrict construction of structures over contaminated groundwater that exceed state groundwater standards to prevent exposure to vapor intrusion. These institutional controls address the requirements of both the 1994 and 2006 RODs.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
