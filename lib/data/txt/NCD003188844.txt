### Background

The 5-acre Carolina Transformer Company [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) Site is located in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The Site includes an area where the Carolina Transformer Company (CTC) operated a rebuilding and repair facility from 1967 to 1982.

THe EPA placed the Site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1987 because of contaminated debris, groundwater, sediment and soil resulting from facility operations.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the Site. A water line connects nearby residences to the public water supply. By monitoring groundwater and conducting required Five-Year Reviews, the EPA and the [North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ)](https://deq.nc.gov/) continue to protect people and the environment from Site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The EPA leads Site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with NCDEQ.

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment.

**1984**  
The EPA dug up 975 tons of contaminated soil, moved the soil to an off-site facility and placed a fence around the area. Additionally, nearby residences were connected to the public water supply.

**1996**  
The EPA built the groundwater pump-and-treat system and the system to remove contamination from soil and sediment.

**1999**  
The EPA began use of the systems and cleanup activities.

**2003**  
The EPA completed debris, sediment and soil cleanup.

**2005**  
The groundwater treatment system operated until 2005 when the EPA began monitored natural attenuation.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [third Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11155230) was published by the EPA HQs in 2020**.** The remedy at the Carolina Transformer Site currently protects human health and the environment because although contamination remains in Site groundwater above remediation goals, no receptors are being exposed to that contaminated groundwater.

Physical site cleanup activites were completed in 2003. NCDEQ continues to conduct annual ground water monitoring.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The current owner of the Site placed restrictions (institutional controls) on the Site property that require coordination with the EPA before ground disturbing activity, and prohibiting interference with monitoring wells onsite.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Periodic groundwater monitoring was conducted by the EPA to evaluate achievement of remedial goals onsite, and that work has since been taken over by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ). All Site related contaminants except manganese are now within cleanup goals.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA used federal funds for cleanup activities. EPA continues to use federal funds for monitoring activities.
