Background
The site is located in the city of Grand Prairie, a western suburb of Dallas, Texas. The former Delfasco Forge facility operated as a munitions manufacturing and forge operation since the 1950s. The facility ceased operations in 1998. The source of contamination is the soil and groundwater contaminated with chlorinated solvents. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) program conducted a vapor intrusion investigation of the neighborhood in 2008, sampling sub-slabs, crawl spaces and indoor air in 16 homes and two commercial structures. Ten of the 18 structures had measurable levels of trichloroethylene (TCE) in indoor air. In July 2008, owners of Delfasco Forge filed for bankruptcy. In November 2008, mitigation systems were installed at the four homes with the highest TCE vapor concentrations under the Superfund Removal program. The EPA received money under the bankruptcy settlement to conduct vapor mitigation work. The EPA RCRA program used the bankruptcy funds to offer presumptive mitigation systems to approximately 80 residential homes living above the plume. Thirty-one of those residents accepted mitigation systems and the systems were installed in 2014. The EPA conducted pre- and post-mitigation sampling.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The Superfund removal program installed four vapor mitigation systems in 2008. An additional 31 homes received vapor mitigation systems in 2014 utilizing funds from the bankruptcy settlement.

Sampling and Monitoring
EPA has conducted groundwater sampling events 6 times from 2023 - 2024. Some sampling events have included indoor air and soil gas sampling.
