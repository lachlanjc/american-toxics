### Background

The 450-acre Eureka Mills site is part of Utah’s historic Tintic Mining District, located in the East Tintic Mountains. This is about 80 miles southwest of Salt Lake City in Juab County, Utah.

Eureka was founded in 1870, following discovery of silver, lead, gold, copper and arsenic in the area. This was extensively mined until 1958. Large waste rock piles and waste material from mining was left mostly on the south side of the valley, next to homes and businesses. Transport along rail lines, milling operations and use of mine waste for urban construction spread mine waste throughout the town.

The site includes the residential and commercial parts of Eureka and some neighboring areas outside of the city limits. The State of Utah discovered contamination at the site during an inspection in July 2000. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing at the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being cleaned up by the federal and state governments and private companies, called potentially responsible parties.

The EPA has done several five-year reviews at the site. These reviews make sure that the cleanups protect public health and the environment. The reviews also make sure that the cleanup was done and works according to the plans.

The most recent review found that the cleanup at the site was done and is working according to the EPA’s plan. The cleanup is protecting human health and the environment in the short-term. The review also found that the EPA needs to create easements at OU3. Additionally, operation and maintenance issues need to be addressed.

The EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List on September 5, 2002. After the cleanup was finished, the site was deleted from the National Priorities List on September 25, 2018.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Based on the January 2024 Updated Lead Guidance, the EPA is evaluating the risks from lead in soils to sensitive populations. This analysis will include compiling available site data to determine the potential presence and extent of lead-contaminated soils.

Lead can pose health risks to sensitive populations, especially children under 7 years old and pregnant or nursing women. The process to implement the Updated Lead Guidance will involve additional planning, data gathering, risk assessment and funding requests. The EPA will coordinate with our state partners and request public feedback on our proposed cleanup plans before additional cleanups begin.

While implementing the Updated Lead Guidance may take several years to complete, the EPA and Utah Department of Environmental Quality will share information on planned activities and results as they become available.

In the meantime, and out of an abundance of caution, if you live near the Eureka Superfund Site, the EPA recommends you have your children tested for lead annually; especially those under 7 and if the soil at your property was not replaced previously. Additionally, you can take some simple actions to limit exposure to potential lead contamination in soils, including:

- Maintaining yards and other soil cover;
- Washing hands, especially children’s, after handling soil, playing outside, and before meals;
- Making sure children eat nutritious meals high in iron and calcium;
- Keeping dust levels down by mopping and damp dusting regularly;
- Regularly changing out furnace filters;
- Keeping kids’ toys and play areas clean;
- Taking shoes off at the door and keeping pets clean;
- Wearing gloves while gardening; and
- Cleaning homegrown produce and peeling root vegetables.

The EPA Eureka Superfund Site team will communicate with residents affected by this guidance about the specific next steps the Agency will take in their community. Residents may also contact the site’s Community Involvement Coordinator with questions or concerns at haniewicz.missy@epa.gov or 720-415-4609.

The site consists of five areas, referred to by EPA as operable units (OUs).

- OU0 is sitewide and includes residential areas.
- OU1 addresses May Day – Godiva Shaft and Tunnel.
- OU2 addresses Bullion Beck – Gemini Mine Waste Piles.
- OU3 addresses Central Eureka Mining Areas (Chief Consolidated Mining Company).
- OU4 addresses site groundwater, surface water and ecological risks within undeveloped areas of the site.

The site’s long-term cleanup included:

- grading and capping of mine waste piles
- excavating lead contaminated soils in residential areas with replacement of 18 inches of soil cover
- rules and structures called “institutional controls”
- implementing public health actions until the remedy is in place

Construction work for the mine waste piles and residential areas cleanup was finished in 2010. About 700 residential and commercial properties were cleaned. In September 2011, EPA found that no further action was required for groundwater, surface water and ecological risk.

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. The EPA finished soil removal actions in 2001 and 2002. These were done because the EPA found high concentrations of lead and arsenic in soil and elevated blood-lead levels in children in Eureka.
