### Background

The North Shore Drive site is located in Elkhart County, Indiana. The approximately 70-acre site is bounded by the St. Joseph River to the south, Old U.S. 20 to the north, Sheridan Blvd. to the east, and Corwin Drive to the west. There are 47 residences and a few commercial establishments on the site.

Contamination at the site was initially discovered in 1996, when a concerned citizen contacted the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with complaints of skin irritation caused by water drawn from a private residential well. IDEM obtained 19 drinking water samples from residential wells and six subsurface soil samples from nearby properties. Volatile organic compounds, including tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene and dichloroethylene were found in the residential well samples. In five homes, contaminants exceeded the Safe Drinking Water Act Maximum Contaminant Levels. IDEM currently provides point-of-entry carbon filters to the residential homes with wells that had contamination approaching or exceeding the MCLs. While investigations have identified some potential sources of contamination, the origin of the contaminants has not been determined.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Since 2017, EPA has collected numerous samples to define the nature and extent of contamination from volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, at the site. EPA took water samples from 43 residential properties located above the groundwater contamination to determine whether additional private wells were impacted.

EPA conducted additional groundwater sampling to better understand the groundwater plume and to identify potential sources of contamination. EPA also conducted a vapor intrusion study to determine if VOCs were entering indoor spaces through groundwater and soil gas pathways. During the vapor intrusion assessment, soil gas, indoor air, sub-slab, and ambient air samples were collected.

IDEM currently provides point-of-use carbon filters to the residential homes with wells that had contamination approaching or exceeding the maximum contaminant levels (MCL). While investigations have identified some potential sources of contamination, the origin of the contaminants has not been determined.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is continuing the remedial investigation at the site. EPA contractors will be on-site in the coming months to complete the final stage of investigations with additional soil, water, and vapor sampling, with a focus on understanding the sources of contamination.

Once the remedial investigation is complete, EPA will move on to the feasibility study phase of the Superfund cleanup process. During the feasibility study, the agency will evaluate potential alternatives to clean up the groundwater and any other contamination found at the site.

### Sampling and Monitoring

IDEM sampled drinking wells from 43 residences in the area and found 12 contaminated residential wells, five of which exceeded the MCL.
