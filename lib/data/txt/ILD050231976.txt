Background
The Circle Smelting Corporation plant in Beckemeyer, Illinois originally operated as a primary zinc smelter in 1904 to 1994. Beginning in the 1920's, lead-contaminated smelter waste materials, including slag, cinders, dust and debris, from the plant's smelters were disposed throughout the 28-acre site. Lead-contaminated smelter waste materials were also used widely within the Village of Beckemeyer as a surface cover material for walking paths, driveways, and alleys. It is estimated that approximately 10,000 cubic yards contaminated materials, including lead, zinc, cadmium, copper, and arsenic were deposited throughout the Village of Beckemeyer. 
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency became involved with the Circle Smelting Site in 1986 when a fire broke out at the facility, resulting in the evacuation of several local residents. IEPA conducted sampling onsite and in wetlands and residential areas near the site and detected lead levels that exceeded federal standards. In 1993, the site was referred to U.S.  EPA. The sampling results from U.S. EPA’s investigations confirmed the high lead levels detected in previous studies. Three source areas for the metal contamination have been identified: the plant, cinders from the site used as fill material in Beckemeyer, and materials deposited in the drainage ways through surface water runoff north of Old U.S. Highway 50. U.S. EPA cleaned up over 300 properties. An additional 173 properties were sampled but did not need remediation. U.S. EPA also removed 20,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil from the smelter property. U.S. EPA consolidated and placed contaminated soil that was removed from the smelter property, the village, and adjacent wetlands under a concrete cover. The site was proposed to the National Priorities List, a list of the country’s most hazardous sites. However, the site was not listed.
What Is the Current Site Status?
Site cleanup is ongoing. Removal and remedial actions were performed at various times between 1986 and 2010.  EPA is currently evaluating next steps towards completing any remediation work at the Site.
Emergency Response and Removal
In 1994, U.S. EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order for the responsible parties to conduct time-critical sampling and cleanup of the lead-contaminated soil at the site. From 1998 – 2000, contractors for the responsible parties began sampling residential properties to determine the extent of contamination throughout the Village of Beckemeyer. In 2001, approximately 35,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil was removed from affected areas of residential yards and moved to the former facility. In 2002, U.S. EPA took over cleanup at the site and conducted another time-critical removal action. During this removal action, U.S. EPA excavated property owned by Village of Beckemeyer. U.S. EPA also created a raised barrier around the smelter area and pumped water from a water collection area on the southern portion of the site to the sedimentation pond.
