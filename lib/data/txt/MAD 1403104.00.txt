### Background

The Olin Chemical Superfund Site (Site) is comprised of the 53-acre property at 51 Eames Street in Wilmington, Massachusetts (Olin Property or Property) and adjoining off-Property areas that have been impacted by contaminant releases from manufacturing and waste disposal activities formerly conducted at the Property. A chemical manufacturing facility (Facility) was located within the 30-acre northern portion of the Property, which made specialty chemicals for the rubber and plastics industry from 1953 until it closed down in 1986. The Facility was owned and operated by several different corporate entities over time, including National Polychemicals, Inc., American Biltrite Rubber Company, Fisons Limited, and Fisons Corporation (later known as NOR-AM Agro LLC), Stepan Chemical, and Olin Corporation (Olin). Olin purchased the Property in 1980 and operated the Facility until 1986, when the Facility was closed. During the Facility's operation, wastes were released to the environment, including from disposal on the Property in unlined and leaking lagoons and due to spills and other releases. These discharges resulted in groundwater contamination both on and off the Property. In late 2002 and 2003, the Town of Wilmington placed its drinking water supply wells in the Maple Meadow Brook aquifer - located downgradient of the Property - off-line due to detections of n-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a primary Contaminant of Concern (COC) associated with the Site. The Site was finalized on the National Priorities List in April 2006.

EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) with three of the owner/operators in July 2007 to undertake a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) with EPA oversight. The AOC established three Operable Units (OUs) for the RI/FS as follows:

OU1: Soil, sediment and surface water at the Olin Property, including the former facility area, the established conservation area, the on-Property ditch system, the Calcium Sulfate Landfill, and the Slurry Wall Containment Area.

OU2: Off-Property surface water and sediment areas, including the off-Property East Ditch, a small portion of the South Ditch, the off-Property West Ditch, portions of the Maple Meadow Brook Wetland, Landfill Brook and North Pond.

OU3: All on- and off-Property groundwater areas including Maple Meadow Brook Aquifer, groundwater beneath the Olin Property, and groundwater located south and east of the Olin Property. OU3 includes regular monitoring of private water wells. Soils located within the water table are also evaluated under OU3.

EPA has completed the RI/FS for OU1 and OU2 and developed an RI/FS for an interim remedy for OU3 (see below). The RI/FS for OU3 is still ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

From 1986 to 2006, Olin Corporation, a PRP, conducted work under the oversight of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) to address wastes on-site, including excavation of the former waste lagoons, excavation of drums and other bulk wastes, construction of a slurry wall around the former waste pits, excavation of Lake Poly and other hot spots, operation of a pump and treat system for Plant B, and capping of the Calcium Sulfate Landfill. EPA added the Site to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in April 2006 with state support.

In 2007, EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) with Olin Corporation and other previous owners/operators of the Site. Under the terms of the AOC, the PRPs have been conducting a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) with EPA oversight.

Regular monitoring of area private wells is ongoing to confirm that contaminant levels are protective. A field-scale extraction pump test was conducted, which has demonstrated the feasibility of removing DAPL that is pooled on top of bedrock. To date, more than one million gallons of DAPL has been removed from the DAPL pool known as the “Jewel Drive DAPL pool.”

Field studies conducted between 2009 and 2013 involved nearly 80 soil borings; sampling more than 200 monitoring wells and adding about a dozen more wells for sampling; collecting surface water and sediment samples from various water bodies on- and off-site; operating a groundwater treatment system; and monitoring the slurry wall containment area. These findings were summarized in an RI Report for OU1 and OU2 that was finalized in July 2015 (2015 OU1/OU2 RI Report).

Groundwater field studies conducted between 2009 and 2017 involved installation and monitoring of 30 additional groundwater monitoring wells to assist in better defining the nature and extent of impacts in groundwater; replacement of previously damaged wells; installation of wells as part of the construction of a pilot DAPL extraction system (which began operation in November 2012), which demonstrated the feasibility of pumping out DAPL that has pooled on top of bedrock; borehole geophysical logging and acoustic and optical televiewer logging in select well installations to better characterize the nature of the bedrock formation; groundwater monitoring at more than 125 wells; several rounds of synoptic water level measurements across the Site; testing of the integrity of the slurry wall via Hydraulic Pulse Interference Testing (HBIT); collection of additional borings in the Main Street DAPL pool; private water supply monitoring; and vapor intrusion evaluations. The findings were summarized in a draft Remedial Investigation Report for OU3 that was prepared in June 2019 (Draft 2019 OU3 RI Report).

The 2015 OU1/OU2 Report and the Draft 2019 OU3 RI Report (see below), together with subsequent EPA analyses, have concluded that the Site contains residual contamination that could result in unacceptable human health risks:

• Trimethylpentenes (TMPs) in soil could result in unacceptable ingestion, dermal contact, and inhalation risks to construction workers and unacceptable vapor intrusion risks to indoor workers if commercial/industrial-type buildings were to be constructed and occupied on the Olin property.

• Bis-2-ethylhexylphthalates (BEHP) in soil could result in unacceptable risks to construction workers through incidental ingestion and dermal contact.

• Metals and benzo(a)pyrene in soil could result in unacceptable risks to residents through ingestion, dermal contact, and inhalation if a residential development were to be constructed on the Olin property.

• Dense Aqueous-Phase Liquid (DAPL) in the aquifer and groundwater hot spots (highly contaminated groundwater containing n-nitrosodimethylamine \[NDMA\]) could result in unacceptable risks to residents through ingestion if drinking water wells were to be installed in the contaminant plume.

• Benzo(a)pyrene in surface water and sediments could result in unacceptable risks to trespassers through dermal contact in Off-Property West Ditch Stream, located adjacent to the western edge of the Olin property.

In addition, the following ecological risks have been documented:

• BEHP and chromium in upland soil, wetland soil, and sediments could result in adverse ecological impacts.

• Chromium and ammonia in wetland soil, sediments, and surface water could result in adverse ecological impacts.

The Draft 2019 OU3 RI Report that confirms that Site-related chemicals, most notably NDMA, chromium, and ammonia, continue to impact groundwater throughout the study area. The highest concentrations of these chemicals are found in the DAPL material, which has pooled on top of bedrock. NDMA has also been found in nearby private drinking water supply wells at low concentrations. These wells are tested quarterly to confirm that levels of NDMA are protective.

In March 2020, EPA approved the PRPs’ commencement of the first phase of investigation under the August 2019 Data Gaps Work Plan (DGWP). The DGWP is an investigatory effort designed to close remaining data gaps in groundwater and bedrock to facilitate the identification of a final cleanup action for groundwater.

Olin began full implementation of Phase 1A of the DGWP in May 2021, completing data collection activities for this phase in late August 2021. Phase 1A included geophysical investigations (at the ground surface) designed to improve the understanding of the bedrock surface underlying portions of the Site, both on- and off-Olin Property. Olin completed data collection activities for Phase 1B of the DGWP in December 2022, which included the advancement of soil and rock borings (into the subsurface) within the same study areas covered by Phase 1A. The Phase 1B drilling program was designed to confirm the depth and geometry of the bedrock surface for the ongoing groundwater investigations.

Data collection for Phase 2 of the DGWP took place between September 2023 and February 2024, and included monitoring well installation, downhole geophysical logging, and bedrock packer sampling. Results from Phase 2 of the DGWP are expected to be reported to EPA and MassDEP by the end of 2024.

Data generated by Phase 1A, Phase 1B, and Phase 2 of the DGWP investigation will support the design of EPA’s interim remedial action to remove DAPL and highly contaminated groundwater from the overburden aquifer.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

On March 30, 2021 EPA approved a decision on a cleanup remedy for the Olin Chemical Superfund Site (Site) in Wilmington, Mass. The plan, contained in a “Record of Decision” (ROD), provides interim actions to remove ongoing sources of contamination in groundwater and final cleanup actions for addressing contaminated soil, sediments, and surface water at the Site.

Highlights of the cleanup remedy are as follows:

\- Begin cleanup of the aquifer by constructing and operating new groundwater extraction and treatment systems to remove DAPL and highly contaminated groundwater.

\- Capture and treat oily waste and contaminated groundwater that flows into surface water by constructing and operating new multi-phase extraction and treatment systems.

\- Construct and maintain caps and cover systems on areas of soil contamination, including an impermeable cap over the feature on the Olin property known as the “Containment Area.”

\- Excavate contaminated wetland soil and sediment, dispose excavated materials off-site at an appropriate approved facility, and restore impacted wetlands and floodplains.

\- Prevent potential exposure to contaminants that pose inhalation risks in future buildings by requiring additional evaluations and/or engineering controls such as vapor barriers or venting systems.

\- Implement land use controls (called “Institutional Controls”) to protect the remedy and public health.

\- Conduct long-term groundwater and surface water monitoring and periodic five-year reviews to ensure protectiveness of the remedy.

The cleanup is estimated to cost approximately $48 million.

In parallel to the selected remedy, studies will continue to close remaining data gaps, including to improve the characterization of bedrock topography and fractures and further delineate the extent of groundwater contamination. These OU3 RI/FS studies will be used to evaluate long-term groundwater remedial alternatives, leading to the selection in the future of a final cleanup plan for groundwater.

The 2019 Data Gaps Work Plan (DGWP) includes four systematically planned phases (1A, 1B, 2, and 3) designed to improve the understanding of the nature and extent of groundwater contamination at the Site, and ultimately complete the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for OU3. Phase 1A included surface-based geophysical data collection and concluded in August 2021. Phase 1B included the advancement of soil borings (into the subsurface) within the same study areas covered by Phase 1A, and concluded in December 2022. Phase 2 included monitoring well installation, downhole geophysical logging, and bedrock packer sampling and concluded in February 2024. The necessity of Phase 3 of the DGWP will be determined following the completion of Phase 2 data collection and analysis.

In April 2022, EPA approved Olin's commencement of a study to evaluate remedial technology options for on-site treatment of DAPL and highly contaminated groundwater that will be extracted from the aquifer. Olin carried out the study the following year and submitted a report of the treatability study results to EPA in June 2023. Olin concluded that the study was generally successful in identifying a set of treatment technologies to remediate DAPL and highly contaminated groundwater, but that more work was needed to evaluate treatment processes for ammonia, n-nitrosodimethylamine (“NDMA,” the main chemical of concern at the Site), and volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds. In August 2023, EPA required Olin to submit an addendum to the April 2022 treatability study for further evaluation of ammonia and NDMA treatment. The results of the August 2023 treatability study addendum will be transmitted to EPA and MassDEP on May 13, 2024.

EPA issued Special Notice Letters to six PRPs for the Site on September 27, 2021. The Special Notice Letters invited the PRPs to participate in negotiations with EPA to conduct or finance the cleanup actions selected for the Site in EPA’s March 30, 2021 ROD and pay EPA for Site-related costs. The ROD specifies interim actions to remove ongoing sources of contamination in groundwater and final cleanup actions for addressing contaminated soil, sediments, and surface water at the Site, estimated to cost approximately $48 million. Negotiations between EPA, MassDEP, DOJ, and four of the PRPs concluded in 2023 with DOJ filing a proposed Consent Decree in federal judicial court on May 11, 2023. The 30-day public comment period for the Consent Decree ended on June 16, 2023. EPA, MassDEP, and DOJ reviewed and formally responded to the comments that were received before filing a Motion to Enter the proposed Consent Decree on September 27th, 2023. On September 28th, 2023, the Court determined that the proposed Consent Decree satisfied the applicable applicbale legal standards and approved the settlement. Design of the groundwater extraction and treatment systems and other components of the cleanup plan is now underway.

EPA has awarded the Wilmington Environmental Restoration Committee (WERC) a grant for environmental consulting services to assist them with reviewing investigation and cleanup work. The Town of Wilmington has also retained GeoInsight, Inc. to provide technical assistance.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Olin currently samples Site-impacted media on a quarterly basis and provides a summary of the results to EPA on a semi-annual basis (in March and September). The currently-approved field sampling plan includes 139 groundwater monitoring locations, 12 surface water monitoring locations, and five sediment monitoring locations that are sampled on a quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis. The current groundwater sampling program was developed to provide ongoing assessment of Site conditions related to known areas of impact, monitor contaminant trends across the Site, evaluate groundwater and surface water interactions in on- and off-site surface water bodies, and to adequately monitor the NDMA plume in groundwater.

Additionally, Olin has sampled private wells at approximately 20 residential properties on a quarterly basis since 2010; results of the private well sampling are shared with homeowners once available. In October 2021 Olin began implementing a Private Well Survey and Sampling Plan to locate and sample private wells throughout the Olin Groundwater Study Area (GSA). The Private Well Survey and Sampling Plan required Olin to complete an initial private well survey throughout the GSA, as well as follow-up surveys every two years thereafter to identify new or existing private wells that may need to be sampled. Due to seasonal usage of some private wells for irrigation purposes, the number of private wells sampled on a quarterly basis varies. As of March 2024, approximately 30 private wells are included in the quarterly monitoring program.
