### Background

The Five Points PCE Plume site is in the Salt Lake Valley in the cities of Woods Cross City, Bountiful and North Salt Lake City in Davis County, Utah. The site consists of a groundwater plume of tetrachloroethylene (PCE), a chemical used as a dry-cleaning agent or metal degreaser.

Woods Cross City first identified PCE in its municipal drinking water well in 1988. Subsequent investigations found that the most likely source of this contamination is a dry-cleaning facility, Your Valet Cleaners (YVC), in Bountiful, Utah.

Although the plume begins in Bountiful, it travels west-southwest and most of the mile-long plume underlies Woods Cross City and North Salt Lake City. PCE is known to have been used in dry cleaning operations at YVC between 1964 and 2002 before being replaced by a liquid silicone-based dry-cleaning solution.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 2008, the Utah Department of Environmental Quality (UDEQ) assumed lead responsibility for the site. In August 2016, the UDEQ and EPA completed a Record of Decision (ROD). The ROD identifies the remedy, which includes: Extracting contaminated groundwater to hydraulically contain the plume; treatment of the extracted groundwater; and institutional controls to prevent exposure to contaminated groundwater. Currently, a remedial design is scheduled for completion in 2024.

Site activities have also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Woods Cross City shut down one of its municipal supply wells because of PCE contamination. In the summer of 2007, EPA worked with a nearby dry cleaner to remove an underground storage tank and PCE-contaminated soil.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund programâ€™s National Priorities List (NPL) in September 2007. Site investigation and cleanup are ongoing.
