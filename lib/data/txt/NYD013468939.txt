### Background

The Ludlow Sand and Gravel site is located in Paris, New York. The 18-acre area is a landfill and gravel pit on a larger 130-acre property. Disposal at the site began in the early 1960s and included domestic wastes, septic tank effluent, industrial wastes such as dyes and waste oils, and animal parts from a meat processing plant. Area residents expressed concern in 1966 when large areas of the site were left uncovered and a strong odor could be detected at a considerable distance. In 1982, sampling found trace quantities of PCBs in leachate pools on site. The District Court of Binghamton ordered the landfill closed. Dumping ceased in 1988, although the gravel pit was still in operation.

Landfill operations resulted in the contamination of soil, surface water and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. After site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983. The site’s long-term remedy has been put in place. Groundwater treatment and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Source Control: In 1988, EPA selected a remedy to contain the source of the contamination by: (1) consolidating about 10,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil and sediment adjacent to the landfill and disposing of it in the landfill and then placing either a clay or synthetic cover over it to prevent rain water from coming into contact with the buried materials; (2) collecting the leachate from seepage areas; (3) dewatering the landfill, if necessary, by using either a passive drain system or groundwater extraction wells; (4) lowering the water table to prevent groundwater from coming into contact with the waste material; (5) treating contaminated leachate and groundwater at an on-site facility or, if the volume of water was small, transporting the water and leachate to an approved federal facility; (6) fencing the site, including the wetlands; (7) controlling the future use of the property using deed restrictions; and (8) monitoring groundwater, private wells and surface water to ensure the effectiveness of the cleanup. Cleanup took place in 1991 and 1992.  

Additional contaminated soils remain at the gravel pit. The remedy, selected in March 2003, includes: (1) a predesign delineation sampling program to determine the exact area to be grouted (vertically and horizontally); (2) a remedial design program to verify the components of the conceptual design and provide the details necessary for the construction, operation, maintenance and monitoring for the remedial action; (3) soil bench-scale testing to determine the grout characteristics before grouting; (4) solidification of the area with polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations above 10 parts per million, using pressure grouting technology; (5) performing grout end point sampling and testing; (6) backfilling the gravel pit; (7) putting in two downgradient deep groundwater monitoring wells; and (8) a groundwater monitoring program to make sure contaminants have remained immobile and are not affecting the groundwater. Construction of the remedy for contaminated soils in the gravel pit finished in September 2007.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in two long-term remedial phases focused on source control and the cleanup of groundwater, surface water and soils in adjacent areas.

The site’s long-term remedy has been put in place. Groundwater treatment and monitoring are ongoing.

To date, over 40,000 cubic yards of contaminated soils and about 15,000 cubic yards of sediments have been dug up from the adjacent wetlands and gravel pit and consolidated in the landfill. The leachate is collected from the seepage areas. A drainage system has been installed and operates to dewater the landfill. A final cap was placed over the landfill. Collected water is treated using a system on site. These actions have removed the potential for contact of the water with the contaminants and, therefore, have prevented further migration of contamination from the landfill into the environment.

The 2003 ROD required that institutional controls be put into place to prohibit groundwater use and to limit land use at the site to nonresidential purposes, and any activities that could affect the integrity of the landfill cover. The instituional controls were implemented with the execution of the Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions & Environmental Easement on August 2013. A Final Close-out Report documenting this determination was signed on September 6, 2013. A Notice of Intent to Delete the site from the NPL and a Notice of Deletion were published in the Federal Register on October 2, 2013. The site was deleted from the NPL on December 2, 2013. Although the site was deleted from the NPL, five-year reviews will continue as needed to ensure that the implemented cleanup remedy at the site is functioning as intended and continues to be protective of human health and the environment..
