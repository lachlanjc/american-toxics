### Background

The 140-acre AT&SF (Clovis) site is located in Clovis, New Mexico. The site includes Santa Fe Lake and surrounding uplands. The lake on site has received stormwater and wastewater discharge from the nearby rail yard since the early 1900s. Activities at the rail yard contributing to the discharge have included hopper car washing operations, boiler blowdowns, sanitary sewers and the oil-water separators at the diesel fueling racks. These activities contaminated surface water, sediment and soil at the site. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL). Monitoring is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

The health and environment of over 31,000 people living near the site will be protected from potential groundwater and windblown contaminants from the site.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires an evaluation of contamination in groundwater and continued groundwater monitoring.

The site is located about one mile south of the present-day Burlington Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF) rail yard in Clovis, Curry County, New Mexico. Burlington Northern merged with AT&SF in 1995 and railroad operations merged in 1996. The site includes Santa Fe Lake and surrounding uplands and encompasses about 140 acres. As a natural playa lake, the lake basin has received intermittent run-on into the lake throughout history, including stormwater and wastewater discharge from the rail yard since the early 1900s. The amount of wastewater discharged has changed through time as well.

The site is bordered on the north by a cattle feed lot and property belonging to Koch Industries, to the east by Main Street, to the south by Kimberly Lane, and to the west by County Road K. Agricultural croplands are located across Kimberly Lane and County Road K. The site is located over the Ogallala Aquifer, which is used as a source of drinking water for the city of Clovis. The site is also a habitat for migratory birds.

About 31,000 people live within a three-mile radius of the site. Residential properties are located across Main Street from the site. The nearest residence is 2,000 feet from the site. The nearest drinking water well is 1,200 feet from the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The long-term remedy included construction of a dike around Santa Fe Lake, use of a spray system to evaporate lake water, excavation and treatment of sediment, placement of treated sediments in a capped on-site storage facility, bioremediation of soil, construction of a fence around the site, and institutional controls. Construction of the remedy finished in 2000. Cleanup activities treated about 187,000 cubic yards of soil and sediment. The site has been restored with native grasses and limited impoundment of water.
