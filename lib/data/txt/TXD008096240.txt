### Background

The 11-acre Jasper Creosoting Company Inc. site is located in Jasper, Texas. Between 1946 and 1986, wood treatment operations on site used a steam preconditioning and pressurized creosote and pentachlorophenol (PCP) process. These operations contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following construction of the site’s remedy, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) conducts operation and maintenance activities at the site.

The remediation of site contamination will ensure the protection of human health and the environment and encourage reuse of the property.

EPA has conducted five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. For the remedy to be protective in the long term, the five-year review recommended annual monitoring of surface water, implementation of enforceable institutional controls, evaluation of vapor intrusion potential and re-evaluation of the site’s cleanup goals in light of revised toxicity data.

Wood treatment operations took place at the site between 1946 and 1986 using a steam preconditioning and pressurized creosote and PCP process. Aboveground storage tanks on the northern part of the site stored creosote and PCP dissolved in a diesel carrier fluid. Three treatment cylinders next to the tanks stored creosote for PCP wood treatment. Following treatment, the wood was removed and transferred to a drip pad for air drying.

Between 1946 and 1964, the facility discharged wastewater from the creosoting process directly to a drainage ditch running parallel to the eastern edge of the site. From 1964 to 1971, wastewater discharged to the City of Jasper's wastewater treatment facility. However, in 1971, the facility resumed wastewater discharge to the drainage ditch.

In 1981, an investigation linked facility operations to a fish kill in Sandy Creek.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy, selected in 2006, included institutional controls to restrict land use, long-term groundwater monitoring, construction of a hydraulic containment system and dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) recovery system, establishment of a technical impracticality zone (TIZ) where restoration of groundwater quality to drinking water standards was determined to be impractical, and institutional controls for a designated plume management zone (PMZ) to restrict groundwater use in and adjacent to the TIZ. EPA signed the site's Preliminary Close-Out Report in September 2008, documenting the completion of remedy construction. Operation and maintenance activities and long-term monitoring are ongoing.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Between 1996 and 2006, three time-critical removal actions by EPA addressed immediate threats posed by the contamination of site sediment, soil and surface water. The removal actions involved the construction of a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) containment cell, and the excavation and removal of contaminated soil, sediment and surface water from a drainage ditch, wetland water inlet area and waste cell. EPA disposed of the contaminated media in the containment cell.
