### Background

The Johns’ Sludge Pond is a half-acre site in Wichita, Kansas. From 1951 to 1970, the Super Refined Oil Company recycled waste oil and disposed of about 7,000 cubic yards of oily sludge in an unlined pond. These activities contaminated groundwater with lead and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Following cleanup, maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing. The EPA removed the site from the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1992.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and Potentially Responsible Party actions.

The EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The sixth Five Year Review was completed on August 22, 2022.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Following cleanup, the EPA selected a “no further action” remedy for the site in 1989. After cleanup, the EPA removed the site from the National Priorities List in 1992.
