### Background

The 1,500-acre Ciba-Geigy Corp. (McIntosh Plant) [Superfund](https://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located about one mile Northeast of McIntosh on 1379 Ciba Road, Washington County, Alabama. The Site includes 1,130 acres of active plant facilities, as well as 170 acres of undeveloped cypress swamp and bottomland hardwood forest in the floodplain of the Tombigbee River. The Site is bounded by undeveloped pine forest to the north; on the south by the Olin Corp. (McIntosh Plant) Superfund Site; on the west by private property; and on the east by the Tombigbee River and surrounding floodplains. The current facility property extends beyond a railroad right of way on the western portion of the Site toward U.S. Highway 43. The floodplain is separated from the developed plant property by a steep escarpment, known locally as the bluff line.

The Ciba-Geigy Corporation (now BASF Corporation) began production of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) starting in 1952, with peak production occurring in the mid 1950’s. Due to decreased sales of DDT, the Ciba-Geigy Corporation expanded facility operations in 1956 to produce another pesticide, diazinon. All production of DDT ceased by 1965. By 1970, the plant was also producing fluorescent brighteners used in laundry products, herbicides, insecticides, and other agricultural and industrial products. Production later expanded to include resins and additives used by the plastics industry and specialty chemical products. Ciba-Geigy Corporation stopped producing agricultural chemicals in 1999 and shut down herbicide and insecticide production in 2003. The Plant currently has two production units in operation which produce antioxidants and light stabilizers for use in industrial settings. During past operations, production waste was disposed of in several unlined pits and open landfills on the property. Prior to 1965, wastewater from the BASF McIntosh Plant discharged into the Tombigbee River after chemicals were treated. The EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1984 because of contaminated groundwater, soil, sludge and sediment resulting from waste disposal practices. The site has been investigated and steps have been taken to clean up the site. The BASF McIntosh Plant includes both a RCRA facility and an NPL Site, meaning that both the EPA and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) are working on the cleanup under different programs.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

BASF Corporation, the site’s primary PRP, leads site investigation and cleanup activities with oversight provided by the EPA and ADEM.

The RCRA Corrective Action program continues to address groundwater contamination.

To manage site investigations and cleanup, the EPA divided the Site into four [operable units (OUs)](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#o):

- OU-1: Shallow alluvial groundwater aquifer;
- OU-2: Soils at 10 of 11 former waste management units;
- OU-3: Floodplain, including the effluent ditch and areas in the Tombigbee River within close proximity to the Site Plant catch basins, a stormwater conveyance and upstream drainage ditch located in the upland portion of site; and
- OU-4: former waste management area designated as Site 8 (or bluff line site) and upland portion of the dilute ditch.

**1982**

Initial site assessment conducted and notification of potential environmental threats.

**1983**

The site was proposed for listing on the NPL.

**1984**

Site was finalized to the NPL.

OU-2/OU-4: An evaluation of the waste disposal operations on the Alluvial Aquifer was performed.

**1985**

RCRA corrective action program (CAP) began to treat contaminated groundwater.

**1986**

OU-1: The EPA wrote Record of Decision (ROD) for OU-1. The selected remedial alternative was “No Further Action” given corrective action wells from the RCRA CAP are reversing the hydraulic gradient of groundwater and preventing migration of contaminants offsite.

**1987**

OU-2/OU-4: Combined Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) was initiated. RCRA closure was implemented for surface impoundments and tanks.

**1991**

OU-2: The EPA wrote the ROD for OU-2. The selected remedy included excavating, treating, and disposing of contaminated soil and sludge in onsite landfills; and required institutional controls to restrict land and groundwater use.

**1992**

The EPA entered into an Administrative Order of Consent (AOC) with Ciba-Geigy Corporation to conduct further remedial investigations on the site.

OU-2: Remedial Design (RD) for selected remedy was started. The EPA entered into a Consent Decree (CD) with Ciba-Geigy Corporation to conduct RD and Remedial Action (RA) activities.

OU-4: RI/FS was completed. The EPA wrote the ROD for OU-4. The selected remedy included excavating, treating, and disposing of contaminated soil and sludge in onsite landfills and installing a slurry wall to assist the groundwater treatment system used under the RCRA CAP.

**1993**

OU-2/OU-4: RD started for OU-4. An Explanations of Significant Differences (ESDs) was needed for both OUs to allow for the disposal of only solidified/stabilized waste and soil in an onsite RCRA Minimum Technology Subtitle C land vault.

**1994**

OU-2: First amendment for CD was signed.

OU-3: RI/FS addendum was completed. Selected remedy alternatives were evaluated.

OU-4: The EPA entered into CD with Ciba-Geigy Corporation to conduct RD and RA activities.

**1995**

OU-3: The EPA wrote ROD for OU-3. The selected remedy included excavating, treating, and disposing of DDTR-contaminated soil and sediment onsite. If excavation and treatment were not effective, living organisms were used to break down contaminants as an alternative cleanup method.

**1996**

OU-2/OU-4: Final RD report was submitted to the EPA. RA was started with excavation of contaminated soil and sludge. Slurry wall was constructed around OU-4.

OU-3: RD was started for OU-3 floodplain. The EPA entered into a CD with Ciba-Geigy Corporation to conduct RD and RA activities for OU-3.

**1998**

OU-2/OU-4: Construction of thermal treatment system was completed and began operation. One hundred twenty-five thousand (125,000) tons of contaminated soil and sediment was treated using the thermal treatment system onsite.

OU-3: RD was completed and RA was initiated.

**1999**

OU-2/OU-4: RA completed and operations and maintenance (O&M) started.

OU-3: Excavation and backfilling were completed in floodplain. Soil containing over 500ppm of DDTR was treated. Soil below 500 ppm was used as backfill for OU-2.

**2000**

OU-3: Mosquito fish, mudworm, and sediment sampling were conducted post-construction to monitor DDTR in biota and environment.

OU-4: Slurry wall was evaluated to determine effectiveness. From this evaluation, it was determined that the slurry wall was successfully diverting groundwater toward an interceptor well from the RCRA CAP.

**2001**

The EPA conducted Five-Year Review (FYR) sitewide. The following recommendations were stated: 1.) Additional Five-Year Reviews of CERCLA OU-1 were not required. 2.) Continue monitoring biota and sediment in OU-3 floodplain. 3.) Health-based performance standards for soil contamination defined in OU-2 and OU-4 were fully achieved.

OU-2/OU-4: Ciba entered into a restrictive covenant to prevent excavation of soils in remediated areas.

**2006**

The EPA conducted second FYR. The FYR stated that continued groundwater monitoring and regular inspection of vegetative covers were recommended. The EPA recommended additional remediation for OU-3 floodplain.

**2007**

OU-3: Plant community surveys and habitat evaluations were conducted for OU-3. Additional remediation alternatives for cleanup of floodplain were considered.

**2008**

OU-3: The EPA issued an ESD in 2008 which required implementation of a sand cover to act as a barrier between ecological receptors, such as fish-eating birds, and DDT, DDD, DDE (collectively referred to as DDTR) contamination. The PRP completed the cover installation in November 2008.

**2009-2010**

BASF Corporation acquired Ciba Specialty Chemicals. PRP responsibilities were transferred over to BASF Corporation for site clean-up.

OU-3: Annual monitoring of sand cover and sampling of mosquito fish continued.

**2011**

The EPA conducted third FYR. The site's overall remedy was considered protective in the short term because the remedy at each OU was functioning as expected and there were no completed exposure pathways at the site. However, contamination in the Miocene aquifer was identified leaving the site near the Olin Corporation Superfund property. Because the extent of the contamination was unclear, further evaluation to characterize the source and extent of contamination was needed and potential actions may have been needed to be performed to ensure cleanup objectives were met.

**2012**

Offsite wells in Miocene aquifer were installed to monitor Miocene aquifer contamination. These wells are monitored on a quarterly basis.

**2014**

OU-3: RD was completed, and operation and maintenance (O&M) activities began. O&M activities include mosquito fish sampling and cover sampling, inspection, and maintenance.

**2015**

OU-2/OU-4: Remediated waste management areas continued to be inspected for signs of erosion. Vegetative covers were determined to still be intact.

OU-3: The EPA required additional investigation and characterization of contamination to biota, sediments, soils and surface water.

**2016**

The EPA conducted fourth FYR of the site. The FYR stated: 1.) continued coordination with ADEM was recommended to monitor contaminants in OU-1 Aquifer. 2.) Modification of the clean-up goals was recommended for all effected media because the current cover in the OU-3 floodplain may not have been protective of ecological receptors or meet surface water criteria. 3.) Implementation of institutional controls (ICs) was needed for the OU-3 floodplain.

OU-3: BASF Corporation entered into an environmental covenant to restrict use of sand covered area in OU-3 floodplain.

**2019**

OU-3: The EPA issued an ESD that changed the soil/sediment cleanup levels established in the 1995 ROD from risk-management based cleanup levels to risk based cleanup levels; and changed the fish tissue performance standards contained in the 2008 ESD for DDTR. The ESD also modified the Remedial Action Objectives (RAOs) for protection of surface water and reduction of risk for ecological receptors exposed to DDTR present in Ciba OU-3 media.

**2020**

OU-2/OU-4: The EPA completed remedy optimization study and found that the groundwater recovery system should be optimized to better contain groundwater contamination.

OU-3: The EPA determined that the remedy is not performing as designed and was not protective of the environment and directed the PRP to perform an additional investigation, evaluation, and remediation of OU-3.

**2021-2022**

OU-3: BASF Corporation conducted fieldwork to collect environmental data to support further cleanup efforts in floodplain.

**2023**

OU-1, 2, and 4: The EPA and ADEM notified BASF Corporation that not enough progress was being made under the Superfund remedial action and the RCRA corrective action. Groundwater monitoring wells have contaminants that are increasing and exceeded groundwater cleanup levels which indicates continuing active sources. The EPA and ADEM instructed BASF Corporation to develop and implement characterization plans for potential source areas.

OU-3: BASF Corporation submitted in December 2023 a [Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) for OU-3](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11199449) to address additional contamination found at the site.

**2024**

OU-3: The EPA reviewed and revised (cured) FFS in March 2024.

The EPA issued an Amended ROD, in consultation with ADEM, selecting a remedy addressing the upgradient DDTR sources and improvement/repair of the affected existing OU3 floodplain remedy, in the following areas:

- Operational Plant Area Catch Basins, Upstream Drainage Ditch, and Upstream Conveyance Ditch (UDD): Best Management Practices (BMPs) and Engineered Cap- $9.89 Million
- Floodplain Drainage Ditch (FDD): Partial Ditch Rerouting and Engineered Cap- $6.12 Million
- Floodplain Deposition Areas North and South of Floodplain Drainage Ditch, and Cypress Swamp and Swale (FDA): Engineered Cap with Enhanced Natural Recovery (ENR)- $8.71 Million
- Total cost- $24.72 Million

### What Is the Current Site Status?

OU-1, 2, and 4: BASF Corporation currently conducts groundwater monitoring at OU-1 under the EPA Superfund program and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) RCRA program. In 2020, EPA completed an optimization study and identified that the Site had not attained groundwater cleanup standards. EPA competed an assessment of groundwater cleanup progress and have determined additional actions are warranted.

OU-3: The EPA is providing oversight of remedial design activities performed by BASF Corporation.

Some of the activities at OU-3 (2021-2024) include:

- Collection of sediment, surface water, porewater and groundwater samples throughout the catch basins, stormwater conveyance, upstream drainage ditch and floodplain.
- Collection of LiDAR and Bathymetry data and ecological surveys, i.e., wetland, terrestrial habitat and species, benthic macroinvertebrate, and mussel surveys.
- Development and completion of an FFS for the catch basins, upstream conveyance, upstream drainage ditch, and floodplain.
- Issuance of a Proposed Plan for public comment showcasing the EPA’s preferred alternative for the upstream source areas, floodplain drainage ditch, and floodplain deposition areas including cypress swamp and swale.
- Publication of an AROD in August 2024 after consideration of public comments.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls (ICs) called for:

- OU-1: Prevent the use of groundwater in the Alluvial aquifer at the Site (Environmental Covenant February 5, 2016).
- Miocene Groundwater: Prevent the use of groundwater in the Miocene aquifer at the Site (Environmental Covenant February 5, 2016).
- OU-2/OU-4 Soil: Prevent excavation of soil (Restrictive Covenant May 31, 2001).
- OU-3 Soil and Sediment: Prevent activities that would compromise the protectiveness of the sand cover in place (Environmental Covenant January 7, 2016). BASF Corporation will need to work with the Olin Corporation to implement ICs for the portion of OU-3 that is on the Olin Corporation property.
- OU-3 AROD: ICs include revision to the existing recorded restrictive environmental covenant to include land use and activity restrictions in areas that are remediated (UDD, FDD, FDA).

### Sampling and Monitoring

To make sure the sand cover remains an effective barrier, the PRPs inspect the sand cover and sample surface water and fish on an annual basis. The EPA performs Five Year Reviews (FYRs) to ensure the remedy is, or will be, protective of human health and the environment. The fifth FYR was completed in August 2021, and the next FYR will be performed in 2026.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, the EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA issued an order and negotiated multiple Consent Decrees during the 1990s with the site PRP, Ciba-Geigy Corporation, whose liability successor, BASF Corporation, is now responsible for conducting Site investigation and cleanup activities under the EPA’s oversight pursuant to the existing Consent Decrees addressing the multiple operable units at the Site. BASF continues to fund Site cleanup, monitoring, and oversight activities.
