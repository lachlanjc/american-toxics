### Background

The approximately one-acre Sanford Dry Cleaners [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in Sanford in east-central Florida. Lake Monroe is located one half-mile north of the site. The site includes two adjacent properties with buildings located at 113, 117 and 121 South Palmetto Avenue. All three buildings are currently vacant. The City of Sanford owns two of the buildings; a non-profit organization owns the third. Several commercial properties border the site, including a plumbing business, a restaurant, pottery and wine stores, and an art studio. Several residential properties are also located in the area.

From the 1940s until 2001, several businesses used the site as a laundry and dry-cleaning facility. The first dry cleaning facility established on site was Downtown Drycleaners and Laundry in the 1940s. The chemical tetrachloroethylene, also called perchloroethylene, PERC or PCE, was the primary solvent used in the dry-cleaning operations.

In 2005, EPA and the [Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP)](https://floridadep.gov/) began investigating site conditions to assess the source of site contamination and how far potential contaminants may have spread. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 2010 because of contaminated groundwater and soil resulting from past operations.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. EPA in collaboration with FDEP implemented all actions necessary to make sure that local residents and the environment are safe from site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**2011 – 2013**  
EPA conducted the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study for site and issued the cleanup plan and Record of Decision (ROD).

**2014 – 2015**  
From November 2014 to February 2015, EPA implemented all clean up measures specified in the cleanup plan and Record of Decision (ROD) for the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA in collaboration with FDEP completed cleanup activities in February 2015.

The [most recent Five-Year Reveiw](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11150257) was published by EPA HQ in 2020.

Contaminated soil outside the building has been excavated and transported at an approved disposal facility.

Contaminated soil inside the building is cleaned up using a technology called soil vapor extraction (SVE).

The contaminated groundwater is being treated using a technology called in-situ enhanced bioremediation where microbes are injected in the groundwater to degrade the contaminants. EPA is currently monitoring the groundwater to ensure the cleanup is effective.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

In November 2008, FDEP referred the site to the EPA for cleanup enforcement under CERCLA.

In September 2010, EPA placed the site on the NPL.
