Background
﻿The Atlantic Wood Industries (AWI) Site is approximately 50 acres of land on the industrialized waterfront of Portsmouth, Virginia, and over 30 acres of contaminated sediments in the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River. This land is surrounded by the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River, and several other small industrial properties. From 1926 to 1992, a wood-treating facility operated at the site using both creosote and pentachlorophenol (PCP). The site was contaminated from the treatment operation, storage of treated wood and disposal of wastes. 
At one time, the Navy leased part of the property from AWI and disposed of waste on site, including used abrasive blast media from the sand blasting of naval equipment resulting in contamination with heavy metals such as copper, lead, zinc and arsenic. The Navy also disposed of sludge from the production of acetylene in a wetland on the border of the Southgate Annex of the Shipyard and the AWI Site. 
Sediments in the Elizabeth River contain heavy metals and visible creosote. The groundwater and soil at the site are also contaminated with creosote and heavy metals. 
Currently, AWI operates a pre-stressed concrete products manufacturing facility at the site. The site is about seven miles from the Chesapeake Bay. Approximately 14,000 people work within a half-mile radius of the site. The drinking water supply within a three-mile radius is provided by public utilities. Groundwater in this area is not used as a drinking water source.
The site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL)  in 1990.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Atlantic Wood Industries (AWI) completed an EPA-directed removal action (short-term cleanup) in 1995. AWI installed a liner in a storm sewer to prevent creosote from entering the sewer and migrating to the river. AWI also excavated approximately 660 cubic yards of contaminated sediment from the inlet.
EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in 1995, describing how the Agency was to address contaminated soil. The ROD required that most of the soil be treated using bioremediation (using bacteria to break down contaminants). 
During the design phase of the cleanup, new information was collected which indicated that the site was more contaminated than previously thought. As a result, EPA determined that the cleanup called for in the 1995 ROD would not have been the most appropriate plan and decided to conduct an additional feasibility study that could take this new information into account. In 2002, EPA, AWI and the Navy reached an agreement to undertake a removal action to cleanup acetylene sludge from an on-site wetland and to cap an abrasive blast media (ABM) disposal area. The sludge removal and the wetland restoration were completed in 2003. The ABM work has been put on hold and was eventually included as part of the overall soil cleanup.  Another ROD was signed in December 2007. This ROD addresses all Site contamination in soil, sediments and groundwater and replaces the 1995 ROD. During the summer and fall of 2008, EPA collected a variety of samples including sediment samples to determine the extent of dredging and to obtain the physical property data for the design of the sheet pile wall that was necessary to contain the dredged sediment. The river sediments contained visible creosote and heavy metals from ship paint. EPA also conducted a cultural resources survey to look for and document historical resources at the site. In 2012, FIGG Bridge completed the South Norfolk Jordan Bridge across the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River. The bridge goes through the site, and FIGG conducted a portion of the cleanup. In 2013, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a project to treat approximately 45,000 cubic yards of creosote and pentachlorophenol-contaminated soil in the southwestern portion of the site. The work was performed in-situ, meaning that the contamination was treated while it was still in the ground. The USACE also finished constructing a large steel pile wall several hundred feet from the shore to isolate the contaminated sediments from the rest of the river and to provide space to consolidated sediments outside the wall that required dredging.﻿ In 2013, EPA extended the Portsmouth storm sewer from Elm Avenue across the AWI facility to the river and constructed a groundwater collection trench. In the fall of 2017, EPA completed dredging about 24 acres of the river approximately 360,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediment from the river. This was the largest phase of the approximately $100 million cleanup and addressed the worst area of contamination in the industrial river, which flows to the Chesapeake Bay. Most of the sediment was mixed with cement and some of the sediment/cement mixture was used to cover an additional seven acres of heavily contaminated area of the river behind the wall creating new land. The rest of the dredged sediment went to an area of the site away from the river where a landfill was constructed. In 2020, EPA completed the landfill construction, capping the site, planting trees to control ground water, installation of a secondary sheet pile wall behind the first sheet pile wall, and installing dolphin piles to protect the sheet pile wall. EPA is also conducting monitoring activities in the river and for the ground water. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA is evaluating recently collected ground water data to determine if additional groundwater controls are necessary. EPA, Atlantic Wood Industries, and others are undertaking maintenance activities as necessary to ensure components of the remedy continue to function as designed.  EPA has conducted two five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies protect public health and the environment, and that they function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent, 2020 Five-Year Review (PDF), concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. The next five-year review will be completed by 2025.  Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
At this site, activity and use limitations, known as institutional controls (ICs),are required in accordance the 2007 ROD. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. 
EPA will apply institutional controls to ensure the remedy is protective in both the short term and long term. Institutional controls will ensure, for example, that future construction does not adversely affect the remedy (for example, to avoid vapor intrusion), provide notice to new landowners to prevent inappropriate future land use, educate and warn the public against consumption of fish and shellfish from the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River, and prevent use of groundwater for drinking purposes.

Emergency Response and Removal
During construction activities, creosote contamination was discovered in a city sewer outside the area being cleaned up at that time. EPA conducted an emergency response and repaired the sewer line to prevent creosote contamination from entering the Elizabeth River.    More information about this Removal Action can be found on the EPA's On-Scene Coordinator's (OSC) website.

Enforcement Information
The United States and the Commonwealth of Virginia have entered into an agreement under which the EPA and Virginia recovered nearly $64 million to address cleanup costs at the Atlantic Wood Industries (AWI) Superfund Site in Portsmouth, VA. In accordance with a consent decree (PDF) entered in federal court on April 30, 2019, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of the Navy will pay EPA $55.3 million for cleanup costs, and pay Virginia $8.5 million for past costs and future activities Virginia will conduct at the site. Along with cleanup costs, DoD and the Navy provided funds for a $1.5 million oyster restoration project recently completed on the Eastern Branch of﻿ the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River.   The settlement also provides that Atlantic Wood Industries and Atlantic Metrocast, the AWI Site owners/operators, will reimburse EPA and Virginia $250,000 plus interest for site cleanup costs.
