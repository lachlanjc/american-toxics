### Background

The redevelopment of the American Crossarm & Conduit Co. Superfund site in Chehalis, Washington, marked the end of a legacy of contamination and the beginning of a new chapter for the property. During its operation, American Crossarm & Conduit Co. dumped wastewater contaminated with wood treating chemicals, fuels, and solvents into an unlined pit on the 16-acre site. Facility operations, a flood, a facility fire and waste disposal practices contaminated ground water, surface water, soil and sediments with pentachlorophenol ( [PCP](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=semi-volatile+organic+compounds) ), creosote and other hazardous chemicals.

In 1989, EPA listed the site on the Superfund program's National Priorities List. Cleanup actions included removing contaminated soil, demolishing contaminated site structures, removing oil from groundwater and covering excavated areas with clean soil. Despite the site’s favorable location, a $15.5 million EPA cleanup lien against the site presented a barrier to developers.

In the late 1990s, EPA agreed to remove its lien on the condition that any new owners add fill so the property would be above the flood plain. Owners also agreed not to dig into the site’s cap, use the groundwater or sell the property without passing on the land use restrictions. This agreement made redevelopment a reality at the site with a new on-site structure constructed in 1998. After construction, the owner sold the building, which is currently being used as a machine and repair shop. A second two-story building constructed on site currently houses a fitness center.

**Site status**

The former facility closed in 1983. In 1986, the State and EPA began addressing contamination at the Site. EPA issued a final cleanup plan in 1993 and completed the cleanup in 1996. All cleanup activities have been completed and remedial action objectives met. The EPA signed a Final Close Out Report in 2020 and deleted the site from the National Priorities List.

The landowner is required to maintain the soil cap and ensure that current activities will not lead to exposure to contaminated subsurface soils. EPA reviews the continued protectiveness of the site at least once every 5 years. The site has been redeveloped and is presently being used by commercial businesses.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1986 and 1992 EPA installed containment at all tanks and sumps, demolished facility structures, and removed drums and other hazardous materials on the ground surface. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in 1989. EPA issued a final cleanup plan in 1993 and completed the cleanup in 1996.

Contaminated soil in nearby residential and commercial properties was excavated to levels that will protect residents. All cleanup levels have been met and no unacceptable human health risks remain in these areas.

In the former facility area, the most-heavily contaminated soils were excavated and disposed at a regulated facility for contaminated wastes. The excavated areas were backfilled with clean soil and then covered with geotextile fabric, pit run gravel, and at least one foot of clean soil. Since some contaminated soils remain at depth, the landowner is required to maintain the soil cap. In addition, this area must not be used for residential, agricultural, and groundwater uses.

All cleanup actions have been implemented. EPA signed a Final Close Out Report in 2020 and deleted the site from the National Priorities List.

The Washington Department of Ecology is responsible for oversight of cap maintenance.

The site is being addressed through federal actions.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

All cleanup activities have been completed. An Administrative Order on Consent requires the landowner to protect the remedy and maintain the cap while prohibiting residential, agricultural, and groundwater use on the former American Crossarm & Conduit property. Washington Department of Ecology is responsible for oversight and maintenance. EPA is required to review the protectiveness of the remedy every five years.

A Final Close Out Report was signed by EPA in 2020 and the site was removed from the National Priorities List.
