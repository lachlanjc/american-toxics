### Background

The seven-acre Cedartown Industries, Inc. [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located at 404 South Furnace Street in Cedartown, Georgia, 60-miles northwest of Atlanta. Site features include an office building, a truck maintenance building and the former foundry building’s foundation. Concrete, gravel, and grass cover the site. Industrial and agricultural land uses border the site to the north and south. Residential areas are located northeast, east and southeast of the site. Cedar Creek borders the site to the west. A chain-link fence surrounds the site to the north, south and east.

In 1874, the Cherokee Furnace Company began foundry operations at the site, smelting iron ore from regional iron mines near Cedartown. In the 1930s, the company changed its name to Cedartown Foundry and, in addition to foundry operations, manufactured pumps and plow blades. From 1978 until 1980, a secondary lead smelting facility operated at the site.

In 1986, the [Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD)](https://epd.georgia.gov/) conducted a site inspection. The inspection found that site activities contaminated site soil, sediment and groundwater with heavy metals. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1990 because of contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater resulting from facility operations.

EPA, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (Georgia EPD) and the site’s [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site. By monitoring groundwater, placing institutional controls on the site property and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, Georgia EPD and the site’s PRPs continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site.

The site has returned to productive use. In 1984, the site’s current owners bought the facility and currently operate a trucking business there.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s PRPs led site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with EPA and Georgia EPD.

**1990**  
The Cedartown Industries PRP Group, the site’s PRPs, conducted an Interim Waste Removal activity to remove a slag pile, contaminated debris, soil, wastewater and sediment from the site. The PRPs removed 8,380 tons of contaminated material and transported it to an off-site landfill.

**1993**  
The site's long-term remedy was selected in the Record of Decision (ROD) and included:

- excavation of contaminated soil
- solidifying and stabilizing contaminated soil off site
- disposing of solidified and stabilized soil on site
- using monitored natural attenuation to address contamination in groundwater
- placing institutional controls on the site property in the form of deed restrictions and record notices to restrict land and groundwater use.

**1996-99**  
Construction of the soils remedy was completed in 1996, while monitoring of the groundwater contamination began.

The PRPs began a groundwater monitoring program in 1996 and continued quarterly monitoring until 1999.

**1999 – 2001**  
From 1999 to 2001, the PRPs conducted semi-annual monitoring of the groundwater. Regular groundwater monitoring was discontinued after the April 2001 sampling event; however, the groundwater at the site has been sampled with each Five Year Review conducted for the site.

**2006**  
The site was deleted from the National Priorities List in 2006.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11050365.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2016. The site remedy is protective of human health and the environment.

The site’s PRPs continue to conduct ground water monitoring during Five-Year Reviews. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. Due to elevated lead levels found in groundwater, the fourth FYR recommended additional sampling at the site. Groundwater and Cedar Creek have been sampled on several occasions since December 2016.

EPA plans to complete the fifth Five-Year Review in 2021. As part of that FYR, the need for additional monitoring or remedial work will be re-evaluated.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

A chain-link fence surrounds the site to the north, south and east.

Deed restrictions are in place to restrict land and groundwater use.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRPs to investigate and clean up the site. The PRPs continue to fund site monitoring and oversight activities.
