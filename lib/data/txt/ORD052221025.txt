### Background

The 305-acre Martin-Marietta Aluminum Co. site is located in The Dalles, Oregon. Smelting operations took place at the site between 1958 and 1987. Site activities and years of improper waste disposal contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1996. Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

Martin-Marietta acquired the facility in 1970, from Harvey Aluminum, Inc. and continued aluminum processing operations until 1984, when the plant was shut down. In 1986, Martin-Marietta leased the plant to Northwest Aluminum Company, which operated until 1987. Twenty-eight areas were contaminated from treatment, storage and disposal of waste at the site. A 15-acre landfill, now capped, contains about 200,000 cubic yards of waste and construction debris, including asbestos, metallic wastes and 5,000 tons of spent potline materials (cathode waste).

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents.

In the most recent review, EPA determined the remedy is protective in the short-term because adequate restrictions are in place to prevent exposure to the remaining waste left in place in the CERCLA Landfill and Scrubber Sludge Ponds. The S Aquifer is not currently being used as a drinking water source, and groundwater contaminants of concern (COC) concentrations are below Record of Decision (ROD) cleanup levels in the A and B aquifers.

However, in order for the remedy to be protective in the long-term, the following actions were recommended to be taken: Institutional controls in the form of deed restrictions need to be added to the three parcels along River Road to restrict use of the S aquifer.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included excavating cathode waste material and placing it into an on-site landfill; capping the landfill; capping two sludge ponds; and groundwater treatment and monitoring. Cleanup activities also included collecting and treating landfill leachate; abandoning nearby water wells; connecting groundwater users to the City of The Dalles water supply system; establishing a contingency plan to recover groundwater in the event further contamination is detected; and land use controls. Remedy construction took place between 1989 and 1994. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.  

Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1996.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions in 2012 included restricting access to capped areas; repairing signage and fencing; and addressing releases of toxic, asphyxiating and explosive gases at the site.
