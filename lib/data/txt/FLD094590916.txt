### Background

The 9.5-acre Callaway & Son Drum Services (CSDS) [Superfund](https://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located at 890 East Lake Alfred Drive in Lake Alfred, Polk County, Florida. The site is located along U.S. Highway 17-92, about one-mile northeast of Lake Alfred. Areas surrounding the site include active residential and light industrial land uses. A sewage treatment plant is located west of the site. A single-story apartment complex is located east of the site.

The site is the former location of a 55-gallon drum refurbishing and resale facility, which operated from mid-1977 through early 1991. The site includes three major structures, which are now in dilapidated condition: a former office building, a drum cleaning structure, and a sandblasting and painting structure. A 45,300-square-foot percolation pond was located east of the drum cleaning area and received rinse water from drum cleaning operations.

Operations ceased in February 1991, when the facility came to the [Florida Department of Environmental Protection’s (FDEP)](https://floridadep.gov/) attention after the company submitted an application to build and operate an industrial wastewater treatment and disposal system (for the discharge of rinse water used in its drum cleaning process).

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund Program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 2000 because of contaminated groundwater, soil and surface water resulting from facility operations. The EPA and the FDEP have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. The EPA took the site off the NPL in 2009 after completing cleanup activities.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The EPA led site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with FDEP and took several cleanup actions at the site.

**2001**  
The EPA removed and disposed of approximately 2,500 empty and partially empty drums. Most drums were empty. The EPA recovered the drums from the banks of the site’s percolation pond, which is a manmade pond that allows wastewater to gradually enter the ground. In addition, Polk County worked with the EPA to remove tires from the site.

**2003**  
In 2003, the EPA finalized the site’s remedial investigation (RI), which included an ecological risk assessment. The EPA found several contaminants, primarily near the former drum cleaning area.

At the request of FDEP, the EPA resampled the former drum cleaning area to better identify these contaminants and determine any potential risk associated with them. The EPA analyzed the samples using high-resolution mass spectrometry at the EPA’s Office of Research and Development in Las Vegas, Nevada. This office provides information on the toxicity of compounds not routinely found at sites.

**2005**  
The EPA completed research on the potential toxicity of the identified contaminants in late 2005 and identified about 60 compounds in the soil samples.

**2006**  
In early 2006, the EPA procured non-target laboratory standards for re-analysis of the site’s soil. The results indicated that, although standards were available for a limited number of the suspected contaminants, those measured appeared to be below levels of concern.

**2007**  
At the request of FDEP, the EPA completed a similar exercise with the site’s groundwater during the summer of 2007.

In September 2007, the EPA issued a [No Further Action Record of Decision (ROD)](https://sems.epa.gov/work/1556306688453/04-10505557.pdf), with FDEP's concurrence.

**2009**  
The EPA deleted the site from the NPL.

**2012**  
The EPA determined that Five-Year Reviews are not necessary for the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is currently vacant and not in use. The site property could support industrial, commercial or residential uses in the future.

The EPA does not expect any need for additional cleanup at the site. Since no hazardous substances were conclusively identified at the site, Region 4 has determined that no further review, discretionary or otherwise, is needed for this site.
