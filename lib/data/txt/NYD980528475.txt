### Background

The 5-acre Cortese Landfill site was operated from 1970 to 1981 by the John Cortese Construction Company, receiving, primarily, municipal wastes. Industrial wastes, including waste solvents, paint thinners, paint sludges, and waste oils, were disposed of at the landfill in 1973. Records indicated that an estimated 5,000 to 8,000 drums were buried on the site at that time. In the early 1980s, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation found volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and heavy metals in the ground water and surface water. A municipal water supply well is located about 1,500 feet from the site. Although it was not contaminated, the well was taken out of service in the early 1990s as a precautionary measure. It was brought back in service in the late 1990s as a supplemental public supply well to augment a newly installed supply well. Routine water-quality sampling has continued to show that this well is unaffected by the landfill. The former operator of the landfill and the Town of Tusten each own part of the property. Approximately 550 people live within 1 mile of the site. Six homes are located about 400 feet from the landfill. The Delaware River, classified by the National Park Service as a Wild and Scenic River, is located 450 feet from the landfill and is used for fishing and recreational activities.

The site was listed on the National Priorities List in 1986.

Site Responsibility: This site is being addressed through federal, state, and potentially responsible party actions.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed in a single long-term remedial phase to clean up the entire site.

In 1985, the State of New York signed an Administrative Order on Consent with a potentially responsible party (PRP), SCA Services, Inc., which had transported wastes to the site. The lead for the site was transferred from the State to EPA in 1990 and a new Administrative Order on Consent was signed with SCA. This new order required SCA to undertake a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine the nature and extent of the contamination at and emanating from the site and to identify and evaluate remedial alternatives. Based upon the results of the RI/FS, a Record of Decision (ROD), finalized in 1994, identified drum removal, capping of the landfill, and ground water extraction and treatment as the selected remedy.

Consent Decree negotiations between EPA and a group of twenty-eight PRPs to carry out the design and implementation of the remedy selected in the ROD were successfully completed in 1995; the Consent Decree was entered in U.S. District Court (approved by the Judge) in 1996. An Administrative Order on Consent was entered into with the Town of Tusten in 1995 for the Town to conduct a removal action. The Town of Tusten subsequently excavated and disposed of off-site, contaminated soil from two small septage lagoons south of the landfill and constructed a storm water management system around the landfill to reduce leachate production. During this effort, 300 drums filled with hazardous liquids, solids, and sludges were removed from an area adjacent to the septage lagoons. The drum removal component of the remedy, which was performed in 1996, resulted in the excavation and removal of more than 5,000 drums, three tractor trailer loads of hazardous sludge, and 50 dump trucks of contaminated soil. The construction of the cap component of the remedy was completed in 1998.

A downgradient groundwater perimeter study was completed in 2001. Soil cores were collected from beneath the landfill mass in 2004. In scoping the design of the ground water extraction and treatment system component of the 1994 ROD remedy, it was determined that there were logistical problems associated with space constraints related to equipment and infrastructure. There were also difficulties related to transmitting treated effluent from the envisioned groundwater treatment system either beneath the railroad embankment to the Delaware River or to ground water. In response to these concerns, and after the completion of the construction of the cap, the PRPs evaluated whether alternative remedial approaches for addressing the ground water would be more appropriate than the full-scale groundwater extraction-and-treatment system contemplated in the 1994 ROD. These efforts took the form of investigations, studies, and bench- and field-scale pilot testing, with EPA oversight. Early in this reassessment process, it became increasingly clear that there were additional, previously-unidentified source areas of chlorinated and non-chlorinated VOC nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contamination in soils beneath the above-mentioned former drum-disposal areas. The results of a subsequent 2001 shallow groundwater hot-spot investigation conducted along the downgradient perimeter of the landfill confirmed the potential presence of these source areas. A subsequent source-area investigation performed in 2004 clearly revealed the location of the primary, previously-undocumented source area. Characterization of the horizontal and vertical extent of this source area was conducted in 2007. The 1994 ROD estimated that capping the landfill, in combination with ground water extraction and treatment at the landfill and downgradient natural attenuation, would result in achieving the ground water cleanup goals in fourteen years. However, with the newly identified presence of a large NAPL source area, the cleanup time-frame estimate for that ground water remedy is now estimated to be 150 years. For this reason, new remedial alternatives were assessed in an updated FS. Based upon the findings of the updated FS, a ROD was signed in 2010. To address the new source area, the 2010 ROD called for air sparging the source areas to remove VOCs (injecting air directly into the contaminated liquid waste and surrounding groundwater to volatilize VOCs), soil vapor extraction (SVE) to collect and treat, as necessary, the vapors as a result of the air sparging, a final phase of air sparging/SVE where amendment/additions are introduced, and eventual application of in-situ chemical oxidation, if necessary, after a stabilization period. The ROD also included an amendment to the approach to address the ground water at the site, replacing the extraction and treatment system with natural attenuation of the ground water contamination. An Administrative Order on Consent for the remedial design of the source-area remedy was entered into by EPA and the PRP Group in l 2011.

Construction of the remedy was performed from 2012 to r 2013.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Based upon the results of downgradient groundwater samples, it appears that the air sparging/SVE system has reduced the VOCs to the point where natural attenuation will likely be effective. Accordingly, the air sparging/SVE system was taken offline in October 2017. Because subsequent monitoring data indicated that the performance standards have been met. Therefore, natural attenuation will be performed.

Five-year reviews are undertaken at sites to ensure that implemented remedies protect public health and the environment and that they function as intended by site decision documents. EPA issued five-year review reports in August 2001, August 2006, July 2011, and September 2016. The September 2016 five-year review concluded that the implemented actions at the site protect human health and the environment. The five-year review also concluded that, currently, there are no exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks and none are expected as long as the site use does not change and the engineered and access controls that are currently in place continue to be properly operated, monitored, and maintained. EPA will conduct another five-year review on or before September 2021.
