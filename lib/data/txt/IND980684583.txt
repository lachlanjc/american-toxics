Background
The 5-acre Poer Farm site is located north of Wilkinson, in Hancock County, Indiana. The site is an abandoned tract of land with a collapsed house and barn that have been vandalized. From 1973 to 1983, Norman Poer and Michael Coleman stored about 275 drums of waste solvents and paint resins on site. They had planned to blend these materials into paint for painting area bridges and barns. They abandoned the project and left the 55-gallon drums behind. A site inspection by EPA in 1983 found the drums were leaking and damaging surrounding vegetation. EPA led an emergency removal action, or short-term cleanup, to protect human health and the environment. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1991.

What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA’s emergency removal action took away all drummed wastes as well as six to eight inches of soil from the drum storage areas. EPA disposed of all solid and liquid wastes at off-site waste disposal facilities.After follow-up investigations, EPA determined that the removal action had eliminated the health threats posed by the site and that no further cleanup actions were necessary. EPA selected a “No Further Action” remedy for the site and took it off the NPL in 1991. EPA placed the site on the NPL in 1983.
