Background
The 44-acre Nease Chemical site is located near Salem in Columbiana County, Ohio. Between 1961 and 1973, Nease Chemical produced various chemical compounds, including household cleaning compounds, fire retardants and pesticides (most notably mirex, a probable human carcinogen). Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous substances. Surface water runoff also carried contamination into the Middle Fork of Little Beaver Creek (MFLBC), which is an important natural resource in the region. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal, state and PRP actions. The site’s long-term remedy includes in-place treatment of the two most-contaminated former ponds using soil mixing/air stripping and stabilization/solidification; capping and covering of the former ponds and contaminated soil; extraction and treatment of shallow groundwater; and long-term site management. Under EPA oversight, excavation and backfill of Feeder Creek and the creek and floodplain area is complete. The on-site solidification of waste ponds at is also complete.  EPA has completed soil excavations and backfill at on-site source areas. EPA will continue construction on the groundwater collection trench and multi-layer cap. A groundwater injection system also will be implemented following construction of the groundwater trench and cap.

What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA is conducting a five-year review of the Nease Chemical Superfund site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This is the first five-year review of this site. The review should be completed by the end of August. Top of Page
Emergency Response and Removal
Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. After Nease Chemical closed the facility in 1975, it drained ponds, removed 115 buried drums and 5,700 cubic yards of soil from two highly contaminated areas on site, and preliminarily assessed the nature and extent of contamination. More recently, removal actions included installation of a leachate collection and treatment system, sediment barriers and surface water diversion structures. Sediment studies confirmed the effectiveness of these removal actions until they are part of the site’s final, long-term remedy. The removal system remains in operation.
