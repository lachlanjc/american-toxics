### Background

The 340-acre Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station (4 Waste Areas) site is located on a peninsula 15 miles west of Seattle. Site activities have included torpedo maintenance, fuel storage, welding, painting, carpentry, plating and sheet metal work. Site activities and waste disposal practices contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. In the most recent review, EPA deferred protectiveness of the site’s remedy until additional information is obtained regarding one area – operable unit 2, Area 8. Additional information will be obtained by including analysis of 1, 4-dioxane in the site’s monitoring plan; developing a sediment and marine tissue sampling plan; sampling to generate new data; and further evaluating of potential sediment and marine tissue contamination and risk assessment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1990, the U.S. Navy entered into a Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) with EPA and the state to address site contamination. The site’s long-term remedy included demolition of the plating shop building; removal and disposal of contaminated soil and sediment; removal of underground storage tanks; long-term monitoring of groundwater, sediment and shellfish; institutional controls; and phytoremediation to treat contaminated landfill soil. Remedy construction took place between 1995 and 2000. Site monitoring is ongoing.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions included excavation of contaminated soil.
