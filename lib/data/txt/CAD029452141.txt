### Background

The 18-acre Selma Pressure Treating Company Superfund Site (Site) includes a four-acre wood treatment facility and a vineyard next to the Site where liquids from the facility were dumped. The Selma Pressure Treating Company was a wood treatment company that operated from 1936 to 1981 in Selma, Calif. The wood treatment activities contaminated the soil and groundwater with harmful chemicals including hexavalent chromium.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) added the Site to the Superfund programâ€™s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983. EPA has been cleaning up the soil and groundwater contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1988, EPA started soil cleanup at the Site. The soil remedy included excavation of contaminated soil, stabilization and storage of excavated soil, a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) asphalt cap, vegetative cap, and abandonment of six dry wells. EPA updated the soil remedy to include a more stringent cleanup standard for arsenic, a cleanup standard for pentachlorophenol (PCP) in soils, more areas requiring soil cleanup and documentation of compliance with federal regulations. The soil cleanup is complete and operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

The groundwater remedy for chromium and hexavalent chromium included:

- construction and operation of a groundwater extraction and treatment system to convert hexavalent chromium to trivalent chromium,
- disposal of treated and tested groundwater by reinjection into the groundwater aquifer, and
- disposal of sludge generated by the treatment process.

The groundwater extraction and treatment system began operating in 1998. In 2005, EPA updated the groundwater remedy to in-situ bioremediation. This groundwater remedy injects molasses into groundwater wells. The molasses promotes the growth of naturally occurring bacteria in the soil and groundwater. Then the bacteria convert hexavalent chromium into trivalent chromium, which is non-hazardous, less mobile and less soluble in water than hexavalent chromium.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA implemented soil and groundwater cleanup activities at the site. The soil remedy is complete and the landfill caps require ongoing maintenance.

The State of California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) is operating the in-situ bioremediation groundwater remedy.

EPA is conducting a groundwater investigation for the hexavalent chromium groundwater -area that extends south of the former wood treatment facility and Highway 99. EPA is investigating the chromium and hexavalent chromium groundwater contamination in order to improve the groundwater cleanup.

EPA has conducted multiple Five-Year Reviews of the soil remedy and groundwater remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies continue to protect public health and the environment, and function as intended. The 2016 Five-Year Review report concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. EPA will continue working on determing the extent of hexavalent chromium contamination in the groundwater, updating the groundwater remedy, sampling private groundwater wells, providing alternative drinking water if needed, and installing new monitoring wells.
