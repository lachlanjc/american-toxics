### Background

The Del Norte County Pesticide Storage site is located in Crescent City, California. It was a storage area for pesticide containers from local agricultural and forestry related industries. Wastes and rinse water were improperly disposed of in an unlined sump, resulting in contamination of soil and shallow groundwater. Excavation of soil and treatment of groundwater have finished. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2002. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing to ensure that the small area of contaminated groundwater drops to protective levels.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions. The State of California’s Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) and Del Norte County’s Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Branch, are actively involved in monitoring the remaining contamination.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. EPA will continue to evaluate the site every five years until protective cleanup objectives have been permanently achieved.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA excavated contaminated soils and operated a groundwater treatment system until 1997 when the target contaminant, dichloropropane (DCP), was contained and continued to decrease slowly over time. Monitoring will continue until levels of DCP are below the cleanup objective of 5 parts per billion (ppb).  

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2002.
