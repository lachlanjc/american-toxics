Background
The 100-acre Frontera Creek site consists of areas that lie east of the town of Junquito and extends to the creeks that enter into the Caribbean Sea, industrial properties adjacent to Frontera Creek, North and South Frontera Lagoons, and the Ciudad Cristiana Housing Development. From 1971 until 1981, various nearby industrial properties discharged industrial waste directly into Frontera Creek. The public became concerned about the creek's possible contamination in 1977, following the death of thirty cows that had grazed in the affected area. Subsequent investigations by the EPA and several local industries confirmed that contaminants, including mercury and the pesticide lindane, were present in the creek. Several industries were identified as contributing to site contamination. The Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board (PREQB) fined one of them, Technicon, for discharging mercury into the creek in 1978. The 500 residents of the housing development of Ciudad Cristiana, which was built along the creek in 1979, began to complain of health problems within a year after their arrival. Blood and urine samples of the residents, obtained by the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH), showed above-normal concentrations of mercury. In addition, investigations conducted by the PREQB found that soil in and near the development was contaminated with mercury. As a result, the Governor of Puerto Rico ordered an immediate permanent evacuation of the 500 residents of Ciudad Cristiana. Studies conducted by the EPA and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) concluded that the mercury levels were not high enough to warrant an immediate evacuation of the residents. However, the EPA proceeded with a full investigation of the Frontera Creek site because of the known contamination. Local residents used the lagoons for fishing and recreation; the fish and the shellfish caught there were important components of the local diet. Site Responsibility: This site was addressed through Federal and potentially responsible parties' actions. The Frontera Creek site is located in Humacao on the eastern coast of Puerto Rico. It includes Frontera Creek from east of Junquito Ward to its entry into the Caribbean Sea, 13 industrial properties next to the creek, the three Santa Teresa Lagoons and associated abandoned pump stations, and the Ciudad Cristiana housing development. Industrial properties nearby discharged wastes directly into Frontera Creek, contaminating soil and water with hazardous chemicals. To clean up the site, EPA removed contaminated soils and sediments from several areas. The cleanup finished in 1995. Under current conditions at the site, potential or actual human exposures are under control. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in December 1998.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
 The plan for investigating the site contamination, conducted by the potentially responsible parties, was approved by the EPA and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in 1986. The investigation was completed in 1991. EPA signed the Record of Decision for the site in September 1991 selecting excavation of the sediments in the Technicon ditch leading to Frontera Creek and also selected removing some soils on the Technicon property. Following site investigations, EPA dug up sediments from a ditch that leads to Frontera Creek and also removed some soils from a highly contaminated property. Excavated mercury-contaminated soils and sediments were disposed of off site. About 800 cubic yards of sediment and soils from one of the industrial facilities were dug up and disposed of. Remedial actions have been completed. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in December 1998.

What Is the Current Site Status?
This site was addressed in a single long-term remedial phase focusing on cleanup of the entire site. The remedial actions have been completed and the site was deleted from the National Priority List on December 29 , 1998.

Enforcement Information
An Administrative Order on Consent was signed by the potentially responsible parties in 1986, requiring them to perform an investigation of site contamination. The Consent Decree for the remedial action was signed by the responsible parties in May 1992 and entered in Federal District Court on October 8, 1993.
