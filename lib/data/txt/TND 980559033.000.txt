### Background

The Velsicol Chemical Corp. (Hardeman County) [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in Toone, Tennessee. It includes an area where Velsicol Chemical Corporation operated a landfill from 1964 to 1973.

In 1979, EPA identified groundwater contamination in private wells. The City of Toone connected residences and businesses to the public water supply.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1983 because of contaminated groundwater, soil, solid waste, air and surface water resulting from landfill operations.

By evaluating cleanup options, monitoring the site, placing institutional controls on affected properties, and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, the [Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC)](https://www.tn.gov/environment/about‐tdec‐home.html), and Velsicol Chemical Corporation, the site’s [potentially responsible party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

A water line connects nearby residences and businesses to the public water supply.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Velsicol Chemical Corporation, the site’s PRP, led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and TDEC. Velsicol conducted site cleanup activities until 2002. Velsicol entered into an Environmental Settlement Agreement in 2002 and created a Custodial Trust.

Site investigations and cleanup activities have focused on two areas, which EPA refers to as [operable units, or OUs](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#o).

- Operable Unit OU-1 - groundwater contamination
- Operable Unit OU-2 - contamination source control.

**1979**  
EPA identified groundwater contamination in private wells and the City of Toone connected residences and businesses to the public water supply. Contamination affected groundwater on site and off site.

**1991**  
The site’s long-term groundwater remedy, selected in 1991, included groundwater extraction and treatment; monitoring; institutional controls to prohibit groundwater use; maintaining the disposal area, including fences and the soil cover; and identifying and evaluating additional cleanup activities.

**1995**  
The site’s long-term remedy for OU-2, selected in 1995, included landfill upgrades, capping and monitoring.

**2005 - 2007**  
EPA conducted air sampling and assessed whether residents or workers might be at risk from harmful groundwater vapors in buildings. In 2007, EPA installed vapor mitigation systems in the crawl spaces of two homes to address vapor intrusion.

**2008**  
In 2008, EPA began a soil vapor extraction (SVE) pilot study for the southwest disposal area at the site. The results of the pilot study indicated that full-scale SVE is suitable as a cleanup option for OU-2.

Remedy performance evaluations found the groundwater treatment system was not containing groundwater and waste was leaching from the landfill and discharging to nearby surface water. EPA has suspended groundwater treatment and begun to evaluate alternative cleanup options to address groundwater contamination.

As of 2009, residents and businesses do not use groundwater impacted by the site as a drinking water source.

**2012**  
EPA updated the OU-2 remedy in September 2012. The updated remedy includes landfill cap extension with drainage improvements and SVE remedies for the site’s waste disposal area landfills (north, middle and south). EPA is electing to implement the updated OU-2 remedy before starting further work on evaluating and implementing the OU-1 groundwater remedy.

**2016**  
The OU2 cap construction with drainage improvements was completed in May of 2016.

**2017**  
Construction for the SVE component of the OU2 remedial action began March 2017.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s [fourth Five-Year Review,](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11018963) completed in 2016, found the cleanup for OU-1 and OU-2 is protective of human health, but not protective of the environment. In order for the remedies to be protective of the environment, the following actions need to be taken to insure protectiveness:

- complete SVE remedial actions for OU-2
- implement Institutional controls on remaining affected properties
- develop and implement an amended remedy for OU-1 groundwater.

Long-term monitoring of ground water, surface water, fish tissue and air is ongoing.

Remedial design efforts are underway for the OU-2 cap and SVE remedial actions. The contractor for the site’s Custodial Trust has completed the remedial design for the SVE system and cap construction and maintenance.

EPA continues to monitor indoor and outdoor air at the site.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

EPA has placed institutional controls on most properties to prohibit well drilling for drinking water purposes.

### Sampling and Monitoring

In 2005 and 2007, the EPA conducted air sampling and assessed whether residents or workers might be at risk from harmful ground water vapors in buildings. In 2007, the EPA installed vapor mitigation systems in the crawl spaces of two homes to address vapor intrusion. In 2008, the EPA initiated an air sampling program. Based upon this program, the EPA determined that that vapor intrusion did not pose a threat to residents and workers and that no additional homes would require indoor air vapor mitigation systems. The EPA continues to monitor indoor and outdoor air at the site.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRP to investigate and clean up the site. The PRP maintained responsibility for the site until 2002. In 2002, the EPA and the PRP entered into an Environmental Settlement Agreement, creating a Custodial Trust. When cleanup costs exceed available funding in the Custodial Trust, the EPA and TDEC will fund site activities.
