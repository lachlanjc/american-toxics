Background
The 4-acre Carter Lee Lumber Company site is located in Marion County, Indiana. Carter Lee Lumber Company acquired the site property in 1979 for lumber storage. Penn Central Corporation previously owned the site. From 1960 to 1973, several commercial and industrial waste hauling companies leased the property. Following site investigations, EPA determined that the human health risks posed by site contaminants did not warrant a federal response action.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site was addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA selected a “No Further Action” remedy for the site and took it off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1996.
