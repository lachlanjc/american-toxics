Background
The Behr Dayton Thermal System VOC Plume site is located northeast of the confluence of the Greater Miami and Mad rivers in Dayton, Ohio. MAHLE Behr Dayton Thermal Products LLC makes vehicle air conditioning and engine-cooling systems at the site. Chrysler Corporation owned and operated the facility from about 1937 to April 2002. Groundwater beneath the plant is contaminated with volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, including the solvent trichloroethene, or TCE. Polluted groundwater from beneath the plant has migrated underground primarily toward the south and southwest residential, commercial, and industrial areas of the neighborhood. Other facilities in the vicinity may have also contributed to the groundwater contamination. Site investigation, cleanup, and cleanup planning are ongoing.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
U.S. EPA first became involved in the site in 2006 when it initiated a removal action at the request of the Ohio EPA to address vapor intrusion threats from groundwater contamination. The site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) as a Superfund site in 2009. Several site cleanup milestones have already been achieved. In 2009 Behr Dayton Thermal Products LLC (now MAHLE Behr Dayton LLC) took over the ongoing operation, maintenance, and monitoring activities of vapor mitigation systems to prevent accumulation in businesses and homes of harmful vapors associated with the site. MAHLE Behr Dayton is also required to install any necessary additional vapor mitigation systems. These activities are ongoing. After U.S. EPA was unable to reach agreements with the site’s potentially responsible parties or PRPs to lead the site’s remedial investigation, the federal agency began the remedial investigation in late 2009. Site characterization activities began in the summer of 2010 and continued into 2017. For these investigations, EPA collected soil, groundwater, and soil vapor samples across the area. The remedial investigation at the site included studying potential source areas in and around several facilities. The investigation identified areas of concern outside of the original vapor sampling locations with potential vapor intrusion issues. These investigations are expected to continue until the groundwater is cleaned up. The remedial investigation report (PDF) (17303 pp, 297MB, About PDF) was completed in November 2017, and a focused feasibility study report (PDF) (106 pp, 17,9MB, About PDF) was completed in May 2018. Based on the focused feasibility study, U.S. EPA issued a proposed plan that was finalized in its 2019 Interim Record of Decision (PDF)(101pp, 12.48MB, About PDF)  to enhance cleanup of the groundwater contamination and reduce exposure from soil vapor at the site. EPA expects to complete a final feasibility study report and a clean-up plan for the entire site after interim cleanup actions are undertaken. On December 22, 2015, EPA had reached a legal agreement or Administrative Settlement and Order on Consent for Removal Action (PDF) (45pp, 1.72MB, About PDF) with MAHLE that requires MAHLE to install and operate a system involving air injection into groundwater with subsequent extraction of contaminant vapors in an area at the southern edge of MAHLE’s Dayton operation. This is the portion of the groundwater contaminant plume that has the most significant concentrations of contaminants. MAHLE began operating this system in January 2018. The cleanup under the interim ROD will significantly expand air sparging and soil vapor extraction (SVE) to treat groundwater throughout the core of the plume.

What Is the Current Site Status?
In accordance with the 2009 EPA order, MAHLE is monitoring, inspecting, and maintaining mitigation systems to prevent vapors associated with the site from accumulating at harmful levels in nearby houses and businesses. MAHLE is installing new mitigation systems in houses or buildings where vapors are found at harmful levels. See more in the Stay Updated, Get Involved section of this webpage. In 2024, contractors for the potentially responsible parties are conducting additional environmental investigations in the vapor intrusion area of potential concern (pdf) (1 pp, 1.83MB, About PDF)to gather necessary data to complete the design of the clean-up activities selected in EPA's 2019 Interim Record of Decision (pdf) (101 pp,11.9MB, About PDF). The planned cleanup involves: 
additional air sparging with soil vapor extraction (SVE) to treat groundwater throughout the core of the plume, and
vapor intrusion monitoring, mitigation, and maintenance. 
EPA will issue a proposal for cleaning up the remaining contamination at the site after gathering additional data. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Groundwater has been found to contain trichloroethene (TCE) as well as perchloroethylene (PCE). However, EPA has not found any groundwater wells in the contaminated area, and all properties are provided with municipal water. EPA has found indoor air in residences at the site containing TCE concentrations above health-based screening levels. Peoples exposures to this indoor air contamination is being alleviated with vapor abatement systems, though these investigations continue. Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
U.S. EPA collected soil, groundwater, and soil vapor samples across the area between 2010 and 2017 as part of the remedial investigation. A separate removal action continues that involves sampling of houses and businesses to determine if vapors associated with the site are accumulating at harmful levels in indoor air. As part of the groundwater treatment system operated at the MAHLE Behr Dayton LLC facility, groundwater and soil vapor are sampled regularly. Top of Page
Emergency Response and Removal
In 2007 and in response to a request for assistance from the Ohio EPA, U.S. EPA initiated a removal action to address harmful levels of contamination in the indoor air of buildings and residences resulting from the groundwater contamination at the site; a process called vapor intrusion. Starting in 2006 and continuing in 2007-2009, Chrysler and U.S. EPA conducted an extensive vapor intrusion investigation in the residential neighborhood south of the Behr plant which showed that nearly half of the homes in the downgradient community had indoor air with vapors from the site. Sub-slab and indoor air were sampled in at least 395 structures and a total of 204 (now over 250) sub-slab vapor abatement systems were installed and operated in the homes to reduce TCE levels in the indoor air to safe levels. In 2009 and in accordance with an EPA-issued legal order (PDF) (26pp, 1.34MB), Behr Dayton Thermal Products LLC (now MAHLE Behr Dayton LLC) took over the ongoing operation, maintenance, and monitoring activities to prevent vapors associated with the site from accumulating at harmful levels in businesses and homes. The order also requires installation of vapor mitigation systems, and MAHLE Behr Dayton continues to conduct all these activities. On December 22, 2015, EPA reached a legal agreement with MAHLE (PDF) (45pp, 1.65MB), that requires MAHLE to install and operate a system involving air injection into groundwater with subsequent extraction of contaminant vapors in an area at the southern edge of MAHLE’s Dayton operation. On the same day, EPA also issued an Action Memorandum (PDF) (71pp, 8.91MB) which serves as the agency's primary decision document authorizing and identifying the cleanup action under the Superfund Removal Program. MAHLE began operating this system in January 2018. More information on EPA’s Emergency Response and Removal website for the Behr Dayton Thermal Products VOC Plume Site. Top of Page
Enforcement Information
In 2009 and in accordance with an EPA-issued legal order (PDF) (26 pp, 1.34MB), Behr Dayton Thermal Products LLC (now MAHLE Behr Dayton LLC) was ordered to take over the ongoing operation, maintenance, and monitoring activities to prevent vapors associated with the site from accumulating at harmful levels in businesses and homes.  The order also requires installation of vapor mitigation systems, and MAHLE Behr Dayton continues to conduct all of these activities. On December 22, 2015, EPA reached a legal agreement with MAHLE (PDF) (45 pp, 1.65MB), that requires MAHLE to install and operate a system involving air injection into groundwater with subsequent extraction of contaminant vapors in an area at the southern edge of MAHLE’s Dayton operation. This is the portion of the groundwater contaminant plume that has the most significant concentrations of contaminants. In September of 2019, EPA issued an interim record of decision for additional groundwater clean-up work as well as expanded vapor intrusion sampling and mitigation, in accordance with Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA, commonly known as Superfund).  In September 2021, EPA entered into a legal agreement with MAHLE Behr Dayton Thermal LLC and Aramark Uniform and Career Apparel LLC to conduct the remedial design for the interim remedy selected by the 2019 Interim Record of Decision. Specifically, MAHLE and Aramark have agreed to design the groundwater treatment involving air sparging and soil vapor extraction as well as expand the vapor intrusion sampling at the site.
