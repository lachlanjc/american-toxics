### Background

The 30-acre Industrial Lane Site is located in Easton, Pennsylvania. This Site began as an unlined landfill in 1961. It was later taken over by the Chrin Brothers and operated as a permitted landfill until 1988. Groundwater contamination has been documented since 1980. Contaminants detected in groundwater at the Industrial Lane Site include the volatile organic compounds, vinyl chloride, trichloroethene, perchloroethene, and benzene from the former disposal activities. Past industrial uses that may have contributed to Site contamination include iron ore extraction and iron works operations. There is a permitted, lined landfill continuing to operate on top of and adjacent to the Site. This Site was proposed to the National Priorities List on September 8, 1983, and formally added to the list on September 21, 1984.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1983, the state and EPA conducted a water sampling program of private wells in the area and investigated the potential sources of groundwater contamination. Water service lines were installed in 1989, from the existing street water supply mains to the 24 residences with contaminated or threatened wells. The selected remedy for cleanup of the groundwater and the source of contamination is closure of the unlined municipal landfill, in accordance with state regulations, and cleanup of groundwater. The closure of the unlined landfill was completed in 1993.  
  
The pump and treat remedy for the contaminated groundwater was completed in 1996 and has been operating since June 1999. EPA is evaluating all data generated since the startup of the system to determine if it is operating adequately. The automated water level monitoring system was installed in June 2001. EPA deferred making a protectiveness statement in the 2013 Five-Year Review for the Site until additional information is available about the landfill cover and liner slide. Additional sampling determined that vapor intrusion is not occurring at an on-site building at unsafe levels. In December 2015, EPA issued a decision document called an Explanation of Significant Difference requiring institutional controls (IC) for the site. The covenant implementing the IC was recorded on September 2016. The landfill owners currently are operating under a state municipal landfill permit, with oversight by the state and EPA.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the Site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by Site decision documents. The most recent [2023 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2355122), concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2028.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Instituional Controls (ICs) are in placed on groundwater and soil. Additional information about the ICs are available in the [2023 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2355122) (pages 8-10)..
