### Background

The Brook Industrial Park, a 4 1/2-acre complex of light industries and warehouses, is located on the northern bank of the Raritan River in an industrialized area of Bound Brook. The site is flanked by railroads, and commercial and residential areas. The Industrial Park consists of three buildings, referred to as Stirling Center, Blue Spruce and National Metal. Industrial, chemical, and pesticide production and storage at the site began in 1971. Operations from various tenants were cited for poor housekeeping and waste disposal practices. As a result, contamination migrated into building basement materials, surrounding site soils and the site groundwater. Public wells within 3 miles of the site provide water to an estimated 290,000 people. The Raritan River, adjacent to the site, is used for recreational and commercial purposes.  
  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Environmental investigations found that the Blue Spruce building flooring, as well as soils in the basement, contained a wide variety of pesticides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and dioxin. The Stirling Center facility basement also was found to contain elevated levels of heavy metals. Within the National Metal Finishings facility, sampling results from a subsurface pit revealed heavy metals, VOCs, and inorganics. Outdoor soils around the Brook Industrial Park were found to be contaminated with pesticides, VOCs, and heavy metals. The site groundwater was found to contain elevated levels of VOCs and heavy metals.

On September 30, 1994, EPA selected a remedy for the site which included excavation and off-site treatment and disposal of contaminated soil; demolition and disposal/incineration of the contaminated portions of the Blue Spruce building; and extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater.

By 1999, the Blue Spruce building was demolished along with the removal and disposal of contaminated wood, brick and concrete, and soils from the basement of the building. All of the site's contaminated soils were excavated and disposed of by September 2006. Small residual amounts of contaminated soils were capped near the footers of the buildings where structural integrity would have been compromised if further soil were to be removed. In addition, a groundwater pump-and-treat system was installed and continues to operate today. This system is designed to capture and treat the site-related contaminated groundwater.

  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

All actions have been completed with the exception of the groundwater pumping and treatment which is on-going. Groundwater monitoring data results have indicated that the system is working as designed and the contaminant concentrations in the groundwater are stable and in most cases are decreasing.
