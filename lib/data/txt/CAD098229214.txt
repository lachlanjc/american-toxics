### Background

Alark Hard Chrome was a plating operation located on Main Street near Poplar Street in Riverside, California. It operated from 1971 to 1985. In 1982, Riverside County Health Department discovered soil contamination on site. The site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) were ordered to investigate the full extent of contamination at the site. All plating equipment and indoor storage tanks were removed from the site when the Riverside County District Attorney Office permanently closed Alark's operations in 1985. During the 1980s, site PRPs conducted investigations and in 1986 began an unauthorized removal of soil, which was stopped by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC). In 1990, DTSC took over the site investigation. In December 2000, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL). Site investigations and cleanup planning are ongoing.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site has been closed off. EPA completed an initial remedial investigation to define the extent of contamination. However, additional sampling is required to characterize the site fully; this data gaps analysis started in 2011. Once it is completed, EPA will begin looking at possible ways to clean up the soil and ground water contamination.
