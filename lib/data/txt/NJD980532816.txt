### Background

The Spence Farm site is located in Plumsted Township, New Jersey. Spence Farm was historically an agricultural area and woodland. From about 1961 to 1967, parts of the site were used for the dumping of hazardous wastes in drums, bulk and free-flowing liquid form. In 1980, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), with assistance from Ocean County Officials, identified Spence Farm as a hazardous waste site. Currently, most of the site is used for agricultural purposes. Some steeper-sloped, less-accessible areas remain woodland. After immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, and site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983.

Following immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, the site’s long-term remedy was put in place. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in March 1997.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Immediate Actions: In 1982, the State installed 16 monitoring wells for sampling of groundwater.  

Long-term Cleanup: EPA selected a remedy in the site’s 1984 Record of Decision (ROD) to clean up the site by: (1) removing all drums and laboratory wastes and disposing of them at a federally approved facility; (2) excavating contaminated soil and disposing of it at a federally approved facility; (3) installing a system to control sediment so contaminants do not migrate during excavation; and (4) monitoring the groundwater for five years to ensure the effectiveness of the cleanup.  

Morton International, the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP), completed the removal and disposal of drummed waste, laboratory waste and visibly contaminated soil to an approved facility, eliminating risks posed by exposure to these materials. Soil sampling after the cleanup identified residual polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in soil, prompting further action. The PRP removed the remaining contaminated soil between 1989 and 1994. In all, about 4,360 cubic yards of waste material and contaminated soil were excavated and disposed of off site. Groundwater sampling over a five-year period indicated that the groundwater is clean.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA deleted the site from the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in March 1997, after determining that all necessary cleanup actions had been taken.
