### Background

The 83-acre Pacific Sound Resources (PSR) site, formerly known as the Wyckoff West Seattle Wood Treating facility, is located on the south shore of Elliott Bay on Puget Sound in Seattle, Washington. A wood-treating facility operated at the site between 1909 and 1994. Wood-preserving operations used creosote, pentachlorophenol (PCP) and various metal-based solutions of copper, arsenic and zinc. Daily operations, as well as spills, leaks and storage of treated wood products resulted in soil and groundwater contamination. Direct discharge or disposal of process wastes and indirect transport were the most likely sources of contamination to the marine sediment.

Over half of the site is located in either intertidal (2 acres) or subtidal (56 acres) lands. Although residential areas are located within a mile of the site, surrounding areas are primarily commercial and industrial. The local population and industrial users obtain their drinking and production water from public supplies.

Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.  

EPA and USACE completed the second Five-Year Review in 2009. It concluded that follow-up work is warranted to ensure that the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

For cleanup, EPA divided the site into two areas, referred to as operable units, or OUs: the 25-acre upland OU and the 58-acre marine sediment OU. EPA selected the long-term remedy for both OUs in 1999. It included the placement of subtidal and intertidal caps over the 58-acre marine sediment OU, including placement of at least five feet of cap material in the intertidal zone; dredging and removal of contaminated sediment for off-site disposal; and removal of marine pilings for off-site disposal.

**Cleanup Progress**

Due to impending site redevelopment, the Port of Seattle completed several early cleanup actions at the upland OU between 1996 and 1998. The early actions included excavating and disposing of process wastes from beneath demolished structures; constructing an upland slurry wall and a low-permeability upland cap; excavating and removing the most contaminated source materials for off-site disposal; and installing a recovery trench on the inland side of the slurry wall to capture non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs).

Construction of the long-term remedy by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) finished in 2005. Additionally, independent of the long-term reedy, the Port of Seattle collected and disposed of 25 cubic yards of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated soil and sediment from the Longfellow Creek storm-sewer outfall, which runs through the site. This environmental work contributes to the effectiveness of the overall cleanup. The Port of Seattle is currently conducting operation and maintenance activities. The U.S. Coast Guard continues to implement the institutional controls necessary to protect subtidal areas from damage by improper anchorage.  

### Sampling and Monitoring

Groundwater and DNAPL monitoring is conducted periodically as part of the remaining non-construction remedial activities.
