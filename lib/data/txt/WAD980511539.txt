### Background

This 92-acre Hidden Valley Landfill site is located in Puyallup, Washington. A landfill and gravel pit began operating on site in 1967. Until 1985, the landfill accepted liquids, solids, industrial wastes and heavy metal sludge. Waste disposal activities contaminated groundwater with hazardous chemicals and heavy metals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included covering the waste with an impermeable barrier; collecting landfill gases; controlling surface water and soil erosion; minimizing the lateral and vertical movement of contaminated groundwater by reducing the production of leachate; and institutional controls. Remedy construction took place in 2000. Landfill gas and groundwater monitoring are ongoing.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions included modification of the landfill’s gas control system.
