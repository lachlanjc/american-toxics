### Background

**Current Status**

The EPA completed the Remedial Investigation/Feasiblility Study (RI/FS) for Operable Unit 01 Site Wide Ground Water on Septetmber 29, 2017. The Record of Decision documented the Agency's finding that the there was not an unacceptable risk to human health and the environment from the Site Wide Groundwater. EPA has completed work on the RI/FS for Operable Unit 02 Wetlands and Marine Habitat and has prepared a Proposed Plan for public notice and comment ifrom August 13, 2020 through September 12, 2020. EPA 's preferred remedial action is "No Further Action" based on the Remedial Investigation Report determination that Operable Unit 2 does not pose an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. EPA wil hold a virtual public meeting on August 27, 2020 to present its preferred remedial alternative of "No Further Action" for Operable Unit 2. EPA expects to issue a Record of Decision of the final remedial action selected for Operable Unit 2 in the fall/winter of 2020. EPA will prepare an RI/FS for Operable Unit 03 Soils after the completion of the items required by the Removal Action. The owner of the site is currently completing the items required by the Removal Action.

**Site Background**

The 104-acre Falcon Refinery site is located near Ingleside, Texas. An oil refinery previously operated at the site. When in operation, the refinery had a capacity of 40,000 barrels per day. Primary products consisted of naphtha, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel and fuel oil. The refinery also transferred and stored vinyl acetate. Refinery activities and waste disposal practices have contaminated the site with hazardous chemicals. Investigations are underway to assess the nature and extent of contamination and to explore appropriate cleanup options.

**National Priorities Listing (NPL) History**  
Proposal Date: September 5, 2002  
Final Listing Date: September 16, 2011  
Population: The population of the City of Ingleside is approximately 9,388.  
Setting: The Site consists of an abandoned refinery that has operated intermittently since 1980. When in operation, the refinery operated at 40,000 barrels per day capacity with primary products consisting of naphtha, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel, and fuel oil. The refinery processed material that consisted not only of crude oil but also hazardous substances. The Site is bordered by wetlands to the northeast and southeast, residential areas to the north and southwest, an abandoned refinery to the northwest, and a construction company to the southwest.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.

The site consists of a refinery that operated intermittently and is currently inactive, except for a crude oil storage operation. Surface water drainage from the site enters wetlands along the southeastern section of the abandoned refinery. The wetlands then connect to the Intracoastal Waterway and Redfish Bay, which connects Corpus Christi Bay to the Gulf of Mexico. Other portions of the site include aboveground and buried piping leading from the site to dock facilities.The site consists of a refinery that operated intermittently and is currently inactive, except for a crude oil storage operation.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 2004, the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP), National Oil Recovery Corporation (NORCO), entered into an administrative order on consent (AOC) with EPA. The PRP agreed to perform and finance a removal action and the site’s remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS). The removal action, or short-term cleanup, is ongoing to address wastes from abandoned tanks, equipment and piping. EPA took over the RI/FS after the PRP declared bankruptcy in 2011. EPA is in the process of performing the site’s RI/FS.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

### Sampling and Monitoring

EPA s will be collecting additional soil and groundwater samples when it conducts the RI/FS for OU 3. Past sampling conducted included soil, sediments and surface water in wetlands areas, surface water and sediments in the Intracoastal Canal, and sitewide groundwater.
