### Background

The 475-acre National Southwire Aluminum Co. [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) Site is located northwest of Hawesville, Kentucky. Part of a larger 1,100-acre property, the Site sits on the west bank of the Ohio River.

Southwire began operating an aluminum reduction facility at the Site in 1969. Facility operations and waste handling practices resulted in groundwater and soil contamination. In 1985, the EPA found contamination in drinking water wells at and near the Site.

In 2001, Southwire transferred ownership of the property. Century Aluminum of Kentucky, LLC currently owns the property. It continues to operate the aluminum reduction facility on-site.

The EPA placed the Site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1994 because of contaminated groundwater and soil resulting from facility operations and waste handling practices.

The EPA, the [Kentucky Division of Waste Management (KDWM)](http://dep.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx) and the Southwire Company (Southwire), the site’s [potentially responsible party (PRP),](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) investigated site conditions. By maintaining institutional controls on the site property and conducting operation and maintenance activities and required Five-Year Reviews, the EPA, KDWM and the site’s PRP continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

In 2011, the EPA determined that the PRP had successfully completed all required cleanup actions.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people working on or near the Site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Southwire, the Site’s PRP, led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by the EPA and KDWM.

**1992**  
Under KDWM supervision, the Site’s PRP removed contaminated soil from the site and disposed of it at an EPA-approved hazardous waste facility.

**1993**  
The EPA issued an [interim cleanup plan](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/12306.pdf). It included:

- building a groundwater pump-and-treat system
- discharging treated groundwater to the Ohio River through a state permit
- disposing of wastes generated by the pump-and-treat system following Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) requirements.

**1994**  
The EPA placed the Site on the National Priorities List (NPL) in May. In July, the EPA made modifications to the treated water discharge levels through an [Explanation of Significant Differences](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/10071249.pdf).

**1995**  
The PRP built a pump-and-treat system and began groundwater treatment. The system operated until 2010, when groundwater cleanup goals were met.

From 1995 to 1997, the PRP conducted a non-time-critical removal action to address contamination at a former waste disposal area and built a cap-and-cover system over the area.

**2000**  
The EPA issued a [final cleanup plan](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/10071251.pdf). It included:

- continued use of the groundwater pump-and-treat system
- monitoring groundwater and treatment system discharge
- digging up and disposing of highly contaminated materials at an off-site landfill
- placing materials with low-level contamination under a cap on Site
- collecting and treating leachate from the landfill on site
- placing institutional controls on the Site

**2007-2008**  
The PRP began cleanup activities in 2007, including digging up and removing contaminated soil to an off-site facility or placing it under caps on Site. Following construction of the caps, the PRP revegetated the capped areas. In 2008, the PRP completed cleanup of the site and fenced the area when cleanup requirements were met. The PRP also placed warning signs prohibiting digging in specific areas of the Site.

**2011**  
The EPA conducted a final inspection at the site and determined that the PRP had completed cleanup activities.

**2015**  
The EPA removed the Site from the National Priorities List.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA published the [most recent Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11166413) in 2021. The remedy for the National Southwire Aluminum Superfund site is protective of human health and the environment.

Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. The next Five-Year Review is scheduled to be completed in 2026.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The 2010 Environmental Covenant restricts groundwater and land use. It prohibits groundwater from potable use, prohibits residential land use, and prohibits disturbance of the cap system.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, the EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the Site’s PRP to investigate and clean up the Site. The PRP continues to fund Site monitoring and oversight activities.
