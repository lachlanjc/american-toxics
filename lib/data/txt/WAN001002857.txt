### Background

The Warmhouse Beach Dump Superfund Site is located within the Makah Indian Reservation at the northwest tip of the Olympic Peninsula in Clallam County, Washington. The site includes a former open dump on top of a ridge about three miles northwest of Neah Bay, and two streams that originate within the dump and flow to East Beach and Warmhouse Beach.

Municipal and household solid and hazardous wastes were disposed of at the dump from the 1970s until 2012 when the Makah Tribe began operating a solid waste transfer station on the reservation. Access to the 7-acre dump was then restricted by a locked gate on the unpaved road leading up to the dump, and signs were posted to discourage the community from entering the dump.

Elevated levels of metals, perchlorate and polychlorinated biphenyls ( [PCBs](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=PCB) ) have been found in soil at the dump and in sediment in both creeks.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Makah Tribe \[ [www.makah.com](http://www.makah.com) \] began monitoring surface water, sediment and groundwater around the dump in 2001. In 2009, the Tribe petitioned EPA to conduct environmental assessments of the Warmhouse Beach open dump due to concerns about hazardous substances leaching from the dump to the creeks and to traditionally significant shellfish beaches. EPA completed a Final Preliminary Site Assessment of the site in 2010, and a Hazard Ranking Systems Score was calculated in 2012.

The Warmhouse Beach Dump Site was added to the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) in December 2013.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA is in the early stages of the Superfund cleanup process, called the “Remedial Investigation.” During this stage, the EPA consolidates data previously collected from the site, determines if there are any data gaps, and collects any missing data. Since 2016, EPA, in coordination with the Makah Tribe, has conducted a number of sampling events in and around the Warmhouse Beach Dump. These events included the sampling of surface water and sediment from nearby creeks; soil within and next to the dump; and surface water, soil and sediment from areas that are not affected by the dump, called “background” areas. The most recent sampling event took place in June 2021, and included soil sampling in areas affected by the dump and not previously sampled.
