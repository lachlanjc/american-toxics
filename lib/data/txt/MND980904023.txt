### Background

The Adrian Municipal Well Field site is located in Adrian, Minnesota. EPA investigations identified nine separate leaking underground storage tanks as potential contamination sources. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1992.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal and state actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy is in place. In response to contaminated ground water findings, the State of Minnesota closed the city's two most highly contaminated wells and provided alternative water supplies to all affected residents. Two new municipal wells were installed outside the area of contamination and placed into operation in 1984 and 1985. In 1989, EPA transferred responsibility for the site to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), which completed site cleanup activities.

EPA placed the site on the NPL in 1986. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1992.
