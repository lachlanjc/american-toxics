### Background

The Mansfield Trail Dump site is in Byram Township, Sussex County, New Jersey. From the 1950s through the early 1970s, various parties used the site as a dump area for septic and industrial waste. The site is made up of wooded, undeveloped properties with formerly used disposal trenches (areas used for dumping waste). Contamination from the site has also impacted soil and groundwater in the nearby residential neighborhood.

The Sussex County Department of Health (DOH) and Human Services and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) detected [trichloroethene](https://www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca/risk-management-trichloroethylene-tce)  (TCE) in nearby drinking water wells in 2005. The TCE contamination traveled in the groundwater from the source area (i.e., waste disposal trenches) to nearby residential drinking water wells. They also detected  [cis-1,2-dichloroethene](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts87.pdf) (cis-1,2-DCE) and several other contaminants in the impacted residential wells. In 2005 and 2006, DOH and NJDEP sampled approximately 75 residential drinking water wells in the area and found contamination in some wells. Based on the results of these samples, NJDEP installed treatment systems in 19 residential wells to provide safe drinking water to the residents.

From 2006 - 2008, NJDEP evaluated whether contaminant vapors were getting inside homes, a concept called “vapor intrusion”. They detected contamination-related vapors in five homes, and installed sub-slab depressurization systems (SSDS) inside the five affected residences. These systems help direct hazardous vapors in the soil to the exterior of the building, protecting indoor air.

NJDEP continued investigating until 2009 when they discovered the waste disposal trenches as the major source of contamination. EPA further investigated these contamination source areas and installed additional monitoring wells in 2010. EPA listed the site on the National Priorities List (NPL) in March 2011.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**Initial Actions:** EPA collected water samples from monitoring wells and potable wells from residences, sub-slab soil samples and indoor air samples between 2011 and 2012. In 2012, EPA removed contaminated soil from the waste disposal trenches, ridding the site of the major source of contamination. Approximately 11,170 tons of non-hazardous waste and 383 tons of hazardous were removed and transported to CERCLA off-site approved disposal facilities meeting Resource Recovery and Response Act (RCRA) guidelines. After the completion of excavation activities the Site was re-graded and restored as close as possible to former conditions.

EPA also oversaw soil, groundwater, surface water (lakes and creeks) and sediment sampling from late summer 2013 through 2015. The results are incorporated in the May 2016 Revised [Data Evaluation Summary Report](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/395977.pdf) (DESR).

To help with the cleanup, EPA often divides Superfund sites into several distinct areas depending on the complexity and challenges presented. These areas, called operable units (OUs), may be geographic areas, specific site problems, or areas requiring a particular cleanup action.

The Mansfield Trail Dump site has two operable units.

The first operable unit (OU1) includes the contaminated drinking water wells for residential properties at the site. EPA documented its final cleanup plan for OU1 in the [2017 Record of Decision](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/528291.pdf) (ROD).

The second operable unit (OU2) addresses the contamination in and around the former waste disposal trenches (the source of contamination). It includes associated site-wide groundwater contamination, contaminated residential areas along Brookwood Road and Ross Road, and Cowboy Creek and Lubbers Run drainage areas.

EPA selected its preferred cleanup plan for OU2 in its [2019 ROD](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/541229.pdf) which addresses the site-wide contaminated groundwater, remaining soil contamination and related vapor intrusion.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is currently overseeing the engineering design work necessary to extend a waterline to connect impacted residential properties to clean municipal drinking water.

EPA oversaw soil investigation and soil vapor removal studies in spring 2021 in support of the preliminary design investigation (PDI) for the OU2 remedy.

EPA is continuing work to oversee the collection and evaluation of groundwater data to design treatment for the deep groundwater contamination.

Using funds provided through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, EPA will continue to design the waterline to impacted residents and remove soil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and lead from a residential yard located behind the former dump areas at the Mansfield Trail Dump Superfund site. EPA will dispose the contaminated soil at approved off-site facilities and then restore the excavated areas. EPA will also use the funds to complete the design of the distal contaminated groundwater plume cleanup.

EPA expects to finish the design for the treatment building and waterline extension in 2023 and begin constructing the treatment building and waterline extension in 2024 to connect the impacted homes on Brookwood Road and Ross Rd to the municipal water supply.

EPA will finish the pre-design investigation pilot studies to test soil and treat groundwater contamination near the Mansfield Bike Path in 2024.

### Sampling and Monitoring

There are five vapor intrusion mitigation systems currently operating at residential properties. These systems direct hazardous vapors in the impacted soil underlying the homes to the exterior of the building, and protect indoor air.

EPA conducts an annual inspection of the systems during the winter months.
