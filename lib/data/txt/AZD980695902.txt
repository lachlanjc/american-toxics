### Background

The 35-square-mile Phoenix-Goodyear Airport Area site is located in Goodyear, Arizona. Aircraft maintenance and military manufacturing activities contaminated the area with solvents and chromium. Cleanup activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**Initial Actions**

On-site solidification technology cleaned up the former sludge drying bed. Construction of this technology finished in 1993.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

**Remedy Selected**

*PGA-South:* The long-term remedy included extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater and soil vapor extraction for contaminated soils. EPA later updated the remedy to add air sparging in conjunction with the soil vapor extraction system and advanced affinity chromatography to remove chromium from groundwater.

*PGA-North:* The long-term remedy included a network of groundwater extraction and injection wells and a soil vapor extraction system with thermal oxidation and wet scrubbing. The soil vapor extraction system operated from 1994 to 1998, when EPA began to evaluate the need for its continued operation.

**Cleanup Ongoing**

*PGA-South:* The potentially responsible party (PRP) has cleaned up metal-contaminated soils, volatile organic compound (VOC)-contaminated soils and contaminated groundwater. The PRP shut down the final soil vapor extraction remedy in 2003. Soil vapor extraction removed about 2,300 pounds of VOCs. Cleanup has removed about 4,000 cubic yards of chromium-contaminated soils so far. The three groundwater remediation systems have removed about 3,300 pounds of VOCs and 2.8 pounds of chromium.

*PGA-North:* Groundwater treatment and soil vapor extraction activities have removed over 36,000 pounds of trichloroethylene (TCE). The PRP has constructed new treatment facilities which EPA expects will remove about 1,500 pounds of TCE per year when operating at full capacity. EPA expects to update the remedy to improve cleanup.
