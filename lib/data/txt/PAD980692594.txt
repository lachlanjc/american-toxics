### Background

The Paoli Rail Yard Superfund Site is located in Paoli, Chester County, Pennsylvania, in parts of Willistown and Tredyffrin Townships. The primary feature of the site is the 28-acre rail yard where electric rail cars were stored, maintained, and repaired for several decades through the 1980s. Dielectric fluids that contained polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), were handled and released at the rail yard. PCBs are a group of hazardous substances that were once widely used in dielectric fluids due to their excellent insulation capabilities. After release, the PCBs migrated to adjacent residential properties and streams located north of the rail yard. The site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List in August 1990.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In December 1985, EPA conducted a site evaluation and identified high concentrations of p olychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in surface soils at the rail yard and nearby residential properties. Sampling conducted in Valley Creek found PCBs in fish tissue at high levels. The rail yard contained no off-site migration controls and access to the rail yard was unrestricted to the public. Based on these factors, EPA conducted a removal response action, which was completed in 1988. The immediate risks were addressed by removing 700 tons of soil containing high concentrations of PCBs on portions of adjacent residential properties and constructing erosion control and surface water detention structures to prevent future off-property migration of PCBs.

EPA determined that the releases from the rail yard should be prioritized for detailed, long-term investigation. The site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) in August 1990. Following the remedial investigation, EPA selected the cleanup remedy in a July 1992 Record of Decision. The main components of the remedy were:

- Excavation of rail yard soils with PCB concentrations exceeding 25 parts per million (ppm);
- Stabilization of excavated rail yard soils in a lined containment cell with an impermeable cap located on the rail yard;
- Installation of erosion controls on the rail yard property;
- Deed restrictions on the rail yard property to protect the integrity of the remedy, prohibit residential and agricultural use and prohibit use of on-site groundwater for domestic purposes;
- Decontamination of buildings and structures on the rail yard property with high PCB concentrations;
- Excavation and treatment of PCB-contaminated soils on residential properties to achieve an average PCB concentration of 2 ppm for each individual property; placement of treated soils in the rail yard property containment cell;
- Extraction and treatment of ground water contaminated with fuel oil; discharge of treated ground water on site through a subsurface infiltration galley and offsite disposal of recovered fuel at an approved facility;
- Excavation and treatment of stream sediments along North Valley Creek, Hollow Creek, Cedar Hollow Creek, and Little Valley Creek and Valley Creek with PCB concentrations exceeding 1 ppm, with placement of treated sediments in the rail yard property containment cell; and
- Long-term groundwater monitoring.

Implementation of the remedy began soon after issuance of the Record of Decision. The remedial action included the excavation of an estimated 10,200 cubic yards of stream sediments and residential soils containing PCBs above cleanup standards and 28,000 cubic yards of soils from the rail yard, followed by treatment and disposal in the containment cell. Present-day notable features, constructed as part of the remedy in the rail yard, include the high retaining wall on the north side of West Central Avenue near the intersection with Cedar Hollow Road, the asphalt-paved area on the rail yard where PCBs remain in the soil, the lined containment cell where soils containing PCBs were stabilized and disposed, three sediment and stormwater detention basins, and chain-link fencing that entirely surrounds the rail yard.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The cleanup is being performed by potentially responsible parties (PRPs), in accordance with consent decrees between the parties and the United States. EPA provides oversight of the PRPs’ activities to ensure the cleanup is being performed as required.

**Non-Rail Yard Cleanup**

The non-rail yard cleanup includes restoration of stream sediments and residential properties. The stream sediments found to have been impacted historically by PCBs include those in the Cedar Hollow and Hollow Road tributaries and include portions of Little Valley Creek. The stream portion of the cleanup is designed to use the natural steep gradient to flush PCBs to an engineered basin located north of the Chester Valley Trail, where sediments are vacuumed out four times per year and after significant rain events. Annual sampling and monitoring in the past few years indicates residual concentrations of PCBs are limited to the tributaries. Sediments containing PCBs above the 1 part per million (ppm) cleanup standard have not been found in Little Valley Creek or Valley Creek. The stream cleanup also includes vegetative monitoring and maintenance of a restoration area located near the engineered basin and is on-going.

Assessment and restoration of residential properties is complete. The owners of those properties where PCBs were not present or found below an average concentration of 2 ppm were notified that cleanup was not required, and that their properties were suitable for unrestricted use and unlimited exposure. The owners of those properties where PCBs were found at or above an average concentration of 2 ppm or contained PCBs at any area above 10 ppm were notified of the need to have the soil removed.

**Rail Yard Cleanup**

The cleanup of the rail yard is complete. Inspection of the rail yard remedy components, including the containment cell cover, detention basins, gravel cover, asphalt cover, monitoring wells, and fencing occurs twice per year. Sampling and monitoring of groundwater also occurs twice per year. The performance standard for fuel oil recovery has been met and operation of the system is no longer required.

**Five-Year Reviews**

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent, [2021 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2314158), concluded that the cleanup remedy is protective of human health and the environment. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2026.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls are in place restricting groundwater use on the 28-acre Rail Yard property and prohibiting use of the Rail Yard property for residential and agricultural purposes. No institutional controls exist or are required for residential and commercial properties surrounding the Rail Yard property. Properties where contaminated soils could have existed were evaluated, and where necessary, remediated. These properties are suitable for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. More information about the institutional controls can be found in the [2021 Five-Year Review (page 5).](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2314158)

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions between 1986 and 1992 included installation of a fence, paving of a parking lot and high-use areas of the rail yard, removal of PCB-contaminated soil from residential properties, construction of a basin to prevent erosion of contaminated soil, removal of PCB-contaminated soil on the rail yard property, and installation of a fuel oil recovery system.
