### Background

The Oakdale Dump site is located in Oakdale, Minnesota. It includes three noncontiguous properties that served as dumps in the late 1940s and 1950s. The properties are the 55-acre Abresch site, the 5-acre Brockman site and the 2-acre Eberle site. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state, federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. The State of Minnesota has taken the primary lead for oversight of the project. EPA is serving as the support agency.  

The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires implementation of institutional controls.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included reconstruction or abandonment of impacted multi-aquifer wells, removal of containers and barrels of hazardous waste, removal and/or treatment of heavily contaminated soils in the Abresch and Brockman sites, removal and/or treatment of heavily contaminated soils in the Abresch and Brockman sites, and establishment of a long-term monitoring well network. In 1984, abandonment of multi-aquifer wells finished. In 1985, initial construction of the groundwater extraction system finished. Updates to the system took place in 2003. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions in 1982 disposed of a total of 11,500 cubic yards of waste material, including 4,200 empty drums, 8,700 empty 5-gallon pails, 4,660 cubic yards of contaminated soil, and 15 intact, overpacked containers. Excavated soils with low levels of contamination received on-site treatment. Around 173,000 gallons of contaminated water received off-site treatment.
