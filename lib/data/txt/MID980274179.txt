Background
The 3.5-acre Carter Industrials site is located in Detroit, Michigan. From 1966 to 1986, the facility supported storage and salvage operations. Spills, runoff and wind-blown dust contaminated soil and debris, about 1.25 miles of combined sewers, and several commercial, public and residential properties next to the site. People and vehicles also tracked contaminants into the neighborhood. The cleanup achieved standards safe for residential use, and EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1997.
