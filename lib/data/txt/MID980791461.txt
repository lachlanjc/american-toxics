Background
The 435-acre Avenue “E” Ground Water Contamination site is located in Grand Traverse County, Michigan. The United States Department of the Navy (Navy) initially operated an Air Station at the site beginning in 1943, until the United States Coast Guard (USCG) assumed control in 1945. In the maintenance and servicing of aircraft, the USCG and the Navy routinely used oils, lubricants, paints, paint stripping solvents, aviation gasoline and dry cleaning solvents. Direct dumping, chemical spills and storage leaks contaminated groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities were completed. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2007.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site’s long-term remedy included installation of two blocking wells to pump groundwater and prevent further contamination from leaving the property. Once treated, the groundwater discharges to the Traverse City sanitary sewer system. Construction of the remedy took place in 1985. Additionally, residences in the affected area received connections to a public water supply line. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2007.
