### Background

The Nelson Tunnel/Commodore Waste Rock Pile Superfund site is about one mile north of Creede, Mineral County, Colorado. At the abandoned hard rock mine site, the Nelson Tunnel discharges acid mine drainage directly into West Willow Creek. The site also included an unstable waste rock pile that is part of the Commodore Mine. These features add contaminants to surface water.

South of the site, West Willow Creek joins East Willow Creek to form Willow Creek. Willow Creek is a tributary of the Rio Grande River, a state-designated Gold Medal fishery. Historically, mining of silver, lead, and zinc provided economic benefits to the area in and around the Creede mining district.

Contaminants of concern are cadmium and zinc. The concentration of these chemicals in Willow Creek are higher than the State of Colorado surface water quality standards. Sources other than the Nelson Tunnel discharge may also be adding metal in West Willow and Willow creeks. These other sources include the Commodore Waste Rock Pile, sources on East Willow Creek and other tailings in the floodplain south of town. The EPA’s data shows that cadmium and zinc concentrations in the Rio Grande River downstream of the confluence with Willow Creek are more than current Colorado surface water quality standards.

The site has two parts, called operable units (OUs). Operable Unit 1 (OU1) is the Commodore Waste Rock Pile and Operable Unit 2 (OU2) is the draining adit of the Nelson Tunnel.

EPA conducted a removal action to stabilize the Commodore Waste Rock Pile (OU1) after a washout occurred in 2005. The Commodore Waste Rock Pile was graded and shaped to make stable slopes, mine waste was removed from West Willow Creek, and the EPA build about 2,000 feet of reinforced channel for the creek.

The site was added to the National Priorities List (Superfund) in September 2008. In 2008 and 2009, EPA did a removal work to stabilize the Commodore Rock Pile.

**Mining History**

In 1889, a party of prospectors, including Nicholas C. Creede, located the Holy Moses vein in the East Willow Creek drainage. The vein was extremely rich in silver. Prospecting increased in this area and in West Willow Creek. Two claims were staked up West Willow Creek, the Last Chance and the Amethyst mines, which would become the richest, most profitable mines in the Creede Mining District. Creede was one of the last silver boom towns in Colorado. Mining lasted nearly 100 years with the last mine closing in 1985.

Since mining has moved out of the area, tourism and recreation have become the town's economic backbone. Fishing in the Rio Grande River is an important part of recreation for visitors and locals.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Contamination of Willow Creek and its tributaries by mining related work and waste has been documented for more than 35 years. In 1999, the Willow Creek Reclamation Committee (WCRC) was formed by Creede community members to investigate the contamination in the watershed. Since then, the WCRC and the State, along with other partners and donors, have used EPA grants to do several cleanup projects in the watershed, stabilizing mine waste and tailings piles. The EPA grants are called non-point source funds and Brownfields. Despite this work, the Nelson Tunnel portal discharge has been found to be the largest single source of contamination in Willow Creek.

**2000–2007:** The WCRC and DRMS investigated and fixed portions of the Commodore Mine area. During this period, they learned a lot about mine conditions, sources of water flowing into the mine, and the possibility of water control measures. Rehabilitation work included stabilization, cleanup, and improvements to ventilation. Investigations included inspections, historical research, tritium dating of mine waters, and a dewatering pump test study in 2007.

**2008–2010:** The EPA did a removal action to stabilize the Commodore Waste Rock Pile (OU1) after a washout occurred in 2005. The EPA graded and shaped the pile to make stable slopes, removed mine waste from West Willow Creek, and built about 2,000 feet of reinforced channel for the creek.

The site was placed on the EPA’s National Priorities List in September 2008 because of the Nelson Tunnel discharge impact on water quality in Willow Creek and the Rio Grande River.

**2011–2019:** The EPA did a Remedial Investigation (RI) that was published in 2011. The RI included:

- a human health risk assessment
- an ecological risk assessment
- sampling data for West Willow Creek and Willow Creek
- a description of blockages within the Nelson Tunnel

As work continued on the sitewide Feasibility Study, further investigations were done on possible hydrologic control remedy alternatives. The EPA and DRMS found the need for an interim action to stop the potential hydraulic hazards connected with the mine pools in the Nelson Tunnel. A RI addendum was released in 2019 summarizing data from additional studies since 2011.

**2017–2019:** The EPA began developing a draft Focused Feasibility Study in 2017. The Focused Feasibility Study contains a detailed discussion of the Nelson Tunnel and the Commodore 5 level conditions, including a summary of an underground field visit in 2016 and a technical memorandum from DRMS regarding mine pool observations. The Focused Feasibility Study was given to the public with this proposed plan.

**2018–2022:** Site inspections in recent years showed that conditions in the mine complex required more immediate attention. So, extensive rehabilitation of the Commodore 5 level and some associated drifts was finished during the 2018–2020 Time-Critical Removal Action (TCRA), with additional work planned for 2021.

The rehabilitation work provides for medium-term (15- to 50-year design life) access for on-going inspection and characterization of conditions behind known blockages in the Nelson Tunnel. Once complete, rehabilitation will extend approximately 6,500 feet into the Commodore 5 portal, including shoring up openings and upgrading ladders to access the Nelson Tunnel.

In addition to maintaining access, the TCRA rehabilitation of the Commodore 5 level helps stop the buildup of pressure against the blockage (No Name Blockage) that creates the Upper Mine Pool. Pressure relief is provided when Upper Mine Pool water flows into the Commodore 5 level through the Del Monte Raise, into No Name Blockage, and returns to the Nelson Tunnel level through the No Name Winze, which is outby of No Name Blockage. This is an important aspect of the TCRA rehabilitation work, because if further collapses in Commodore 5 level prevent water from bypassing No Name Blockage and returning to the Nelson Tunnel level, a buildup of pressure in the Upper Mine Pool could potentially result in a blowout of No Name Blockage. This could result in a large, uncontrolled release of mining-impacted water from Nelson Tunnel. The TCRA was completed in 2022.

**2023-2024:** In 2023, the drill pad was completed and horizontal drilling for the interim remedial design was done to collect information for the proposed bypass adit.

In 2024, EPA and partner agencies are working on the interim remedial design (bulkhead in Nelson Tunnel to control sudden large releases of contaminated water) and treatability studies (drilling and pump tests) for the final remedy.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA is currently in the remedial design phase for the interim remedial action of putting in a flow-through bulkhead in the Nelson Tunnel. This would help prevent a sudden, large release of water from the Nelson Tunnel draining adit. At the same time, the EPA is working with the State of Colorado and the U.S. Forest Service on sampling and studies for the final remedial action at the Site.

Pre-design investigations include drilling/rock coring (for bypass adit design parameters), water treatment options (during construction of bulkhead), and other prep work for the interim remedial action.

The interim remedial design will go through 3 phases:

- conceptual design,
- intermediate design, and
- final design.

The EPA will hold meetings to discuss each phase. Additionally, the EPA is working with USGS on underground sampling and EPA consultants will be sampling surface water and groundwater to fully study the site and to improve the conceptual site model.

For the final remedial action at the site, EPA will develop alternatives along with the State of Colorado and the U.S. Forest Service.

Alternatives for final remedial action could include:

- source control (route water to keep clean water clean)
- semi-passive water treatment
- active water treatment

Treatability studies will be conducted in the next few years to further assess the feasibility of these options.

### Sampling and Monitoring

EPA is sampling surface water in the Willow Creek watershed four times a year. Sampling goals have included:

- Identifying the impact of the Nelson Tunnel and the Commodore Waste Rock pile compared to other loading sources outside of the Superfund boundary
- Studying how high and low flow (seasonal) water quality conditions compare to the state water quality standards
- Getting baseline conditions to compare with conditions after a future remedy is finished

Monitoring wells were installed in the fall of 2013 in the Commodore Waste Rock Pile, to investigate possible metals coming from the waste rock pile into the surface water. Another well was put in near the confluence of East and West Willow Creeks to study what things are like downstream. These locations are sampled four times a year along with the surface water sampling.

### Emergency Response and Removal

EPA is worried about the possibility that the flowing water from the mine could back up and suddenly release from the Nelson Tunnel into the Commodore Level 5 Tunnel.

To address this possibility, the EPA started a time-critical removal action to stabilize parts of the Commodore Level 5 Tunnel and parts of the Nelson Tunnel that connect to Commodore. The goals are to keep things from getting worse and stopping more pressure from building on the Nelson Tunnel impoundments.
