### Background

The 20-acre Jennison-Wright Corporation site is located in Granite City, Illinois. Various industrial operations began at the site prior to 1920 and continued until 1989. Waste piles, spills and poor storage practices led to soil and groundwater contamination. Following several short-term cleanup actions to protect human health and the environment from 1992 to 2003, the site’s long-term remedy was put in place. Groundwater treatment and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state and federal actions. Illinois EPA is the lead agency for site cleanup actions. EPA is the support agency.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA selected the site’s long-term remedy in 1999 and updated it in 2005 and 2009. The final remedy included off-site disposal of various site wastes and soil at a hazardous waste disposal facility, steam injection/concentrated contaminant recovery to address groundwater, and subsurface injections to address less-contaminated groundwater.

Cleanup of the northern part of the site finished in 2005. Cleanup of the site’s southern area followed, and included removal of dioxin-contaminated soils, excavation of the Jennite Pit and the 22nd Street Lagoon, completion of the Area H cleanup, excavation and disposal of soils in the former PCP process area; additional subsurface injections to help break down groundwater contaminants; and construction of a treatment system. The treatment system includes use of hot water injection wells to remove non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPL) from groundwater.

The 2009 updates to the remedy included the need for institutional controls to restrict future use of site soils and groundwater, excavation of contaminated soil from beneath 22nd Street, and a contingency plan for addressing potential additional contamination below the Jennite Pit. The site achieved construction completion status in September 2009. The groundwater/NAPL treatment system will continue running for several years. Groundwater monitoring takes place quarterly to ensure the effectiveness of the remedy.  

The site has remained vacant since 1990.  

### Sampling and Monitoring

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions by Illinois EPA from 1992 to 2003 stabilized site contaminants, removed the most-critical materials, and demolished on-site structures and removed additional surface contamination.
