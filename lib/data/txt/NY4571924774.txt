### Background

The 3,440-acre former Plattsburgh Air Force Base is located in Plattsburgh, New York. The site is located in a mixed use area consisting of industrial and commercial businesses, as well as private residences. It is bordered on the north by the Saranac River and the city of Plattsburgh, and on the south by the Salmon River. Lake Champlain, located east of the base, forms approximately one mile of the base boundary.

The base began operations in 1955 as a Tactical Wing under the Strategic Air Command of the United States Air Force. It continued operations under that mission until 1991, when it was reassigned as an Air Refueling Wing. The base closed under the Department of Defense (DoD) Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) program in 1995. Before the Air Force Base was built, the area occupied by the former base was used by various components of the U.S. military dating back to the Civil War. A history of the site is available on the [Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corporation’s (PARC’s) website](http://www.parc-usa.com).

The site became contaminated as a result of the various activities conducted at an operating Air Force base. Hazardous wastes were generated from base activities including aircraft operation, testing and maintenance, firefighting exercises, the discharge of munitions, and landfill operations. Spills and releases of hazardous wastes from these activities contaminated groundwater, soil, surface water, and sediment at a number of areas at the base. Cleanup has been ongoing since the 1980’s and is nearly complete. Under current conditions at the site, potential or actual human exposures are under control.

EPA became involved with the site during the 1980’s after the Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies and departments began examining the potential release of hazardous wastes at their facilities. Initial sampling conducted by the Air Force in 1987 revealed the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in shallow groundwater monitoring wells down-gradient of the base hazardous materials storage area. These results, as well as sampling results from a number of other areas at the base, caused EPA to place the site on the Superfund Program’s National Priorities List in November 1989. A Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) governing the identification, investigation, and cleanup of hazardous wastes at the base was signed by the Air Force, EPA, and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) in 1991. Under this agreement, the Air Force conducts hazardous waste investigations and cleanups under its Installation Restoration Program (IRP) as the lead agency, with oversight by EPA, NYSDEC, and more recently the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH).

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

PFAS are a major component of Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF) that was used and stored by the Air Force from 1970 until the base closed for fire-fighting purposes. Recent studies have linked PFAS to several types of cancer, including thyroid and kidney. As a result, EPA issued a Health Advisory Level (HAL) for two PFAS compounds in drinking water. The two compounds are Perfluorooctanyl Sulfate (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA). The EPA Health Advisory Level is 70 parts per trillion (ppt) total combined PFOS and PFOA in drinking water. In addition, NYSDEC recently set a drinking water standard (Maximum Contaminant Level) of 10 ppt for PFOA and PFOS. In March 2023, EPA proposed a MCL of 4.0 part per trillion (ppt) (also expressed as ng/L) each for PFOA and PFOS. For more information: [Proposed PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation](https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas).

Because AFFF was used extensively across Plattsburgh AFB for nearly 30 years, the Air Force began studies to look for PFAS at the base in 2014. The Air Force conducted a Site Investigation (SI) of the base fire training area site in 2015 and tested for PFAS in soil, groundwater, surface water, and sediment at and downstream of the site. PFAS were detected in the soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment. PFAS were detected in groundwater and surface water samples above the Health Advisory Level set by EPA for drinking water.The Air Force conducted a base-wide Preliminary Assessment in 2015 to identify other potential areas where AFFF was used and stored at the base for further sampling investigations. This assessment identified 10 additional areas for investigation, which included aircraft crash and fire areas, AFFF storage and testing areas, fuel spill areas, and receiving surface water bodies. The Air Force conducted a base-wide Site Inspection (SI) for AFFF for these 10 sites in 2016-2017. The SI was limited to determining the presence or absence of AFFF/PFAS at the former base.

The Air Force also contacted over 300 potential off-base groundwater users within one mile of the base boundary, beginning in 2015. The Air Force ultimately identified fifty-three private groundwater wells in its well survey. The Air Force began sampling these wells shortly after each well or group of wells were identified. PFAS were detected at a numer of residences. At four of these residences, the combined total PFOA and PFOS detected was above or close to the EPA Health Advisory Level. The Air Force immediately provided bottled water to the four residences and subsequently installed in-home granulated activated carbon (GAC) treatment systems at three of them. Installing a GAC system was not possible at the fourth residence, which continues to receive bottled water from the Air Force. The Air Force regularly samples these drinking water wells and operates and maintains the treament systems to ensure that the treated drinking water is safe. The Air Force submitted a final well survey and sampling report in November 2018 and it was approved by EPA in December 2018.

In 2018, the Air Force began an expanded Site Investigation for PFAS. The purpose of the expanded investigation was to conduct additional on- and off-base groundwater sampling to determine whether or not there is a link between the on-base and off-base PFAS contamination. The Air Force began field work in December 2018. The Air Force submitted the first data report to EPA and NYSDEC in May 2019. The Air Force conducted additional sampling in 2019 and 2020, and the Air Force submitted a report of findings to EPA and NYSDEC.

The Air Force eventually plans to conduct a comprehensive study (Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study) to determine the nature and extent of PFAS contamination on and off the former base, starting in 2021. The study will include human health and ecological risk assessments. The Air Force submitted a draft work plan for the Remedial Investigation in April 2021. EPA and NYSDEC reviewed the work plan and submitted comments. The Air Force is currently revising the plan. The Air Force will propose a cleanup plan to address PFAS at the site after the study is completed and cleanup options are evaluated.

**Other Ongoing Site Investigations and Cleanups:**

[**Fifth Five-Year Review Report for the Former Plattsburgh Air Force Base**](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/585828.pdf)

Unburned jet fuel and waste solvents used during activities at the Fire Training Area contaminated soil and groundwater, which resulted in a groundwater plume containing fuel-related compounds and chlorinated solvents. A plume is an area where contaminants are dispersed in groundwater. The chlorinated solvent portion of the groundwater plume extended across the base and was over one mile in length before the start of cleanup activities, reaching within 2000 feet of Lake Champlain. The fuel-related portion extended approximately 2,500 ft. across the base. During various periods of operation, the base used four unlined landfills to dispose of household wastes and construction debris. Hazardous wastes may have been dumped in the landfills. Contaminated liquids (leachate) from two of the landfills contained volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including fuel-related compounds, and pesticides. VOC contamination was also detected in groundwater down-gradient of the landfills. As a result of leaking drums used to store pesticides at the site, DDT was found in soil at the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) storage/maintenance area. Spilled solvents that were used at the Building 2774 and Heavy Equipment Maintenance Facilities contaminated soil and groundwater with dichlorobenzene, trichloroethene (TCE) and other VOCs. A failed underground storage tank (UST) that was used to store waste solvents at the Nose Dock 8 Facility resulted in soil and groundwater contaminated with chlorinated solvents. Operations at a number of other sites at the former base produced additional areas of contamination.

Previous and ongoing investigation and cleanup efforts at the base protect human health and the environment in a number of ways. All of the contaminated areas have either been cleaned up or have cleanup plans (including institutional controls) in place.

Since 1991, EPA has conducted oversight of the investigation and, when required, cleanup, at over 60 sites at the base. EPA has reviewed, provided comments on, and ultimately approved several hundred technical documents including Preliminary Assessments (PAs), Site Investigations (SIs), Remedial Investigations (RIs), Feasibility Studies (FS’s), Treatability Studies, and Removal Actions. EPA has also reviewed and approved cleanup plans, called Records of Decision (RODs), for 20 major sites at the base known as Operable Units (OUs). RODs are issued by the Air Force in conjunction with EPA and are signed by both agencies. NYSDEC issues a concurrence letter on each ROD; the agreement of all three agencies is required for a ROD to become final. The RODs are legal documents that explain which cleanup alternatives will be used at the site. Before a ROD is issued, a Proposed Plan is released for public comment. The Proposed Plans, which present the cleanup alternatives that were considered and the preferred cleanup option, are developed by the Air Force, with review and comment by EPA and NYSDEC. The Proposed Plans include a minimum 30-day public comment period and require EPA and NYSDEC approval before being released to the public.

EPA has also been responsible for reviewing, comment on, and approving all property lease and transfer documents for the former base. The Base Realignment and Closure Program calls for returning all base property to the local community. Federal regulations require that all contaminated federal property be cleaned up prior to transfer, while allowing for exceptions if certain conditions are met. This process began with the Air Force developing a Base-Wide Environmental Baseline Survey, which identified over 1200 environmental factors at the base which could affect the lease and/or transfer of various base properties. EPA reviewed and commented on several versions of this document, which ultimately resulted in the identification of sites which could be leased and/or transferred outright, and those in need of additional investigation and/or cleanup before lease or transfer. Early in the base closure process, in order to expedite reuse by the community, most of the initial properties were leased. Before leasing a property, the Air Force developed a series of documents that required EPA and NYSDEC approval before the property could be transferred to outside parties. As much of the contamination at the base was cleaned up, only a small number of areas remained with contaminated property where cleanups were not complete. The Air Force was able to transfer these properties through the early transfer process which required additional approvals by EPA’s Regional Administrator and the Governor of New York State. The documents associated with these transfers contain legally binding language that requires the Air Force to continue the site cleanups until they are completed to EPA and NYSDEC's approval. They also contain restrictions in the form of institutional controls placed in the deed for transfer that will protect human health and the environment until site cleanup is complete.

All Air Force property at the former base intended for transfer to outside parties has already been transferred. Before transferring former Air Force property to outside parties, the Air Force had to place a covenant in the deed that documented that all necessary cleanup actions had been taken before the date of transfer. The property investigation and transfer documents, along with the Air Force covenant, provide strong assurance to the public and new land owners that human health and the environment are protected. In the case of early transfers, the assurances made by the Air Force in the property deeds, along with the approval of the EPA’s Regional Administrator and the Governor of New York State, also provide strong assurance to the public and new land owners that human health and the environment are protected.

Land Use Controls / Institutional Controls (LUC/ICs) were placed in property deeds before transfer to outside parties for all sites where contamination remained at the time of transfer. Institutional Controls are administrative or legal controls, like deed restrictions, that are put in place to restrict activities at a site. The purpose of these controls is to help minimize the potential for people to be exposed to contamination and/or to protect the integrity of a cleanup remedy. These types of controls vary by site but can include restrictions on groundwater withdrawal and discharge, type of land use (e.g., restriction to non-residential uses), and any activities that would interfere with cleanup operations, ICs related to Soil Vapor Intrusion, and granting property access to the Air Force and regulatory agencies at sites where contamination remains. Annual inspections are conducted by the Air Force to ensure that property owners are compleying with these restrictions. Land owners must also self-certify their compliance via a written checklist. The Air Force compiles the results of their inspections and the land owner’s self-certifications into annual reports which are submitted to the regulatory agencies for review. Any violations are then addressed by the Air Force and regulatory agencies. LUC/ICs remain in place until properties are cleaned up, and can only be removed with EPA and NYSDEC approval. Additional Institutional Controls include access restrictions, such as fencing, locked gates, and signs. These are mainly used at areas where cleanup/treatment systems are still operational, including the former base landfills and the Fire Training Area.

The Air Force is responsible for investigating any additional contamination that is found, and for cleanup if it is determined to be caused by the Air Force.

EPA is also responsible for reviewing, commenting on, and approving Five-Year Reviews conducted by the Air Force for Plattsburgh AFB. The purpose of five-year reviews is to ensure that implemented cleanup plans at Superfund sites function as intended and continue to protect human health and the environment. These regular reviews are required by federal law when contaminants remain at a site. To date, five of these reviews have been conducted, with the most recent Five-Year Review Report completed in November 2019. Based on comments and recommendations made by EPA and incorporated by the Air Force into the reports, EPA has approved the protectiveness of all cleanup actions at the base.

EPA also reviews Operation and Maintenance Reports submitted periodically by the Air Force for the operation of all cleanup/treatment systems. This helps the Air Force to ensure that the systems are operating safely, properly, and efficiently.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

**PFAS (PFOS and PFOA) Recent and Future Planned Response Actions and Investigations at the former Plattsburgh AFB**

Response actions and investigations for the emerging contaminants known as per- and polyfluroalkyl substances (PFAS) are currently ongoing at the former base.

**Municipal Water Line Extension:** The Air Force plans to extend a portion of the Plattsburgh municipal water line to three off-base residences that currently use private drinking water wells. Previous Air Force sampling of the wells found PFAS (combined total of PFOA and PFOS) near or above EPA's Health Advisory Level at the tme of 70 parts per trillion (ppt). The Air Force installed granular activated carbon (GAC) point of entry treatment (POET) systems at two of the residences shortly after the testing results were received. The Air Force provided bottled water to the third residence because it was not feasible to install a POET system there. These three residences are located a short distance from an existing municipal water line. The Air Force conducted an Engineering Evaluation / Cost Analysis to evaluate potential response actions to address the situation long-term. EPA and NYSDEC reviewed and commented on the draft Engineering Evaluation / Cost Analysis Report, and eventually approved the final Report. The Air Force held a public comment period on the Report in September 2022, and no comments were received from the public. The Air Force's legal department is currently reviewing the internal draft Action Memo to extend the municipal water line. Once the draft Action Memo is completed it will be submitted to EPA and NYSDEC for review and comment.

The Air Force also installed a POET system at a fourth off-base residence with combined PFOS/PFOA above 70 ppt in its drinking water well. Because this residence is not located near any existing municipal water lines, the Air Force plans to continue to test, operate and maintain this system.

**NYSDEC Installation of GAC POET Systems**: NYSDEC installed treatment systems at three off-base residences where drinking water well testing results were less than EPA's Health Advisory Level (70 ppt) but above New York's drinking water standard (Maximum Contaminant Level) of 10 ppt. NYSDOH installed a total of four treatment systems at the three locations.  The Air Force considered taking over the operation and maintenance of the four treatment systems. However, recent Department of Defense guidance limits Air Force actions to areas where EPA's Health Advisory Level is exceeded, not the State level.

**PFAS Remedial Investigation (RI)**: The Air Force is currently conducting a comprehensive study, called a Remedial Investigation, to examine the nature and extent of PFAS on the base. The Air Force conducted the first phase of field work for the investigation during 2021 and 2022, after the work plan was approved by EPA and NYSDEC. The Air Force sampled soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment, in addition to fish from the Salmon River and on-base streams. The Air Force submitted a draft report summarizing the results of the first phase of field work to EPA and NYSDEC for review in March 2023. EPA and NYSDEC submitted comments to the Air Force on the report in May 2023. The Air Force will use the comments to develop the report for the 2nd field event. The Air Force began field work for the 2nd phase of the Remedial Investigation in late July 2023. EPA and NYSDEC reviewed the Work Plan for the 2nd phase of the field work and submitted comments on it to the Air Force in May 2023. EPA provided preliminary approval of the revised Work Plan to the Air Force in late August 2023.

**Other Work:** Nearly all of the hazardous waste sites at the base have already been cleaned up. Cleanup actions are still in full or partial operation at only five sites at the base. This includes the four base landfills, which were capped in the late 1990’s. Groundwater and surface water monitoring at and near the landfills is still conducted periodically, and the caps are inspected annually for their integrity.

The Fire Training Area / Industrial Area groundwater treatment systems are still partially in operation. These consist of a groundwater collection trench between the runway and flightline (the parking and servicing area for airplanes); five groundwater extraction wells located down gradient of the Fire Training Area (operation suspended); a groundwater treatment system to treat contaminated groundwater from the extraction wells and the runway / flightline collection trench (operation of the treatment system currently suspended); a groundwater collection trench located just east of the flightline whose discharge is treated by an aeration system; a groundwater collection trench located along Idaho Avenue; monitoring of groundwater discharged from all of the collection trenches; Soil Vapor Extraction (SVE) systems installed in Building 2753, Building 2766, and New Building C to address Soil Vapor Intrusion (SVI) underneath the buildings (operation of the systems at Buildings 2766 and New Building C currently suspended); other groundwater and surface water monitoring; and Institutional Controls to prohibit the use of groundwater, restrict the discharge of groundwater, prohibit development that would interfere with cleanup operations or penetrate the subsurface clay confining layer, limit current use and future property development to non-residential uses, and use restrictions related to soil vapor intrusion, including an occupancy restriction for Building 2612.

Additional investigation and cleanup activities are currently being conducted by the Air Force as part of its Optimization Program. Under this program, the Air Force has been re-evaluating previous cleanup decisions to make the cleanups more efficient. This includes potential improvements and changes to existing cleanup plans; reducing sampling and monitoring, subject to EPA and NYSDEC approval; and potentially removing Land Use Controls / Institutional Controls (LUC/ICs) by resampling previously contaminated areas and conducting more stringent human health risk assessments, or by implementing an active cleanup. Improvements and changes to existing cleanup remedies are being conducted as pilot studies. A pilot study is a preliminary test or study of the program or evaluation activities to try out procedures and make any needed changes or adjustments. EPA and NYSDEC will consider approving the improvements, changes, and LUC/IC removal proposals made by the Air Force after reviewing all of the associated documents.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Numerous Land Use Controls / Institutional Controls (LUC/ICs) cover much of the former base and are discussed in other sections of this site profile.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Sampling and monitoring are ongoing at the former base and are discussed in other sections of this site profile.

### Emergency Response and Removal

**PFAS (PFOS and PFOA) Recent and Future Planned Response Actions at the former Plattsburgh AFB**

Response actions for the emerging contaminants known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are currently ongoing at the former base.

**Municipal Water Line Extension:** The Air Force plans to extend a portion of the Plattsburgh municipal water line to three off-base residences that currently use private drinking water wells.

The Air Force conducted an Engineering Evaluation / Cost Analysis to evalute potential response actions to address the situation long-term. EPA and NYSDEC reviewed and commented on the draft Engineering Evaluation / Cost Analysis Report, and eventually approved the final Report. The Air Force held a public comment period on the Report in September 2022, and no comments were received from the public. The Air Force's legal Department is currently reviewing the draft Action Memo to extend the municipal water line. Once the draft Action Memo is completed it will be submitted to EPA and NYSDEC for review and comment.

The Air Force also installed a POET system at a fourth off-base residence with combined PFOS/PFOA above 70 ppt in its drinking water well. Because this residence is not located near any existing municipal water lines, the Air Force plans to continue to test, operate and maintain this system.

**NYSDEC Installation of GAC POET Systems**: NYSDEC installed treatment systems at three off-base residences where drinking water well testing results were less than EPA's Health Advisory Level (70 ppt) but above New York's drinking water standard (Maximum Contaminant Level) of 10 ppt. NYSDEC installed a total of four treatment systems at the three locations.  The Air Force considered taking over the operation and maintenance of the four treatment systems. However, recent Department of Defense guidance limits Air Force actions to areas where EPA's Health Advisory Level is exceeded, not the State level.

### Enforcement Information

EPA placed Plattsburgh Air Force Base on the Superfund Program’s National Priorities List in November 1989. A Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) governing the identification, investigation, and cleanup of hazardous wastes at the base was signed by the Air Force, EPA, and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) in 1991. Under this agreement, the Air Force conducts hazardous waste investigations and cleanups under its Installation Restoration Program (IRP) as the potentially responsible party (PRP) and lead agency, with oversight of these activities conducted by EPA, NYSDEC, and more recently the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH).
