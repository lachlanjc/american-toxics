Background
Located in Kent, New York, the Arsenic Mine site includes a historic mine known as Pine Pond Mine, Silver Mine, and Brown’s Serpentine Mine. There are two former entry shafts and a northern mine shaft on private property. A southern mine shaft lies in the adjacent Nimham Mountain Multi-Use Area, a state recreational area that is not part of the site. The site includes undeveloped and residential properties around and downslope from the northern mine shaft, near the intersection of Gipsy Trail Road and Mount Nimham Court. Exposure to arsenic in a drinking water well that had been installed through mine tailings (ground rock generated from mining operations) resulted in the hospitalization of residents who lived in a house located next to the northern mine entrance. EPA installed a cistern at that residence as an alternative drinking water supply.  Limited soil sampling on the properties near the northern mine entrance in the late 1980s and early 1990s revealed significant concentrations of arsenic in soil.  EPA took samples of soil and drinking water s in 2017 and 2018 from undeveloped and residential properties around and downslope from the northern mine shaft. Because these samples showed elevated levels of arsenic, EPA took action to reduce the likelihood of residents coming into direct contact with the soil. This included covering certain areas and providing ways to prevent soil from being tracked into the homes. EPA has been assessing people’s well water on a quarterly basis.  
The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) released a Health Consultation in 2019, in which it evaluated shallow residential soil at the site. NYSDOH concluded that children’s short-term exposure to surface soil with the highest concentrations of arsenic poses an immediate and significant threat to human health, which is an urgent public health hazard. It also concluded that long-term exposure of children and adults to arsenic in surface soil poses a significant threat to human health, also a public health hazard.  EPA supported these conclusions in a Determination of Significant Threat memorandum. Because EPA found that all residential properties at the site contain concentrations at or above an unacceptable risk, it asked the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to assess the site. ATSDR issued a Public Health Advisory in 2019 that recommended immediate short- and long-term measures to remove people, especially children, from exposure to arsenic in shallow soil at the site.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In 2019, EPA provided residents with indoor and outdoor doormats and boot brushes, dug up soil in dog pens and backfilled those pens with wood chips, created woodchip or stone walkways, and paved or added stone to driveways. In addition, EPA began quarterly drinking water assessments.  After EPA added the Arsenic Mine site to the Superfund National Priorities List in 2019, it conducted an investigation and finalized a cleanup plan in June 2020. The plan is considered an “early action,” as EPA continues its broader investigation of the entire area.  The plan includes offers to permanently relocate people by purchasing certain contaminated properties. Once the properties are vacated, the houses will be demolished. EPA’s plan also includes institutional controls, such as environmental easements, that will permanently limit the use of the land. EPA will periodically inspect each occupied residence to ensure these measures remain protective. These actions will end when residents from each affected residence are permanently relocated or until a final cleanup is completed. EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) entered into an interagency agreement in September 2020, under which EPA provided funds to USACE to oversee the relocation work. USACE is the federal government’s relocation expert. Offers to sell were made to six property owners. One property owner indicated that he was not interested in relocating.  Of the five homeowners that committed to relocation, five have been relocated.  The house of the fifth property owner has been sold and a new house has been purchased. It is anticipated that the final property will move into their new home in late July 2024. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
The demolition of three of the four vacated houses was performed in 10/2023. Three of the vacated houses were demolished in October 2023. It is anticipated that the two remaining houses will be demolished in late summer/ealy fall, 2024. A remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine the nature and extent of the contamination at the site and identify and evaluate cleanup alternatives to address it is in the planning stages.  Top of Page
Emergency Response and Removal
EPA found arsenic in a drinking water well after in 1987, residents living in a house adjacent to the northern mine entrance were hospitalized due to their exposure to arsenic. The drinking water well had been installed through tailings (ground rock generated from mining operations) from mining operations. EPA installed a cistern at that residence for drinking water deliveries as an alternative drinking water supply. The Putnam County Health Department (PCHD) in coordination with EPA and NYSDOH, sampled soil on the properties near the northern mine entrance in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The sampling revealed significant concentrations of arsenic in surface soil. PCHD placed a warning sign near the northern mine entrance indicating the presence of elevated arsenic levels in soil. The owner of the cistern requested EPA’s assistance in 2016 to repair the cistern. During the repairs, EPA found sediment in the bottom of the cistern with high levels of arsenic.  EPA collected soil samples in 2017 and 2018. EPA also sampled drinking water in 2018 at the seven residential properties located in areas of concern within the site. In 2019, EPA provided residents with indoor and outdoor door mats and boot brushes, dug up soil in dog pens and backfilled those pens with wood chips, created woodchip or stone walkways, and paved or added stone to driveways. In addition, EPA began quarterly drinking water assessments. 
These interim measures reduced the risk to public health as EPA evaluates long-term methods to clean up the site.

Enforcement Information
The arsenic mining companies that historically operated at the site are no longer in existence. The properties are owned by impacted residents who did not contribute any contamination to the site.
