Background
The 10-acre Dubose Oil Products Company site is located in Cantonment, Florida. The site includes the area where the Dubose Oil Products Company operated a waste storage, treatment, recycling and disposal facility from 1979 to 1981. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1986 because of contaminated soil, groundwater and surface water resulting from facility operations. EPA, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. Cleanup activites removed all Site related contamination. The site does not threaten people living and working near the site. By cleaning up the site, EPA, FDEP and the site’s PRPs continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2004. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The 10-acre site is located in a rural residential area in Escambia County near Cantonment, Florida, about 10 miles north of Pensacola. The site includes two ponds built to retain natural spring seepage and stormwater runoff. Agricultural land and undeveloped forested areas border the site to the north, residential areas border the site to the south and east, and tree farms border the site to the west. From 1979 until 1981, the Dubose Oil Products Company operated a waste storage, treatment, recycling and disposal facility at the site. Operations included recovering usable oil products from waste oil, petroleum refining wastes and oil-based waste solvents. The facility included a processing area and three ponds. In 1986, the EPA listed the site on the NPL. Following cleanup activities, the EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 2004. The site is not currently in use. 
Between 1984 and 1985, FDEP conducted short-term cleanup activities, digging up contaminated soils and placing them in an on-site impoundment area. The impoundment area included the South Pond, which FDEP dug up and lined with a synthetic liner. FDEP filled the impoundment area with about 38,000 cubic yards of soil, creating a soil mound about 20 feet high. FDEP covered the soil mound with a synthetic cover.
The site’s potentionally responsible party (PRPs) began cleanup activities in 1993, with oversight provided by EPA and FDEP. PRPs completed the installation of the wastewater treatment plant in 1993 and the treatment of on-site soils in 1994. From 1995 to 2000, the PRPs conducted quarterly groundwater and surface water monitoring. The PRPs completed additional surface water sampling in 2001 and groundwater and surface water sampling at selected locations in 2002 and 2003.
In 2003, EPA determined that the site had been cleaned up and no further cleanup activities were necessary. EPA took the site off the NPL in 2004.
EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review, completed in 2008, concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. EPA does not require additional Five-Year Reviews for the site because all cleanup goals were achieved and the site is designated as Unlimited Use/Unlimited Exposure (UU/UE).

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site’s long-term remedy, selected in 1990, included digging up contaminated soil, using living organisms to break down contaminants in soil, draining and backfilling on-site ponds with clean soil, removing on-site structures, grading and revegetating dug-up areas, installing surface water runoff controls, monitoring groundwater, and placing institutional controls on the site property to limit land use.EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 2004. EPA does not require additional Five-Year Reviews for the site.
