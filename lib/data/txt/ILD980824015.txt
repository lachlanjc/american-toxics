### Background

The Kerr-McGee (Residential Areas) site is one of four Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) sites in the West Chicago area contaminated with radioactive thorium wastes. The radioactive waste came from a nearby facility known as the Rare Earths Facility (REF). The REF, operated by Lindsay Light and Chemical Company and its successors from 1932 until 1973, produced non-radioactive elements known as rare earths and radioactive elements such as thorium, radium and uranium along with gas lantern mantles for private entities and federal atomic energy programs. Site cleanup is scheduled for completion in July 2014.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. In January 2009, Tronox (formerly Kerr-McGee) filed for bankruptcy. Because of the bankruptcy settlement, the West Chicago Environmental Response Trust was set up to complete cleanup and monitoring for the four West Chicago Kerr-McGee Superfund sites.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In January 2009, Tronox (formerly Kerr-McGee) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As a result of the bankruptcy settlement, the West Chicago Environmental Response Trust was set up to complete the cleanup and monitoring for the four West Chicago Kerr-McGee Superfund sites. As of April 2014, approximately 111,000 cubic yards of contaminated soils have been removed from more than 676 properties. Only one known property requiring cleanup remains and it is scheduled to be completed by July 2014. EPA routinely receives inquiries from general public in regards to the status of specific properties. In some cases EPA receives new information and determines additional sampling efforts are warranted. If any contamination is found above the cleanup standard, the property will be cleaned up by the Trust.
