### Background

The Shieldalloy Metallurgical Corp. (SMC) site is in Newfield, NJ. The site is comprised of the “SMC facility” and the “farm parcel”, as well as the Hudson Branch, an intermittent stream that discharges into Burnt Mill Pond. The SMC facility is approximately 67.5 acres and was the location of a specialty plant where chromium alloy and other products were produced. The farm parcel, a 19.8-acre detached farmland sits about 2,000 feet southwest of the facility. Although the farm parcel has never been used for manufacturing activities, it is considered a part of the site because SMC purchased the land to implement the cleanup. SMC released processed wastewater causing groundwater contamination. The soil is contaminated with heavy metals. Area residents have been connected to the public water supply. After initial actions to protect human health and the environment, site investigations and cleanup are ongoing.

The SMC facility has a restricted area with radiological contamination which is not part of the Superfund site and is being addressed by New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), as authorized by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The restricted area is surrounded by a chain link fence with barbed wire and is posted with signs. Inside the perimeter fence is a storage area with slag and dusts containing low levels of radioactive isotopes generated during past facility operations. Further information about the environmental response actions to address the restricted area is available from NJDEP.

Ores and minerals were processed to produce primary metals, specialty metals, and ferro alloys at the SMC Newfield facility between 1955 and 2006. Raw materials have contained the following metals: chromium, bismuth, copper, titanium, vanadium, calcium, aluminum, zirconium, iron, lead, nickel, silicon, magnesium, manganese, fluoride salts and oxides of niobium, vanadium, barium, calcium and aluminum.

NJDEP first observed chromium contamination in the groundwater in early 1970 at a Borough of Newfield municipal well and a private well. As a result, NJDEP directed SMC to perform groundwater investigations to determine the extent of the chromium contamination and to develop an appropriate remedial action. In 1979, SMC began pumping and treating chromium-contaminated groundwater. In addition, with NJDEP oversight, SMC closed nine lagoons that stored wastewaters between 1994 and 1997. SMC also removed sludge, liner, contaminated soil. SMC also samples the groundwater after removing the contaminated soil and added clean backfill.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1984 after initial removal actions and site investigations.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Initial Actions: SMC, the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP), pumped and treated chromium- and VOC -contaminated groundwater from 1979 to 2014. The initial pump-and-treat system was designed to pump and treat 80 gallons per minute (gpm) of contaminated groundwater. SMC built a new ion exchange treatment facility in 1989 to pump and treat 400 gpm of contaminated groundwater. However, technical problems with the ion exchanger prevented the facility from operating at design capacity. In 1992, SMC installed an electrochemical treatment unit that effectively treated the hexavalent chromium groundwater contamination. TRC Environmental Corporation (TRC) and SMC entered into a contract effective January 11, 2006 by which TRC agreed to assume certain cleanup liability otherwise held by SMC for all contaminants at the site, with the exception of the contaminant perchlorate and any of the radiological contamination.

Initially, with EPA assistance, NJDEP was directly overseeing the PRP-performed actions at the site. EPA became the lead agency for the site cleanup as stated in a September 2, 2008 letter to SMC. Subsequently, on April 28, 2010, EPA, SMC, and TRC signed an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC). The NRC-regulated slag pile is not included in the AOC.

TRC submitted a study that EPA approved in November 2010 which concluded that the pump and treat remedy selected in the 1996 ROD had successfully reduced contaminants concentrations for chromium and trichloroethene, but that groundwater concentrations had reached asymptotic conditions (steady state) for over 10 years. The study also indicated that additional actions were required to expedite the cleanup. TRC contructed a new treatment plant using ion exchange to improve operating efficiencies. TRC also advanced a pilot program to evaluate the effectiveness of *in-situ* (in place) remediation technologies to expedite groundwater cleanup in 2011. An *in-situ* pilot program conducted at the site included extensive studies, including small scale injections and large scale injections. Because *in-situ* technologies can foster conditions suitable for monitored natural attenuation (MNA), a detailed MNA study was also initiated in conjunction with the *in-situ* pilot treatability program. The pilot program has resulted in a dramatic reduction in the chromium and VOC concentrations in the groundwater plume.

Regulated Slag Pile: SMC submitted a decommissioning plan to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for review in June 2006. The plan outlined SMC’s proposal to decommission the slag pile by capping the radioactive material on-site. EPA completed its technical review of the plan in 2007 and provided its input to the NRC. According to a a 2014 federal ruling, NJDEP’s Bureau of Environmental Radiation, under license number 517488-RAD130001, is now regulating SMC. SMC submitted a new draft decommissioning plan, which NJDEP approved in January 2017. The decommissioning plan states that approximately 50,000 tons of slag and baghouse dust containing low levels of radioactivity will be removed from the site.

Under NJDEP oversight, SMC began shipping radioactive slag in late spring 2020. All the slag is expected to be shipped by the end of 2023.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in four stages: initial actions and three long-term remedial phases focused on the groundwater contaminant plume cleanup, and soil and sediment contamination at the SMC facility. NJDEP is also working with SMC to address the low-level radioactive waste material.

The initial contaminated groundwater treatment reduced the threat to human health and the environment by mitigating the movement of contaminated groundwater. In the meantime, studies leading to the final selection of cleanup technologies for the site are taking place.

Groundwater Plume: SMC, the site’s Potentially Responsible Party (PRP), completed a study of the chromium contaminant plume. During this study, in addition to chromium, sampling detected volatile organic compound (VOC) contamination in groundwater underneath and downgradient of the facility. NJDEP, in consultation with EPA, selected the remedy for the site’s groundwater contaminant plume in a September 1996 Record of Decision (ROD). It called for modifying the existing groundwater remediation system to provide for the complete capture and treatment of groundwater contamination, installing an air stripper to remove VOCs, and incorporating the electrochemical unit into the remedy to remove metals. Further delineation was conducted to fully define the extent of chromium and VOC contamination.

EPA is addressing the site using three separate components called operable units (OUs).

OU1 work included a supplemental remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to address the delineation and cleanup of all contaminants, except perchlorate, found in groundwater. It includes all activity necessary to complete the supplemental investigation study and, if necessary, a remedial design of the existing selected remedy set forth in the 1996 ROD. The supplemental RI for OU1 was conducted between October 19, 2010 and December 7, 2010. The primary purpose of the OU1 supplemental RI was to identify the downgradient extent of chromium and volatile organic compounds, primarily trichloroethene, in groundwater. EPA approved the OU1 supplemental investigation report in February 2014. A ROD Amendment was issued on September 30, 2015 changing the existing pump-and-treat remedy to *i* *n-situ* remediation, monitored natural attenuation, institutional controls, long-term monitoring, and five-year reviews.

OU2 work included a supplemental RI/FS to include a full characterization of the nature and extent of all contaminants, except perchlorate, found in the soil, surface water and sediment at the site. It also included developing and evaluating potential remedial alternatives. The supplemental OU2 RI/FS was conducted in January 2012. The RI/FS results are documented in the April 2013 RI report and the May 2014 FS report. An OU2 ROD was issued on September 25, 2014. The OU2 ROD selected capping soil found at the SMC facility, excavating sediments from the Hudson Branch, and institutional controls. An Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for the OU2 Remedial Design was signed on March 10, 2015. EPA is reviewing the final OU2 remedy design. A legal agreement was signed with Shieldalloy Metallurgical Corporation on November 16, 2016 to perform a cleanup of the contaminated soil, sediment, surface water, and a modified cleanup measure for the groundwater. The cleanup began in June 2018 and was completed in March 2020.

The OU2 cleanup was conducted in four phases:

During the first phase, sediment from the Hudson Branch near the SMC facility was excavated and contaminated soil in the Eastern Storage Areas on the SMC Facility were capped between September 2018 and March 2019.

During the second phase, Hudson Branch sediment near the Car Wash was excavated between April 2019 and May 2019.

The third phase, which occurred between May 2019 and September 2019, sediment from the Hudson Branch near the Farm Parcel was excavated..

During the fourth and final phase, sediment from the Hudson Branch at the intersection of Arbor and Northwest Avenue was excavated between September 2019 and January 2020.

EPA conditionally approved the OU2 Final Design Report in June 2017. Subsequently, SMC's radiological screening survey of Phase one and two areas of the Hudson Branch sediment indicated that some areas contained radioactivity that slightly exceeded the NJDEP’s most restrictive standards for soil. These areas are located within and slightly beyond the areas of metals contaminated sediment that must be removed as part of the OU2 remedial activities. Based on these findings, the OU2 Remedial Design Report was amended to include additional excavation and waste screening, as well as handling requirements for the sediment. Phase three and four areas were similarly surveyed. EPA worked closely with NJDEP under SMC’s Radioactive Materials License to coordinate the OU2 cleanup work activities because of the presence of radioactivity mixed with the contamination in the sediments. As part of site decommissioning activities, SMC installed a rail spur at the site during the summer of 2019.

The contaminated Hudson Branch materials were excavated and temporarily placed in a lined staging area located within a “restricted area” at the SMC Facility. Trucks transported the excavated material from the different areas of OU2 into the staging area and then the excavated materials were transported by rail cars to an appropriate licensed off-site disposal facility in Michigan.

he first rail cars transporting OU2 waste were sent on October 14, 2019.

OU3 includes an RI/FS that addresses a full characterization of the nature and extent of the perchlorate contamination found in any media at the site and developing and evaluating potential remedial alternatives. The initial phase of the OU3 remedial investigation to delineate the perchlorate contamination in soil, sediments, surface water and groundwater was conducted between October and December 2009. A second round of groundwater sampling was completed in September 2010 and one additional monitoring well was installed in April 2011. EPA approved the OU3 human health risk assessment.

SMC, with EPA oversight, is currently performing a supplemental RI to provide current data that will be used to select a remedy, including the Development and Screening of Response Alternative and the Feasibility Study.

Field work for a supplemental remedial investigation was completed in March 2021. A supplemental remedial Investigation report is expected in Fall 2021.
