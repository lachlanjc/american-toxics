### Background

The Acme Steel Coke Plant site was a formerly active coking facility located 14 miles south of downtown Chicago, in Cook County Illinois. The Plant, once known as “Chicago Coke Plant” was one of three facilities in the Chicago area owned and operated by Interlake, Inc. Coke was produced through destructive distillation (coking) of coal in large airtight ovens, creating a product then used in iron and steel production. The Acme facility consists of approximately 104 acres and has been inactive since operations shut down in November of 2001.

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Acme Steel Coke Plant was one of several industrial facilities in the area surrounding the Calumet River. The coke plant located on Chicago’s south side was incorporated as the By-Product Corporation in June 1905. In 1911, the By-Product Corporation operated 8 blocks of coke ovens. In December of 1929, the name of the company was changed from By-Product Corporation to Interlake Iron Corporation. In 1964, Acme Steel Company and the Interlake Iron Company merged, combining Interlake’s mining, iron, and coke production facilities with Acme’s steel producing and finished product capabilities. In 1986, Interlake Steel Corporation reorganized, and a newly formed Acme Steel Company took over the coke and steel making facilities in the area. Acme Steel struggled to remain profitable and by the end of the 1990s, the number of employees dropped to around 1,200, down from approximately 3,500 in the mid-1970s. In October 2001, the coke plant began to shut down its operations.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

#### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) on March 7, 2024, making it a Superfund site. Stay tuned for upcoming public engagement opportunities during the summer of 2024.

#### Was any cleanup work previously done at the site?

In 2002 and 2004, U.S. EPA conducted a site assessment and inspections at the Acme Steel Company facilities to determine the threats to human health and the environment. In 2005, based on these inspections and sampling data from the state of Illinois, U.S. EPA and its contractors mobilized to install site security measures and prevent trespassing. During 2006 and 2007, U.S EPA conducted response actions to contain and remove immediate site hazards, including an old transformer, miscellaneous drums and totes, asbestos containing piping material, and soil contaminated with cyanide and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

#### What are the boundaries of the contamination?

As of March 2024, U.S. EPA has not fully investigated the contamination at the site. By listing the Acme site on the NPL, the site will go through an investigative process to determine the extent, levels, and specific locations of contamination. Based on previous sampling and information from U.S. EPA and Illinois EPA, SVOC contamination extends into the Calumet River and Indian Ridge Marsh. Also, groundwater samples collected on-site showed elevated levels of benzene.
