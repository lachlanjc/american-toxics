Background
The General Mills/Henkel Corporation site is located on East Hennepin Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota. General Mills used the area as a food research facility beginning in 1930 and for chemical research from 1947 to 1977. Waste disposal operations from 1947 to 1962 contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. The property was purchased by the Henkel Corporation in 1977 and was sold to BBD Holding in 1989. Soil and groundwater cleanup has occurred at the Site, and additional work to address the vapor intrusion pathway is nearing completion. Groundwater monitoring continues at the Site. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed by General Mills, Inc. with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) oversight. The Site is part of US EPA's Enforcement Deferral Pilot Agreement with MPCA, where US EPA does not sign Site decision documents and MPCA leads the management of the Site. Contaminated soil near a waste disposal pit on the Site was removed in the 1980’s.  In 1984, MPCA and General Mills, Inc., signed an agreement to clean up groundwater contamination at the Site. From 1985 to 2010, General Mills operated a groundwater pump and treat system to remove contamination from groundwater. Beginning in 2013, General Mills installed mitigation systems for several hundred homes that were at risk from air (vapor) contamination. MPCA has conducted several five-year reviews of the General Mills site’s remedy. These reviews evaluate the effectiveness of the remedies put in place to protect public health and the environment, and whether they function as intended by Site decision documents. The most recent review, finalized by MPCA in 2021, concluded that: 
Groundwater: The groundwater remedy is not protective of human health due to the identified vapor intrusion risk to building receptors at the Site associated with the shallow groundwater contamination. Groundwater contaminant concentrations have also increased since the temporary shutdown of the groundwater pump and treat system in 2010.
Soil: The “no further action” remedy for the soils is protective of human health and the environment.
Air – Vapor Intrusion: The vapor intrusion exposure pathway has been evaluated. Most of the buildings requiring protection now have vapor mitigation systems; however, there are still buildings that require mitigation.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site’s long-term remedy included groundwater pumping to prevent further migration of contaminants and to improve groundwater quality. The groundwater pump and treat system began operating in 1985 and shut down in 2010. It successfully removed several contaminants, but trichloroethylene remains in the groundwater.   After more investigation, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) found additional sources of groundwater and vapor contamination in an area northeast of the site. MPCA is investigating the additional sources, known together as the Southeast Hennepin Groundwater and Vapor site. Vapor mitigation systems will need to continue operating and being maintained in affected homes until all sources are cleaned up. More information and regular site updates are available at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) website..

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Activity and use limitations are in place at the Site and are called institutional controls by the US EPA. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup. For more background, see Institutional Controls. Summaries of institutional controls in place at the General Mills/Henkel Corporation site are provided below. Soils (greater than 4 feet below ground surface): 
Soil Impacted Area shall be used for industrial/commercial purposes only.
No disturbance or alteration that would expose or disturb the subsurface soils (greater than 4 feet below ground surface). 
Groundwater: 
No disturbance or dewatering of groundwater is to take place beneath the Groundwater Impacted Area without prior authorization from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA).
Requires notification to the Commissioner of proposed construction of a groundwater supply well.
Requires Minnesota Department of Health Commissioner approval for construction and modification of wells and borings within the Special Well and Boring Construction Areas (SWCAs).

Enforcement Information
The site is part of EPA’s Enforcement Deferral Pilot Agreement with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). Therefore, MPCA is the primary agency overseeing cleanup at the site. More information and regular site updates are available at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency website.
