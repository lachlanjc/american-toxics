Background
The Fulbright Landfill Site is located in Springfield, Missouri. The city of Springfield owned and operated the 98-acre landfill from 1962 to 1968, accepting wastes that contaminated the soil and groundwater with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other organic chemicals, heavy metals and cyanide. The site also included the nearby 114-acre Sac River Landfill, which accepted similar wastes from 1968 to 1974.  In 1978, a geology student discovered high concentrations of copper, chromium and manganese in surface soils near the stream bank of the Fulbright Landfill. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency became aware of the Fulbright Landfill in June 1980 from communications with a Springfield television reporter.   In October 1981, the Fulbright Landfill was listed on the Interim National Priorities List (NPL) because limited field sampling and subsequent testing indicated the presence of hazardous substances in surface water and groundwater close to the landfill. The site was proposed for addition to the NPL on December 30, 1982, and placed on the final NPL on September 8, 1983. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversight, the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) for the site completed investigations into the nature and extent of contamination in 1988. The site’s long-term remedy included removal of drums and drum remnants from the sinkhole and trench, sampling of drum contents, disposal of removed drum contents off-site, groundwater and surface water monitoring, monitoring of leachate and deed restrictions to prevent future development and use of groundwater. The EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. The purpose of these reviews is to ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review conducted in 2020 concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy is protective of human health and the environment in the short term. The remedy continues to prevent direct contact with contaminated landfill materials and soils and minimizes surface water runoff and infiltration. Soil and soil gas concentrations are below levels that will impact recreational and industrial uses of the landfill properties. In addition, all off-site groundwater wells sampled during this review had contaminants of concern (COC) detections below concentrations of concern. In order to be protective in the long-term, additional groundwater monitoring is needed to evaluate the extent of volatile organic compounds (VOC) contamination at the southern end of the Fulbright landfill. Further, an additional ecological risk assessment is needed to evaulate potential site impacts to insectivorous birds.  Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
In May 2020, the Fulbright Spring Greenway (a walking/biking recreational trail) was opened across the surface of the Fulbright landfill. The addition of more fill material and regrading continues at the Sac River landfill in anticipation of an extention of recreational trails across its surface in the future. This change in use for both landfills required revisions to the deed restrictions originally put on the site and the implementation of an environmental covenant to restrict certain types of reuse activities. Additional soil sampling has been conducted at the Fulbright landfill to ensure that there is no exposure pathway between users of the proposed trail and surface soils. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
In 2016, three separate environmental covernants were put in place to restrict certain activities and uses at the Fulbright landfill, the Sac River landfill and the Chemical Disposal Pit located at the Fulbright Landfill. The covenants for the Fulbright landfill and the Sac River landfill restrict use of the groundwater underneath the property, the installation of new groundwater wells at the property and any excavation or construction on the property without prior approval of the EPA. The convenants also require the maintenance of the soil caps. The environmental covenant for the Chemical Disposal Pit requires the same restrictions as the Fulbright landfill and Sac River landfill covenants; however, it also requires the area to be fenced in with appropriate signage.

Sampling and Monitoring
Annual groundwater monitoring is conducted at the site by the city of Springfield. During the annual groundwater monitoring efforts, samples are collected from two nested pairs of alluvial (shallow) and limestone (deep) wells in the Springfield Plateau aquifer at each landfill and the potable water well in the Ozark aquifer at the Northwest Wastewater Treatment Plant. The Fulbright Landfill monitoring wells are FDG1S and FDG1D located southwest of the former cyanide pit area. The Sac River Landfill wells are SRDG1S and SRDG1D located southwest of the former quarry disposal area. The emergency public water supply well upgradient of the site is also sampled annually to provide additional data. Once every five years, samples are also taken from two additional wells at the Fulbright Landfill (FDG5S and FDG5D). In support of the potential recreational reuse of the property, the city of Springfield also periodically samples seeps along the rivers and surface soils upon request by the EPA. Top of Page
Enforcement Information
In March 1986, the EPA issued a Consent Order to the city of Springfield, Litton Industries, Inc. and Litton Business Systems, Inc., organizations identified as potentially responsible parties. The Order required them to conduct an extensive site investigation under EPA oversight. In 1990, the EPA and these parties entered into a Consent Decree for the PRPs to design and implement the selected remedies. Top of Page
