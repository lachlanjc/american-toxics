### Background

The Brine Service Company site is located in Corpus Christi, Texas. The site includes waste disposal pits formerly owned and operated by Brine Service Company. Disposal of oil field wastes, including drilling fluids and refinery wastes, took place at the pits from 1946 to the 1960s. Excavation work in 1997 and subsequent sampling in 2000 identified contamination in the pits. The site’s remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) is ongoing.

**Current Status**

The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, Region 6) and the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) signed an Administrative Order on Consent for a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS), on October 21, 2009, and an amendment on November 17, 2009. This enforcement document is an agreement between the EPA and the PRPs for the performance and financing of the RI/FS by the PRPs. The purpose of the RI/FS is to determine the nature and extent of contamination and to gather sufficient information about the Site to support an informed risk management decision regarding which remedy is the most appropriate for the Site. The RI/FS is currently being implemented by the PRPs with the EPA’s oversight. The EPA has approved the final RI, approved the Baseline Human Health Risk Assessment, and approved the Screening Level Ecological Risk Assessment Reports submitted by the PRPs in spring and summer of 2108 The PRPs completed an evaluation of cleanup alternatives for the SIte in the FS. EPA approved the FS in November 2018. The EPA is currently evaluating the cleanup alternatives outlined in the FS. The EPA preferred alternative will be outlined in the Proposed Plan.

The Brine Service Company Superfund Site (hereinafter “the Site”) is located approximately 6.5 miles west from downtown Corpus Christi, Texas, along the north side of IH-37, east-northeast of the intersection at Goldston Road, and south of Up River Road (see the “Site Map” section of this summary) near Tule Lake and the Corpus Christi Ship Channel. Corpus Christi is situated along the southern Gulf Coast of Texas. The Site is comprised of former waste disposal pits (i.e., north and south pits) or areas located on property formerly owned and operated by Brine Service Company. A portion of the pit area reportedly received oil field wastes, such as drilling fluids, and/or refinery wastes from as early as 1946 through the 1960’s. There were two pits on the Site; a North Pit and a South Pit. The South Pit received oil field wastes. There is no evidence that the North Pit received waste based on sampling conducted at the Site.

The site was discovered in 1997 when a pipeline company was advancing an excavation trench through a portion of the former Brine Service Company property to install interconnecting pipelines between two nearby refineries.

Commercial and industrial land uses surround the site. Several petroleum refineries are located nearby.

  
**Benefits**

The investigation and cleanup of the Site will ensure the protection of human health and the environment. Specific cleanup benefits will be identified in the EPA decision document.

**National Priorities List History**

The National Priorities List (NPL) is a list of national priorities among the known or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United States. The NPL is intended primarily to guide the EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation to assess the nature and extent of public health and environmental risks associated with a release of hazardous substances.

Final Listing Date: September 5, 2002

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

A response action was completed in January 2018. A sediment cap was installed in the ditch that runs from south to the north. The cap was installed to prevent contamination in the South Pit from entering the ditch and flowing off-site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA and the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) have completed the RI/FS. EPA is evaluating the cleanup alternatives evaluated in the FS and will propose a cleanup plan and select a long-term remedy.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
