### Background

The Neals Landfill site occupies nearly 18 acres of property, approximately three miles west of Bloomington, Indiana. The landfill is surrounded by farm and wooded lands. Several residents are located within one- half mile of the landfill. Residents near the site use private wells for drinking water. The landfill accepted industrial and municipal wastes from 1949 until 1972. Between approximately 1962 until 1970, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, formerly Viacom and now doing business as CBS Corporation, dumped waste electrical equipment and parts, including electrical capacitors containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), PCB-contaminated capacitor insulation material, rags, and filter clay at the site. Several springs located at the foot of the landfill feed the Conards Branch stream which had become contaminated with PCBs. Conards Branch is tributary to Richland Creek. Sediments and fish in Conrads Branch and Richland Creek have also become contaminated with PCBs.

In August 1985, Westinghouse, The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the City of Bloomington, Monroe County, and the Indiana State Board of Health signed a Consent Decree (CD) to address PCB-contaminated materials from six sites, located in and near Bloomington, including Neals Landfill. The CD required Westinghouse to construct an incinerator that would incinerate PCB-contaminated materials from the six sites. Also, in the CD and prior to the excavation of the Neals Landfill site, interim cleanup measures were required to be completed by Westinghouse. Due to public opposition to the incinerator and the State of Indiana passing legislation blocking the remedy that was required in the 1985 CD, the CD parties began to explore alternative remedies in 1994 for the six PCB contaminated sites.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Neal’s Landfill began operation in 1950. Neal’s Landfill is located approximately five miles due west of the City of Bloomington, Monroe County, Indiana. State Route 48 is located approximately 800 feet directly south of the site. The landfill initially consisted of approximately 18 acres and received mainly municipal waste, but industrial waste was also disposed of at the landfill until it was closed in 1972. The landfill was originally known as Whitehall Pike Landfill and was later renamed Neal’s Landfill after a former owner and operator. Between 1958 and 1965, the landfill was expanded into topographic low areas adjacent to a central east-west oriented ridge. CBS Corporation (formerly known as Westinghouse Electric Corporation and Viacom Inc.) owned and operated an industrial capacitor production facility in the City of Bloomington, Indiana. The insulating fluid used in the manufacture of the capacitors contained a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) dielectric fluid. During 1966 and 1967, scrap and off-specification electrical capacitors from the Westinghouse plant in Bloomington were disposed of at the landfill along with PCB-contaminated capacitor parts, filter aids, and sawdust resulting in the release of PCB-contaminated dielectric fluids.

The site is located in karst terrain and the drainage in the Neal’s Landfill area is characterized by rapid groundwater flow from sinkholes, through a branchwork of subterranean solution conduits and caves to discharge points at springs. Contaminants in karst groundwater may move rapidly through the drainage network to springs located miles from the source area without the benefit of normal attenuation processes. A majority of the drainage from Neal’s Landfill is released at the Northwest Spring System, which includes North Spring, South Spring and five storm water overflow springs. Groundwater quality data suggests that all the springs comprising the Northwest Spring System are fed by a single solutional conduit flow system. During storm events, PCBs are flushed through the karst conduits and released at the Northwest Spring System. The Northwest Spring System is the headwaters of Conard’s Branch which flows into Richland Creek.

Investigations for contamination at Neal’s Landfill began as early as 1976. Neal’s Landfill was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in October 1981. Extensive sampling and initial site cleanup activities began in 1983. The 1983 initial site interim remedial measures were implemented pursuant to a Stipulation and Order. In the first phase of interim remedial measures, a security fence was installed around the entire perimeter of the site. Visible capacitors (122) and associated stained soils were removed and disposed of off-site. A low-permeability clay cap was placed over the primary fill areas. Drainage control features and erosion control measures were also installed. Sediment sampling was also conducted in Conard’s Branch, Southwest Seep Branch, and Richland Creek. These activities were completed in May of 1984.

On December 4, 1984, an Enforcement Decision Document (EDD) was signed for six sites, including Neal’s Landfill (Neal’s Landfill, Neal’s Dump, Bennett’s Dump, Lemon Lane Landfill, Anderson Road Landfill and Winston Thomas Sewage Treatment Plant). A settlement was reached through a Consent Decree (CD), which was entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on August 22, 1985. Four of the six sites (Neal’s Landfill, Lemon Lane Landfill, Neal’s Dump, Bennett’s Dump) are NPL sites. The parties to the Consent Decree include the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), State of Indiana, City of Bloomington, Monroe County, and CBS Corporation. The EDD and Consent Decree called for the construction of a permitted, Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) approved, dedicated, municipal solid waste-fired incinerator to be used to destroy PCB-contaminated soils and materials excavated from the six sites.

Under the terms of the EDD and 1985 CD, the second phase of the interim remedial measures was completed. Sediments were removed from a 4,500-linear-foot length of Conard’s Branch and 300 linear feet of Richland Creek. The sediment cleanup was completed in October 1988 and approximately 5,000 tons of stream bed sediments and stream bank material were excavated and temporarily stored at an interim storage facility until they were disposed of at an approved landfill in 1998. CBS also was required to construct a water treatment plant to collect water up to 1 cubic foot per second (cfs) from South Spring, North Spring and the Southwest Seep. Based upon data acquired from the treatment plant, the facility was designed for 450 gallons per minute (gpm) capacity, but often treats as much as 500 gpm. In the Consent Decree, the discharge criterion for the water treatment plant was set to 1 part per billion (ppb) PCBs. The treatment plant became operational in February 1990.

Public opposition to the incinerator arose before and after entry of the 1985 CD. CBS submitted applications for the necessary permits to design and build the incinerator in 1991. The Indiana State Legislature, however, passed several laws which prevented any immediate consideration of CBS’s permit application. Due to the inability to implement the incineration remedy, in February 1994, the parties settled upon a set of principles to guide the process of exploring alternative remedies. These principles, known as the Operating Principles, provided, among other things, that the selection of remedial alternatives would be conducted in accordance with the EPA Record of Decision (ROD) Amendment process.

Due to little progress being made by the parties in determining alternative remedies, in November 1997, Federal Judge S. Hugh Dillin issued an Order requiring that the six Consent Decree sites be remediated by December 1999. Judge Dillin also assigned Special Master Kennard Foster to oversee the progress of the parties toward meeting the December 1999 deadline. At the time of the November 1997 Order, remediation at the Anderson Road Landfill was completed and remediation of a small portion of the Winston Thomas site was underway. After discussions between the parties, on February 1, 1999, Judge Dillin issued another Order approving and adopting the Report and Recommendations of Special Master Kennard Foster which (1) extended the deadline for completion of the source control at the remaining five sites until December 31, 2000, and (2) ordered the parties to engage in settlement discussions with respect to other issues, including remedial measures to address groundwater and surface water contamination.

Both EPA and CBS undertook a new, detailed investigation of the Neal’s Landfill site. EPA broke the site up into three operable units (OU) and they include a source control OU1, groundwater OU2 and sediment OU3. Based upon this re-investigation, EPA issued a Proposed Plan for the source control operable unit of the alternative remedy on December 21, 1998, and held a 45-day public comment period. The other governmental parties, including IDEM, City of Bloomington, and Monroe County concurred on the ROD Amendment. The ROD Amendment was signed on March 29, 1999. The source control operable unit remediation began on April 22, 1999.

The Remedial Action Objectives (RAOs) for the source control operable unit were to reduce or eliminate the direct contact threat associated with contaminated soil/landfill material, minimize contaminant migration within the karst topography and minimize future migration of groundwater contamination to surface water.

The source control operable unit remedy involved the following:

- Excavation and disposal of 41,747 tons of PCB-contaminated material greater than or equal to 500 parts per million (ppm) to Environmental Quality Company’s Wayne Disposal Landfill, in Belleville, Michigan, a TSCA-approved commercial chemical waste landfill.
- Excavation and transport of a total of 4,119 capacitors contaminated with PCBs to Onyx Environmental in Port Arthur, Texas, for incineration.
- Shrinking the size of the landfill from 18-acres to 10-acres through the consolidation of landfill material.
- Collection, shredding, and disposal of 28,881 tires under the final Neal’s Landfill cap.
- Installation of a Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C-compliant cap over the remaining landfill material. The cap consists of six inches of topsoil, 18-inches of clean granular fill, a geocomposite drainage layer, a 40- millimeter thick geomembrane, and a geosynthetic clay layer.
- Construction of perimeter drainage and a stormwater retention pond.
- Installation of 5 piezometers into the bottom of the landfill waste to monitor accumulation of any groundwater.
- Clean up of areas outside the landfill boundary.
- Implementation of Long-term Groundwater Monitoring and RCRA Cap Inspection and Maintenance Plans.
- Development and implementation of institutional controls if site does not meet unlimited use and unrestricted exposure (UU/UE).

Construction was completed for the Neal’s Landfill source control on November 3, 1999 and the Remedial Action Report was approved on November 8, 2000. The Neal’s Landfill RCRA Cap Inspection and Maintenance Plan was approved in April 2001. The following activities are performed by CBS pursuant to the approved plan:

- Routine quarterly inspections of the landfill cap for damage.
- Mowing.
- Annual application of herbicide at the fence lines and rip-rap drainage ways.
- Biennial topographic survey and subsidence report.

Under the direction of Special Master Kennard Foster, EPA, CBS Corporation, IDEM, Monroe County and the City of Bloomington continued to investigate and discuss the water and sediment operable units for three remaining sites, including Neal’s Landfill. On September 25, 2007, EPA signed the Neal’s Landfill Record of Decision for the groundwater and sediment operable units.

The Neal’s Landfill RAOs for the groundwater and sediment operable units are the following:

- Reduce the amount of PCBs released from groundwater to Conard’s Branch and Richland Creek through mass reduction.
- Improve PCB levels in fish for beneficial reuse by reducing PCBs released to Conard’s Branch and Richland Creek.
- Reduce the amount of PCB mass in sediments that may be available to fish by reducing PCBs released.

The major components of the Neal’s Landfill groundwater and sediment operable units consist of the following:

- Improvement of the spring water collection system to capture PCB-contaminated groundwater seeps which currently bypass the current collection system.
- Install a new effluent line farther downstream in Conard’s Branch for discharging water treated by the water treatment plant. This will prevent treated water from being collected by the new spring water collection system.
- Continue to operate the 450 gallons per minute (gpm) water treatment plant, which is capable of treating up to 500 gpm. The water treatment plant will meet a revised PCB effluent standard of 0.3 parts per billion (ppb). A revised Operation and Maintenance Plan will also be implemented for the water treatment plant.
- Implement a soil and sediment cleanup for in-stream sediments, bank soils and floodplain soils in Conard’s Branch. The cleanup criteria is 1 parts per million (ppm) on average for PCBs located in-stream sediments and bank soils and 5 ppm on average for floodplain soils. The estimated volume of contaminated soils and sediment is 1,141 cubic yards and this material will be disposed of off-site in a permitted landfill. The improvements to the spring water collection system for the 450 gallons per minute treatment plant and the sediment and soils cleanup are expected to reduce the PCB levels in fish tissue to acceptable levels within 10 years, based upon a fate and transport model.
- Implement institutional controls to prevent residential and commercial development for the 10-acre landfill cap, prevent residential development in the southeast portion of the site, prevent residential development and certain farming activities within the floodplain area of Conard’s Branch and prevent groundwater use on the site.

In February 2008, EPA, CBS Corporation, IDEM, Monroe County and the City of Bloomington reached an agreement on a Consent Decree Amendment for CBS to implement the remedies for Neal’s Landfill and two other sites. The Consent Decree Amendment was entered by the United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana on July 24, 2009.

Prior to the remediation of Conard’s Branch, CBS undertook a sampling program in Conard’s Branch from March 7, 2011 through July 13, 2011. The remediation of Conard’s Branch began July 21, 2011. The soil and sediment cleanup for in-stream sediments, bank soils and floodplain soils in Conards Branch was completed on September 6, 2011. Approximately 84 tons of PCB contaminated soils and sediments greater than 50 ppm were disposed off-site in a permitted landfill. A total of 838 tons of PCB contaminated soils and sediments less than 50 ppm were also disposed off-site in a permitted landfill. Concurrently with the Conard’s Branch remediation, the new effluent line and improved spring water collection system was installed and the pre-final inspection was completed on November 30, 2011 for all the remedy components.

The implementation of restrictive covenants is complete. The restrictive covenants include preventing development that could damage the landfill cap and drainage ditches, and only allow industrial development on areas surrounding the landfill boundary. The Sycamore Lane Trust owns the landfill and surrounding property and CBS Corporation owns the property on which the Northwest Spring System is located and the property in which Conard’s Branch flows into Richland Creek. As part of the site remedy was the evaluation of target PCB fish tissue concentrations in both Conard’s Branch and Richland Creek to ensure protection of public health and the environment. Based on recent fish tissue sampling, CBS has met those target PCB fish tissue concentrations. Since no further response actions are needed and all the Remedial Action Objectives have been met, EPA is proposing to delist the Neal’s Landfill off the Superfund list. CBS will still be required to perform all operation and maintenance activities including operating the water treatment plant and performing all the necessary monitoring to ensure the remedy is still performing as designed and protective of public health and the environment.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)

### Sampling and Monitoring

### Green Remediation

Cleanup has also included interim control measures to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. The measures, put in place in 1987, included removal of visible capacitors and stained soils, a clay cap over primary landfill areas, fencing and access restrictions, removal of sediments and creek banks along Conard's Branch, and a spring water collection and activated carbon treatment system.
