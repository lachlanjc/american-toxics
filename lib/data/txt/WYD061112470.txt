### Background

The 140-acre Baxter/Union Pacific Tie Treating site is located along the Laramie River in Laramie, Wyoming. The Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) operated the plant for the treatment of railroad ties and other wood preserving operations on an intermittent basis from 1886 to 1983. Creosote was the primary wood preserving agent used; pentachlorophenol was also used for a limited time, but in smaller amounts.Historical spills and disposal practices contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Cleanup is ongoing under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) program, administered by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ). EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in December 1999.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. WDEQ oversees cleanup of the site.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Because the railroad operated the site under a RCRA permit, the site is subject to RCRA corrective action cleanup requirements. In 1988, EPA and the potentially responsible party (PRP) agreed on requirements for continuing site management under RCRA.

The site’s long-term remedy included continued operation of a contaminant isolation system to keep contaminants on site, a water treatment plant and three wells to remove contamination, continued removal of dense oily liquids from groundwater, removal of contaminated debris and soil, a topsoil cover on surface soils to prevent any exposure to remaining low-level soil contamination, continued monitoring of the test plots treating soils and debris through phytoremediation (use of native plants), and continued monitoring of the Integrated Phytoremediation/Greenbelt Project tied in with a recreational trail from Optimist Park to the site.

The greenbelt opened to the public in 2001. It includes a park, bike path and walkway linked to another park along the Laramie River. A portion of the original site is maintained for industrial use with restricted-access controls. Union Pacific bought the former Boyd property and filed a restrictive covenant to prevent installation of groundwater wells on the site.

WDEQ has determined that construction of all remedies is complete. Potential risks to wildlife are monitored. The final remedy is protective of human health and the environment. It will be reviewed under RCRA by WDEQ every five years.

EPA placed the site on the NPL in September 1983. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in December 1999.
