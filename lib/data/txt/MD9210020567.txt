Background
The U.S. Army Garrison Fort Meade is located in Anne Arundel County, Maryland (MD), along the Little Patuxent and Patuxent Rivers, midway between Baltimore, MD, and Washington, DC. The BRAC parcel is located south of the installation. The community of Odenton, MD, borders the eastern edge of FGGM. In general, the topography of FGGM is flat and gently slopes toward scattered water bodies throughout the installation. Local small-scale variations in elevation are abundant. Much of the installation topography has been altered by development.   FGGM began operation in 1917 as Camp Meade (Maryland Geological Society [MGS] 1917), a 4,000-acre World War I (WWI) training facility. Training activities included infantry combat operations. The U.S. Army Tank School operated at the facility from 1918 to 1932. The facility was renamed Fort George G. Meade in 1928. In 1941, the facility was expanded to 13,596 acres to accommodate the additional training requirements of World War II. In 1988, under BRAC, ranges and similar training areas were identified for closure. To date, 8,100 acres have been transferred to the DOI Patuxent Research Refuge (PRR) for use as a wildlife refuge: 7,600 acres in October 1991 and 500 acres in January 1993 as part of Defense Appropriation Bills for 1991 and 1992, respectively. The Army retained 900 acres of the BRAC parcel, which included the 366-acre Tipton Airfield (TAP). The Army began leasing the TAP to Anne Arundel County for use as a General Aviation Facility in 1998 and officially transferred the property to Anne Arundel County Tipton Airfield Authority in November 1999. After the 1988 BRAC realignment, the installation covered 5,067 acres (FGGM 2008). The current installation boundaries encompass the area previously referred to as the cantonment area, which is used for administrative, recreational, and housing facilities. FGGM contains approximately 65.5 miles of paved roads, 3.3 miles of secondary roads, and about 1,300 buildings. FGGM’s mission is to provide installation operations support for facilities and infrastructure, and quality of life and protective services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) activities and Federal agencies. The wide range of support is provided to 116 partner organizations from all four DoD military services, Homeland Security, and several Federal agencies. Major tenant units include the National Security Agency (NSA), the Defense Information School, Joint Field Support Center–U.S. Army Intelligence Security Command, the 70th Intelligence Wing (Air Force), the 902nd Military Intelligence Group (Army), Defense Information Systems Agency, Defense Media Agency, and EPA Research Laboratory. The site was added to the Superfund programs National Priorities List (NPL) in July 1998. EPA removed the TAP from the NPL listing in November 1999. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal actions. A September 2009 Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) between EPA and the Army identified areas for investigation and possible cleanup.  The FFA provided the framework and a schedule to accomplish this work.  Currently, there are 20 operable units being addressed under the Superfund program. EPA has signed Records of Decision (RODs) selecting remedies for 11 operable units: OU1:  Tipton Airfield – (BRAC) Fire Training Area, Helicopter Hangar Area, Inactive Landfill 3. A no further action alternative is the selected remedy for the Tipton Airfield. Past military training activities resulted in the presence of unexploded ordnance (UXO).   The HHRA showed acceptable risk and nsitutional Controls (ICs) were instituted for future land use. ROD was signed 12/30/1998. OU2:  Tipton Airfield – (BRAC) Inactive Landfill 1 and 2 were used as an unlined sanitary landfill from approximately 1950 to 1964. Remedy is soil and groundwater Land Use Controls (LUCs). ROD was signed 7/20/1999. OU7: Clean fill Dump – (BRAC) The remedy is NFA with monitoring and FYR’s. Site was used for the disposal of miscellaneous debris from 1972-1985. ROD was signed 9/20/2000 OU8: Ordnance Demolition Area – (BRAC) The remedy is monitored natural attenuation with institutional controls that limit the use of groundwater until remedial action objectives have been met. The ROD was signed on 9/30/11. OU9: Architect of the Capitol – The parcel was contaminated by past Army activities contaminants were lead in soil inorganics and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in shallow groundwater. The remedy is hot spot soil excavation with off-site disposal. The ROD was signed om  9/30/2014. OU12: Closed Sanitary Landfill (Cell 3) The Interim ROD remedy is land use controls, an active air-sparge system and continued post-closure care monitoring inititated through the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The interim ROD was signed on 3/31/2020. The final ROD will include Cells 1 and 2 and will address benzene and arsenic at the property boundary. OU13: Manor View Dump – The remedy in the ROD includes monitoring and maintenance of a soil cover, groundwater monitoring, soil gas methane monitoring, indoor air sampling and LUCs for methane in soil gas, metals and VOCs in soil and groundwater. ROD was signed on 9/30/2014. OU17: Pesticide Shop – The remedy implemented soil excavation with off-site disposal, enhance reductive dechlorination with LTM of groundwater and land use controls. Contaminants are VOCs and pesticides in soil and groundwater.  The ROD was signed on 9/27/2012’ OU18: Trap and Skeet Range (BRAC) – The remedy for the ROD was soil excavation and disposal of Munitions and Explosives of Concern (MEC) LUCs. Remediation included the excavation of 18,360 cubic yards of contaminated soil. The ROD was signed on 9/29/14.               OU20: Mortar Range – Soil and groundwater samples revealed no MEC contamination at the site. A no action ROD was signed on 9/27/12. OU21: High Explosive Impact Area (BRAC) - A Non-Time Critical Removal Action of MEC to a depth of 6 inches was conducted for 24 areas at the Patuxent Research Refuge North Tract identified by the Fish and Wildlife Service as high traffic areas. Instrument assisted sweeps of the 24 areas will be conducted every 5 years. The formal remedy was incorporated into the ROD that was signed on 12/20/2018. . Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
The Army has investigated and cleaned up multiple sites at Fort Meade. In 1999, EPA deleted part of the site from the NPL.  Currently, the Army is completing an investigation to determine the extent of PFAS compounds which have been found in the groundwater and may be present due to the use of AFFF firefighting foam and chromium plating activities.  Per the Federal Facilities Agreement between EPA, and the Department of the Army, a Site Management Plan (SMP) is annually updated with activities at each operable unit and area of concern. For detailed information on the current cleanup status, see the FGGM Site Management Plan. The Army, with EPA concurrence, has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedies. There are separate five-year reviews for the IRP and BRAC programs. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent reviews, conducted in was an independent EPA review that deferred the determination of whether the remedy selected by EPA continues to be protective of human health and the environment until the Army gathers more information on the ongoing emerging contaminants investigation.  The next Five-Year Review is scheduled for September 2026.  Top of Page
