### Background

The 58-acre Greenacres Landfill site is located near Liberty Lake, about 14 miles east of Spokane, Washington. Between 1951 and 1972, the site owner operated a landfill on site. The landfill accepted household, industrial and agricultural wastes. Site activities contaminated groundwater with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organics and heavy metals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Site comprises about 45 acres of land located approximately 14 miles east of Spokane, Washington within Section 16, Township 25 North, Range 45 East. The landfill is situated in a former ravine along the north slope of Carlson Hill. Refuse was placed on the surface, nearly filling the ravine. The nearby Spokane Valley contains the Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer (Spokane Aquifer), a sole source aquifer that provides water for municipal, industrial, and agricultural purposes, serving approximately 350,000 people. Greenacres Landfill was used as a municipal dump site under private ownership in the early 1940s. Greenacres Township was responsible for operating and regulating the site from 1951 to 1967. Spokane County acquired the landfill after dissolution of the Greenacres Township and operated it from 1967 to final closure in 1972. The land was then sold to Holiday Hills Development, Inc. (Liberty Lake Investments, Inc.), the current landowners. Ground water contamination at the site was identified in 1978 during a ground water monitoring survey. Water from a private well, located 600 feet from the base of the landfill, was found to be contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Spokane County provided an alternative source of drinking water to the affected residence. The site was placed on the National Priorities List in 1983. Installation of three monitoring wells in 1985 confirmed the landfill as the source of contamination. Through an agreement with EPA, the Washington Department of Ecology assumed lead agency status. Under Consent Order No. 87-0926, Spokane County began conducting the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) of the Site in 1988. The RI report was completed in November 1989 by Woodward-Clyde Consultants for Spokane County. Amendments to the Remedial Investigation and the Feasibility Study Report were completed in February, 1991 and March, 1991, respectively, by Woodward-Clyde Consultants for Spokane County. A Record of Decision addressing Operable Unit 1 was completed in December 1992.

The site is being addressed through state, federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The siteâ€™s long-term remedy included capping the landfill and long-term monitoring. Remedy construction took place between 1998 and 1999. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing.
