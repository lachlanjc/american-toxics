### Background

The 14-acre Green River Disposal, Inc. [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located along the Ohio River in a sparsely populated area of Daviess County, Kentucky, near the town of Maceo. Land use in the area ranges from forests to farmland and scattered residential development.

The site includes an area where operators buried various industrial wastes from 1975 to 1988. From 1975 to 1988, the facility held a disposal permit from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Between 1970 and 1984, operators buried various industrial wastes from nearby industries and businesses at the facility. Operators pushed wastes into ravines and covered them with soil. The facility had a history of leachate outbreaks and underground fires.

In 1984, the facility closed down. In 1985, state investigators found a contaminated private well next to the site. The site originally included the former Green River Disposal landfill and surrounding property. The site currently includes only the landfill and related leachate collection and treatment area.

In 2007 to 2008, Daviess County acquired a large portion of the site for potential use as a park.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1990 because of contaminated groundwater, leachate and sediment resulting from waste disposal operations. EPA, the [Kentucky Department for Environment Protection (KDEP)](http://dep.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx) and the site’s [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) have investigated site conditions. By monitoring and maintaining the landfill cap, enforcing institutional controls and conducting required Five-Year Reviews, EPA, KDEP and the site’s PRPs continue to protect people and the environment.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. Groundwater is not used for potable purposes at the site or in the vicinity of the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s PRPs led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and KDEP.

EPA often designates Operable Units (OUs) to more efficiently manage the cleanup activities. The Green River site has two designated OUs.

- OU-1 – landfill wastes and leachate and associated contaminated sediment
- OU-2 – Groundwater

**1994**  
EPA issued the cleanup plan for OU-1. It included

- capping the landfill area with a composite barrier cover
- collecting leachate with subsurface drains
- treating it and discharging treated water to a nearby stream
- digging up contaminated stream and pond sediment and consolidating it with the landfill waste
- removing surface debris and buried wastes in the east and west ravines
- disposing of the wastes beneath the landfill cap.

**1996 – 1997**  
The site’s PRPs began OU-1 cleanup activities in 1996 and completed them the following year.

**2000**  
EPA issued the cleanup plan for OU-2. It included

placing institutional controls in place to prohibit construction of any groundwater wells and construction of any structure on the landfill cap or within 50 feet of the cap  
developing and implementing a groundwater monitoring plan to evaluate performance of the landfill cap and leachate collection system.

**2002 – 2004**  
The PRPs began OU-2 cleanup activities in 2002 and in 2004 groundwater monitoring began.

**2010**  
The PRPs put institutional controls in place in 2010.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11166415.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2021. Because the remedies at 0U1 and 0U2 are currently protective of human health and the environment, the Site is protective in the short term.

The landfill cap effectively contains contaminants, prevents infiltration of stormwater and prevents direct contact or exposure of landfill waste by humans and fauna. The leachate collection system prevents migration of leachate off site or to surface water or groundwater. The institutional controls required by the 2000 cleanup plan have been established. Groundwater is not used for potable purposes at the site or in the vicinity of the site.

EPA plans to complete the next Five-Year Review in 2021. In the interim, the site's PRPs will continue to perform site operations and maintenance and monitoring activities.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

An environmental covenant (deed restriction) required by the 2000 cleanup plan in the has been established.

Groundwater is not used for potable purposes at the site or in the vicinity of the site.

Fencing surrounds the site.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRPs to investigate and clean up the site. The PRPs continue to fund monitoring and oversight activities.
