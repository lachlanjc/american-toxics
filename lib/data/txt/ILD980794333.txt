### Background

The LaSalle Electrical Utilities site is located in the city of LaSalle, in LaSalle County, Illinois. From about 1943 until 1982, a 68,000-square-foot industrial complex on site made capacitors for use in industrial applications and electrical power transmission. Plant operations contaminated soil and groundwater with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated solvents. The site’s long-term remedy is now in place. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions. The site is in the operation and maintenance phase. Illinois EPA is the lead agency.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued compliance with local ordinances is needed to prevent exposure to contaminated groundwater until the remedy is complete.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s cleanup took place in three phases, following initial actions by EPA from 1983 to 1985 to secure the site, consolidate drummed wastes and control off-site migration of surface water.

In Phase I, Illinois EPA removed 23,258 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated soil from private yards, road shoulders, agricultural fields, and adjoining business properties. A thermal treatment unit on site processed the soils. PCBs were stripped from the soil and thermally destroyed. Residents of 26 homes were relocated for up to six weeks while soil was excavated from the yards. The homes were industrially cleaned. Over 100 other homes had partial removal of yards or curbs to address sidewalk soils.

Phase II activities took place from the summer of 1990 to the winter of 1994. The industrial complex was demolished, structural steel was decontaminated for recycling, non-thermally destructible material was shipped for off-site disposal, and PCB-contaminated soil, building demolition debris and contaminated stream sediments were thermally destroyed.

Phase III focused on groundwater cleanup. The site’s groundwater collection and treatment system started operating in the spring of 1995. To accelerate cleanup, a soil vapor extraction system was installed in 2002. Phytoremediation in select locations enhanced removal of VOCs from clay soils. Phytoremediation uses plants to clean up contaminated environments.
