Background
The 1-acre Chemical & Minerals Reclamation, Inc. (CMR) site is located in Cleveland, Ohio. CMR planned to use the site as a recycling facility. However, the area was only used to collect and store wastes in vats and barrels. The vats and barrels contained miscellaneous wastes, including flammable and nonflammable solvents, paints, tar, grease and resins. Storage operations continued until July 2, 1980, when a fire occurred at the warehouse on site. As a result of the fire, the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway was closed temporarily; no injuries were reported. The City of Cleveland, the U. S. Coast Guard, Ohio EPA and EPA have all participated in the cleanup of the site. Cleanup finished in 1982.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site was addressed through federal, state and local actions.

What Is the Current Site Status?
Site cleanup consisted of a series of removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment.In 1981, 2,000 containers of flammable and non-flammable solvents, paints, tar, grease, resins and other wastes were removed, along with liquid and solid materials from six 3,500-gallon vats. Further action included compatibility testing of chemicals and the removal of chemicals to various recyclers, incinerators and landfills. The building on site was demolished. Visibly contaminated soil was taken to a licensed landfill. Cleanup finished in 1982.According to a December 1982 Federal Register notice, EPA decided not to list the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL), stating that the criteria for deletion from the NPL had already been met and all appropriate cleanup had been completed. EPA and the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) signed a Consent Decree in 1987 that recovered more than 85 percent of EPA's cleanup costs at the time.
