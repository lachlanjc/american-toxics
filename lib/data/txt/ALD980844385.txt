### Background

The Redwing Carriers, Inc. (Saraland) site includes the area where Redwing Carriers operated a trucking company from 1961 to 1971. In 1973, the area was redeveloped into an apartment complex. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1990 because of contaminated groundwater, sediment and soil resulting from trucking company operations. EPA, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) and the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) have investigated site conditions and have taken all necessary Remedial Actions for the site. The Site was deleted from the NPL September 2015 and has no restrictions or requirements for further Five Year Reviews.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s PRPs lead cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and ADEM.

Between 1985 and 1994, Redwing Carriers, Inc. conducted periodic cleanups at the site. Beginning in 1996, EPA took over cleanup activities. EPA relocated 57 residents temporarily in 1996 and then permanently in 1997. EPA also dug up and disposed of 20,724 tons of sludge, contaminated soil and debris off site.

In 2004, the site’s PRPs removed the Saraland apartment buildings, foundations, concrete walkways, asphalt driveways and parking areas. The PRPs completed soil contamination cleanup in 2007 and 2008. PRPs removed 25,114 cubic yards of soil. The PRPs backfilled and graded the dug-up areas and installed six monitoring wells on site. PRPs conducted groundwater sampling in 2008. In 2009, the PRPs installed three additional monitoring wells on a property next to the site.

The 2014 FYR determined that the site was eligible for deletion since all requirements of the ROD were satisfied and the site hadbeen remediated to allow for unlimited use or unrestricted exposure” (UU/UE). This site was deleted from the NPL in September 2015.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/10985324.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2014. The remedy at the Site is protective of human health and the environment because the surface soil, subsurface soil, sediment and ground water at the Site met performance standards established in the RODs and the Explanation of Significant Difference (ESD). The policy requirement for the five-year review has been met and will be discontinued.
