### Background

The Computer Circuits site is in an industrial park in Hauppauge, New York. Computer Circuits Corporation operated a circuit board manufacturing facility from 1969 to 1977, and discharged industrial wastewaters into industrial cesspools on site. The industrial wastewaters discharged by the facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with copper and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs are potentially harmful contaminants that easily evaporate in the air. VOC contaminants (in particular, trichloroethylene (TCE)) were also identified at levels of concern in indoor air. Contaminants in groundwater and indoor air posed a risk to human health.

The Computer Circuits site consists of a one story building, approximately 21,600 square feet in size, located on a 1.7 acre lot in an industrial/commercial area of Hauppauge, Suffolk County, New York. It is bordered by Marcus Boulevard to the west and other commercial businesses to the north, south, and east. MCS Realty owned and leased the property to various companies from 1969 to 1991. 145 Marcus Blvd, Inc. has owned the property since 1991. Computer Circuits Corporation occupied the entire property from 1969 to 1977. The site is currently occupied by several other, non-manufacturing businesses.

Computer Circuits manufactured printed circuit boards for both military and commercial applications. Waste liquids from the manufacturing process were discharged to five cesspools located to the southeast of the building and one cesspool on the north side of the building. On numerous occasions between 1976 and 1977, the Suffolk County Department of Environmental Control collected samples from the cesspools, and found that copper and lead were consistently detected at levels above the permit limits. An inspection conducted in 1976 revealed that the site was littered with trash, broken barrels, and spilled piles of chemicals and blue/green colored sludges. Chemical analysis of groundwater samples taken from monitoring wells at the site indicated the presence of significant levels of copper and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The Computer Circuits site overlies an interconnected aquifer system consisting of the Upper Glacial Aquifer and the deeper Magothy Formation. All nearby residents obtain their drinking water from public supply wells with 60 municipal wells located within four miles of the site. The site is located over a New York State designated Wellhead Protection Area. This site is being addressed through Federal and Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) actions.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The owner of the site installed and operated a soil-vapor extraction (SVE) system on the north side of the on-site building to remove site-related volatile organic compounds from a source area and to mitigate the migration of these contaminants into the building in 2005. EPA installed an additional soil-vapor extraction system on the south side of the on-site building to remove site-related volatile organic compounds from a source area and to mitigate the migration of these contaminants into the building in September 2008. The owner of the property continues to operate both soil-vapor extraction systems pursuant to the Record of Decision (ROD).

The SVE/Vapor mitigation systems have been, and continue to be, operated as designed, and continue to be an effective remedy. By removing contaminants from the former source area, levels of contaminants in groundwater steadily decreased below Maximum Contaminant Levels established in the Safe Drinking Water Act. As such, cleanup objectives have been achieved for groundwater. In addition, the owner of the site performs periodic indoor air monitoring. Indoor air monitoring data continues to reflect that indoor air is safe and that contaminant levels do not exceed levels of concern. EPA conducted a Five Year Review (FYR) of the site in 2021 to evaluate the implementation and performance of the remedy. Based on the FYR, EPA determined that the remedy is and will continue to be protective of human health and the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Remediation at the site has been addressed in two phases, namely, a response phase to remediate soil contamination in a source area and a long-term remedial phase focusing on cleanup of the entire site (soils, and groundwater), and mitigating vapor intrusion into the building. Response Action Status: The owner of the site is currently operating two soil-vapor extraction systems to remove site-related volatile organic compounds (primarily trichloroethylene) from two different source areas and to mitigate the migration of these contaminants into the building. Previous Actions: The cesspools on the southeast side of the building were excavated and backfilled by Computer Circuits in 1976 and 1977. In addition, approximately four inches of sediments were removed from the cesspool on the north side of the building. Entire Site: The property owner performed a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS), which assessed the nature and extent of contamination and identified alternatives to address it; this work was initiated in November, 2001 and was completed in 2007. A Record of Decision, which states the remedial actions to be taken at the site, was issued on September 30, 2008. The owner of the property is implementing the remedy. EPA is evaluating the progress of the remedial action and preparing the Remedial Action Report. Presently, the PRP is considering a modification to the vapor extraction systems to further address the sub-slab vapor contamination.
