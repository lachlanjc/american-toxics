Background
The Municipality of Juncos, Puerto Rico, owns the site property. It operated the landfill between 1957 and 1977. The landfill closed in 1981. In addition to municipal wastes, the landfill contains broken and intact mercury thermometers. Becton Dickinson (BD) Puerto Rico, Inc., one of the site’s potentially responsible parties, manufactured the thermometers. EPA started sampling activities at the site in April 1982, with a follow-up site inspection in September 1983. During the site inspection, EPA detected mercury in the air and soil in the southwest portion of the landfill, in off-site leachate samples, and in soil samples collected in gardens and behind homes next to the site. After site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983. The Juncos Landfill is located in Juncos, Puerto Rico. The 11-acre area is a closed municipal landfill.
Municipal wastes, including mercury thermometers, were disposed of at the site from 1957 to 1977. The landfill closed in 1981. Landfill operations contaminated the soil, off-site leachate and air with mercury and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are potentially harmful contaminants that easily evaporate in the air. Following immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, EPA put the site’s long-term remedy in place. Under current conditions, potential or actual human exposures are under control. Long-term groundwater monitoring is ongoing.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Immediate Actions: The site’s potentially responsible parties posted signs and installed a partial fence to restrict access to the site. They also covered the landfill and the discarded mercury-containing thermometers with topsoil. These actions greatly reduced the potential for exposure to hazardous materials during the site’s long-term cleanup. Landfill Cleanup: Following a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the nature and extent of site contamination and to evaluate remedial alternatives, EPA selected the landfill remedy in the site’s September 1991 Record of Decision, or ROD. The remedy included landfill closure with construction of a single barrier cap with a geomembrane liner, installation of a security fence around the perimeter of the landfill and placement of institutional controls to ensure the integrity of the cap. As part of the remedy, EPA also began acquiring residential properties near the site and relocated residents from late 1998 until mid-2003. Groundwater Cleanup: EPA selected the site’s groundwater remedy in the site’s October 1993 ROD. The remedy selected was no further action for groundwater, the use of monitored natural attenuation, placement of institutional controls and groundwater monitoring. Natural attenuation describes a variety of in-place processes that, under favorable conditions, act without human intervention to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume or concentration of contaminants in groundwater.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site is being addressed in three stages: immediate actions and two long-term remedial phases focused on cleanup of the landfill and contaminated groundwater. The potentially responsible parties began a study in 1984 to evaluate the nature and extent of the contamination associated with the landfill wastes. The work was completed in 1991. On September 24, 1991, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for the first OU. The remedial alternative selection for OU-1 was closure the landfill by construction of single barrier cap with geomembrane liner, the installation of a security fence around the perimeter of the landfill and the place of institutional controls on the landfill property. The Remedial Investigation conducted to determine the nature and extent of groundwater contamination at the site was completed on March 19, 1992. On October 5, 1993, the EPA issued a ROD for the second OU. The remedial alternative selected for OU-2 was no action for the groundwater, the promotion of the natural attenuation, to place institutional controls and development groundwater monitoring. The ROD selected remedy includes the Temporary Relocation of 21 families living in homes located along the immediate north face of the Landfill, during the construction phase of this remedy. On February 23, 1999, EPA signed an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) to change the relocation of families from temporary to permanent. The permanent relocation was completed by the end of February 2003. Institutional controls are under development. Long-term groundwater monitoring is ongoing. Groundwater monitoring data indicated that the groundwater off-site meets primary MCLs standards. There are exceedences in Mn, but that is a secondary standard and not critical to human health. Since groundwater off the property meets MCLs there is no need for institutional controls to limit its use. However, Commonwealth laws and regulations currently do restrict groundwater withdrawals, well drilling and required use of a public supply.
