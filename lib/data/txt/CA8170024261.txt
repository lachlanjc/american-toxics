### Background

The Barstow Marine Corps Logistics Base site covers 5,687 acres east of Barstow, California. The site consists of three areas: the Nebo area, the Yermo area and the Rifle Range. The base has two major functions: providing equipment maintenance, repair, overhaul and rebuilding, and receiving, storing, maintaining, issuing and shipping materials. Consequently, most of the wastes historically generated by the base have been vehicle-related and war surplus. Investigations by the Marine Corps have found 38 areas of contamination on the base. Site investigations and cleanup are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.

By providing an alternate drinking water supply to base personnel, the potential for exposure to contaminants in the groundwater has been reduced while investigations continue and final cleanup activities are being planned for the site.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

An alternate drinking water supply has been provided for personnel on the base. One drinking water well is being treated. Contaminated sludges in old wastewater lagoons were excavated and treated in 1993. There have been two immediate actions taken for persons living on property adjacent to the base whose groundwater wells may have been impacted by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) coming from base sources. In one case, a family was connected to the Southern California Water Company so they would not be required to use groundwater from their residential well. In the other case, two families had carbon-filtered systems installed on their wells to remove VOCs. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-impacted soil was removed from the Industrial Waste Disposal Area on base in late 1997.
