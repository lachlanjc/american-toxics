### Background

**Background**  
The site is located in Cibola County, New Mexico, approximately 5.5 miles north of the Village of Milan, at the intersection of Highway 605 and Country Road 63I. The site includes the former uranium mill site, two tailing disposal sites (impoundments), and the impacted portions of the underlying ground water aquifers, known locally as the San Mateo alluvial aquifer and the Upper, Middle and Lower Chinle aquifers.

Uranium milling operations at the site began in 1958 under a license issued by the Atomic Energy Commission. Operations were originally conducted by two distinct partnerships, the Homestake- Sapin Partners and the Homestake-New Mexico. The Homestake-New Mexico Partnership dissolved in 1961, and the property was ultimately acquired by the Homestake-Sapin Partners. The name of the partnership was changed in 1968 to United Nuclear-Homestake Partners. In 1981, Homestake Mining Company purchased United Nuclear Corporation’s interest, and the name changed to Homestake Mining Company - Grants. On December 4, 2001, HMC merged with Barrick Gold Corporation, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Barrick Gold Corporation (NRC 2002).

The large tailings impoundment covers an area of about 200 acres and is approximately 85 - 100 feet high. It contains an estimated 21 million tons of mill tailings. The small tailings impoundment covers an area of about 40 acres and is 20 - 25 feet high. It contains approximately 1.2 million tons of mill tailings. Seepage from the two tailings impoundments has resulted in the contamination of the underlying groundwater aquifers.

The current remediation system consists of a groundwater collection and injection system, a 1200 gallons per minute (gpm) reverse osmosis (RO) water treatment facility, a 1500 gpm zeolite water treatment system, two lined collection ponds, three lined evaporation ponds, a groundwater collection system for areas outside the facility’s licensed boundary and associated equipment and structures.

The primary contaminants and constituents of concern that are present in the ground water at the Site are uranium, selenium, radium-226 + radium-228, thorium-230, chromium, molybdenum, vanadium, sulfate, chloride, nitrate, and total dissolved solids (TDS) (Hydro-Engineering 2006). Radium-226 was the primary contaminant of concern present in the soil.

The major land use immediately proximal to the Site consists of residential development. There are five residential subdivisions located south and southwest of the mill site: Felice Acres, Broadview Acres, Murray Acres, Pleasant Valley Estates, and Valle Verde. Land near the Site is also used for agricultural and livestock purposes. Much of the land immediately surrounding the mill site to the north, east and west has been acquired over the years by HMC, and this property has not been put into use, except for installation of some infiltration trenches as a part of the ground water restoration program.

The site consists of three operable units (OUs). OU1 addresses groundwater restoration; OU2 addresses long-term tailings stabilization, surface reclamation and site closure; and OU3 addresses radon concentrations in the neighboring subdivisions. EPA issued a No Action ROD for OU3 in 1989 and is currently performing a Superfund (CERCLA) RI/FS equivalency analysis for OU1 and OU2. EPA plans to issue a ROD for OU1 and OU2 after it completes the Superfund RI/FS equivalency analysis.

Homestake is performing remediation under the NRC's authority for license termination. In light of the overlapping UMTRCA and Superfund regulatory authorities, EPA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with NRC in 1993 to define the roles and responsibilities of the two agencies. The NRC was designated as the lead regulatory agency for the byproduct material (tailings) disposal area reclamation and closure activities, and EPA will monitor all activities and provide review and comment to the NRC to assure that activities to be conducted under the NRC's regulatory authority will allow attainment of applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements under the Superfund law outside of the byproduct material disposal site. However, each agency is responsible for assuring compliance with its specific regulatory requirements. If EPA determines that response actions conducted under the NRC's regulatory authority are deficient or unsatisfactory, then EPA shall provide notice to NRC of the deficiency. Should compliance with Superfund requirements not be acheived within a specified time period, EPA will assume the lead for taking or seeking any enforcement action within its area of regulatory responsibility. Both agencies reserve all rights under the MOU to take whatever actions are determined to be necessary, including the conduct of remedial actions within and outside of the byproduct disposal area, in order to fulfill their regulatory requirements.

**Benefits**  
The initial action to connect the nearby residences to the municipal water supply provided a safe drinking water supply. In addition, the study on indoor radon levels showed that site contamination was not contributing to elevated indoor radon levels found in some area homes.  
The contaminant plume has receded back almost 3/4 mile into the site boundaries by injecting fresh water down-gradient of the site. Nearly 4.5 billion gallons of contaminated water have been removed and 540 million gallons of treated water has been injected into the aquifer. The NRC is requiring that the Corrective Action Plan include clean-up of off-site contamination and require that the license be amended accordingly as well.

Reverse gradient injection has assured that contaminants in the ground water would not expand into the shallow aquifer, thus making the shallow water potentially usable in the down gradient areas. Once the tailings piles have been closed, the site will be transferred to DOE under general license.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is the lead agency for the site.

The initial action to connect nearby residences to the municipal water supply provided a safe drinking water supply. In addition, the study on indoor radon levels showed that contamination was not contributing to elevated indoor radon levels found in some area homes.

The contaminant plume has receded back almost three-quarters of a mile into the site boundaries by injecting fresh water downgradient of the site. Approximately 317 million gallons of treated water were injected into the aquifers in 2019.

The NRC is requiring that the Corrective Action Plan include cleanup of off-site contamination and that the license be amended accordingly. Reverse gradient injection has ensured that contaminants in the groundwater will not expand into the shallow aquifer, thus making the shallow water potentially usable in the downgradient areas. Once the tailings piles have been closed, the site will be transferred to the Department of Energy (DOE) under general license.

EPA has conducted five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy, exclusive of OU-3, continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The protectiveness determination for OU-3 was deferred pending completion of EPA’s ongoing risk assessment. The five-year review also identified a number of issues and recommendations for each of the OUs at the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Work continues on the Superfund remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) equivalency analysis for response actions performed at the site under the NRC's Source Materials License SUA-1471 pursuant to the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) and the NMED's Groundwater Discharge Permit DP-200 pursuant to the New Mexico Water Quality Act. The Superfund RI/FS equivalency process is being conducted to assess if the response actions completed at the site conform with the Superfund requirements for investigation, risk assessment, and remedy selection. If these activities substantially comply with the Superfund requirements, it will demonstrate equivalency to a Superfund quality remedy. If they do not, then additional work will be necessary to achieve equivalency. An equivalency determination will support deletion from the National Priorities List (NPL) of Superfund sites when the cleanup is completed.

The RI and risk assessment were completed in June 2020 and are documented in the Final RI Report, dated June 22, 2020. On August 12, 2020, EPA and Homestake signed an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (ASACO) for Homestake to perform the FS. A revised draft Development and Screening of Remedial Alternatives Memorandum was submitted to EPA in April 2020 and is currently under review. The development and screening of remedial alternatives (cleanup options) is the first phase of the FS. The second phase of the FS will be the detailed analysis of the cleanup options carried forward from the development phase. The detailed analysis will be performed by comparing the cleanup options to several criteria of Superfund and the NCP, including protectiveness, ability to attainment Superfund requirements, effectiveness, implementability and cost. Following completion of the FS, EPA will release a Proposed Plan for public review and comment that describes EPA's preferred remedy and the other cleanup options evaluated. After the completion of a formal public comment period and public meeting, EPA will assess all comments received from the public and then select a remedy in a record of decision that best meets the Superfund criteria.

In May 2023, EPA completed a [background groundwater re-assessment](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/06/100029478.pdf) at the Site as part of the onoging RI/FS process. The purpose of this re-assessment was to verify if the previous background concentrations approved by the NRC for certain contaminants are still appropriate. Background refers to concentrations of a contaminant that are not caused by releases at a site. Such concentrations could be naturally occurring (natural background) or caused by other human activity not related to the site (anthropogenic background). If background concentrations in groundwater are above federal drinking water standards or state groundwater standards, then the background concentrations are generally selected as cleanup levels for a site by EPA. Once EPA determines background, then preliminary remediation goals (federal/state standards or background) can be established as part of the RI/FS. In 2006, NRC and NMED approved background concentrations for uranium, selenium, and other constituents as the site groundwater cleanup levels for the Site that because they were determined to be higher than federal or state standards. Additional information obtained by EPA since 2006 has led EPA to perform the reassessment.

EPA initially engaged the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to initiate the background reassessment. The USGS published two journal papers on its findings in 2019: "Differentiating Anthropogenic and Natural Sources of Uranium by Geochemical Fingerprinting of Groundwater at the Homestake Uranium Mill, Milan, New Mexico, USA" (Blake, J.M., et. al) and "Identifying Natural and Anthropogenic Variability of Uranium at the Well Scale, Homestake Superfund Site, near Milan, New Mexico, USA" (Harte, P.T., et. al). Homestake also initiated a background reassessment at the same time. Homestake's work specifically evaluated the degree to which naturally occurring mineral sources of uranium potentially contributed to the anomalously high concentrations of uranium in the groundwater upgradient of the site at monitoring well DD. The results of Homestake's reassessment are presented in two reports prepared by Homestake's consultant, Arcadis U.S., Inc. (Arcadis): a white paper entitled "Evaluation of Water Quality in Regards to Site Background Standards at the Grants Reclamation Project," dated September 2018, and the "Grants Reclamation Project 2019 Supplemental Background Soil and Groundwater Investigation Report." The conclusions presented in the Arcadis reports state that the high uranium concentrations in the groundwater were sourced from the natural uranium minerals in the alluvial aquifer sediments.

After Homestake completed its reassessment, NMED performed a geochemical modeling study using PHREEQC modeling software to evaluate if the high uranium concentration found in alluvial groundwater at monitoring well DD was sourced from the historical mine water discharges that were released from the legacy uranium mines that operated in the Ambrosia Lake valley from about 1956 to 1981. Based on studies by EPA and New Mexico in the late 1970s and mid-1980s, the mine water discharges were known to contain high levels of uranium and other constituents. The results of the NMED geochemical modeling study indicate that mine water discharges likely contributed to the high uranium concentrations at well DD. The results are presented in the NMED report entitled: "Geochemical Conceptual Site Model and Batch-Equilibrium Modeling of Alluvial Groundwater at Monitoring Well DD, Homestake National Priorities List Site, Cibola and McKinley Counties, New Mexico," dated September 11, 2020. The NMED study has been provided to BVDA, MASE, NRC, the Department of Energy and Homestake. Comments on the NMED study were provded by Homestake on October 30, 2020. They are currently being reviewed by EPA and NMED.

On October 7, 2020, EPA Headquarters (HQ) selected the site's ongoing Superfund RI/FS equivalency process to be reviewed by the EPA National Remedy Review Board (NRRB). The NRRB was formed in 1996 to consult and advise on some of the Superfund program's most complex remedy decisions to ensure national consistency in remedy selection. For the site, the NRRB will provide a focused technical review of the scoping and initial phase of the FS as it relates to the development and screening of remedial alternatives. That will be followed by the NRRB's review of the detailed analysis of the alternatives, if needed. This will allow the NRRB to work with the Region in developing the range of remedial alternatives to be evaluated and provide feedback to the Region through remedy selection. The NRRB involvement will result in a more collaborative remedy development process that helps facilitate early stakeholder engagement and improved national consistency. In June 2021, the NRRB issued a [memo](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/06/100023772.pdf) detailing recommendations.

Homestake submitted draft plans for characterizing the San Andres and Glorieta (SAG) aquifer to EPA on October 15, 2020. The purpose of the SAG investigation is to characterize the physical and geochemical properties of the SAG aquifer in the area where the SAG is in contact with the overlying alluvial aquifer (subcrop area). The information will be used to more fully characterize the fate and transport of contaminants that are present in the allluvial aquifer downgradient from the tailing impoundments and the potential for their migration to the SAG at the subcrop area. The subcrop area represents an area where there may be a hydraulic connection. In other words, allluvial groundwater may be flowing into the SAG aquifer at the subcrop area. At this time, there is no data to suggest that the site has impacted the SAG aquifer. EPA approved the SAG characterization plans on October 29, 2020, and the field investigation began the same week.

Based on additional information from the work that EPA has completed in the San Mateo basin in the past few years and historic information provided by the community, the EPA is performing this assessment. Data from this groundwater assessment efforts will help EPA understand the nature of contamination; and provide additional lines of evidence to determine if the background levels of uranium is natural or impacted by milling operation. EPA has engaged the United States Geological Service (USGS) to perform the investigation related to this work. USGS has published the data on the USGS ScienceBase webpage and plans to publish the findings in a technical journal. EPA will use this technical report and also seek comments from stakeholders before making any decision regarding the background and cleanup standard at the Site.

EPA initiated the fifth five-year review of the site in September 2020. The purpose of the five-year review is to determine if the remedy is currently protective. A public notice was mailed to individuals on EPA's mailinig list. It was also placed in the Cibola Beacon newspaper on September 29, 2020. The review will include interviews of community members and other key stakeholders to record their opinions on the cleanup. It will also include a site inspection. EPA is planning to conduct virtual interviews in November/December 2020. The five-year review will be completed in September 2021.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Field activities are currently being conducted by Homestake, with EPA and NMED oversight, to test the groundwater aquifers at the site. The work began on September 7, 2023, and will continue through November of this year. The work includes the drilling of boreholes to collecting sediment samples for laboratory testing. The boreholes and laboratory tests will help EPA and NMED determine if an aquifer condition known as “back diffusion” is present at the site that may limit the ability to successfully clean up groundwater. Back diffusion is a condition where contaminants that are bound up in fine-grained clay layers are slowly released back into adjacent coarser-grained layers of sand and gravel, where groundwater flows more easily and can be affected by pumping operations designed to clean up the aquifers. The continual slow release of the bound-up contaminants in the clays to the more flowing zones of groundwater causes a rebound (increase) of contaminant levels in the flowing zones. This condition can extend the length of time to complete a groundwater cleanup for decades or even centuries.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1985 and 2009, Homestake provided an alternative water supply to nearby residents. EPA also installed radon mitigation systems in homes where indoor radon exceeded the EPA guidance level. The source of radon is still unknown.
