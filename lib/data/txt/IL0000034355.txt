### Background

The Old American Zinc Plant site is a former zinc smelting facility located at 2575 Kings Highway in Fairmont, Illinois. Zinc smelting operations primarily occurred on the 132-acre facility from 1913 to 1953. Before American Zinc discontinued all operations in 1967, limited activities such as roasting ores and sulfuric acid production were conducted at the site. Slag generated during the smelter's operations was deposited at the former facility in a molten state and allowed to cool over time. This process, known as vitrification, converted the slag into a glassy substance. EPA has anecdotally been informed that the vitrified slag was later transported from the former facility for use as fill and surfacing material in the surrounding area. Subsequent sampling events appear to confirm this past occurrence.

Illinois EPA began investigating the site in 1994 after complaints about dust. The state agency found no evidence of airborne contamination but did find high levels of lead, arsenic, cadmium and zinc in soil samples. Waste and sediment (mud) samples taken on and near the site also showed inorganic and pesticide contamination.

Illinois asked U.S. EPA’s assistance to deal with potential threats from hazardous waste at the site. In 1999, U.S. EPA conducted a follow-up assessment at the location. Data from that study indicated high lead levels that exceeded the safety limits for lead in residential and industrial parcels.

In 2002 and 2003, a potentially responsible party (PRP), Blue Tee, Inc., removed residential soils as part of a non-time-critical removal to address elevated levels of lead. Following the Blue Tee, Inc.’s removal action, a group of PRP conducted a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study to assess the extent of contamination and potential cleanup remedies. The purpose of the remedial investigation is to gather data to characterize site conditions and determine the nature and extent of contamination at the site. The Feasibility Study is used for the development, screening, and evaluation of options for cleanup actions. In September 2012, EPA issued a Record of Decision describing its selected remedial cleanup actions for the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In April 2016, U.S. EPA added the Old American Zinc site to the National Priorities List. The NPL is the list of hazardous waste sites in the United States that are eligible for long-term remedial action and federal funding under the Superfund law. The Superfund law is what gives EPA the authority to clean up releases of hazardous substances.

U.S. EPA signed a [Record of Decision](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/441996.pdf) [(pdf)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/441996.pdf) (99 pp) in 2012 that outlines the cleanup plan at the Old American Zinc Plant site. The selected remedy at the site involves excavation of contaminated soil inside and outside of the facility area; consolidation and capping of contaminated soil on the facility property; groundwater monitoring; and use of institutional controls that limit future use of the property.

In 2019, U.S. EPA, in consultation with Illinois EPA, changed the Old American Zinc Superfund site cleanup plan. These changes are summarized the [Explanation of Significant Differences (pdf)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/947987.pdf) (21 pp) The federal Agency’s revised plan called for an increase in the estimated cost of the remedy selected. U.S. EPA also added institutional and engineering controls for additional areas of the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has completed the first five-year review of the Old American Zinc Plant Superfund site. Cleanup at the site is ongoing, but the Superfund law requires a review be completed within five years from the start of the cleanup. This is the first five-year review of this site.

EPA’s ongoing cleanup at the site consists of excavation of contaminated soil in residential yards, backfilling with clean fill, and restoration of the properties. EPA has also dug up contaminated soil at the former facility area. The excavated material will be consolidated on the former facility property and covered with a protective cover.

### Emergency Response and Removal

In 2018, U.S. EPA conducted a time-critical removal action to address properties where very high levels of contamination were identified. U.S. EPA cleaned up approximately 65 properties which contained lead- and arsenic-contaminated slag.
