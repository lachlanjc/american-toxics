### Background

The DuPage County Landfill/Blackwell Forest Preserve site is a former 40-acre landfill in a 1,200-acre forest preserve. The landfill is located near Warrenville in DuPage County, Illinois. DuPage County Forest Preserve District (FPD) purchased the 40-acre site property in 1960, and later purchased the surrounding 1,100 acres. The Blackwell Forest Preserve is an open space containing woodlands, grasslands, wetlands and lakes used by the public for recreation. Following cleanup, long-term monitoring and operation and maintenance of the site’s leachate treatment system are ongoing.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

Earlier response actions included landfill cap repairs, as necessary, enhancing surface drainage, putting in a leachate treatment system, disposing of the landfill leachate, installing additional landfill gas vents and monitoring groundwater. Long-term monitoring and operation and maintenance of the leachate treatment system will occur for the foreseeable future (at least 20 years).

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s final remedy is in place. EPA selected the remedy in 1998. It focused on operation and maintenance of previously implemented response actions as well as additional response actions, including monitored natural attenuation of groundwater. Natural attenuation describes a variety of in-place processes that, under favorable conditions, act without human intervention to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume or concentration of contaminants in groundwater. In 2001, the landfill gas venting system was reconfigured to vent all landfill gas through one stack at the top of the landfill.

Actions are underway to delist the site from the NPL.  

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
