### Background

The Lehillier/Mankato site is located in Blue Earth County, Minnesota. Uncontrolled dumping occurred at the 1,000-acre site until 1972. In the early 1980s, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) sampled domestic wells and confirmed volatile organic compound (VOC) contamination of groundwater in the area. A number of small dumps were known to exist in the area, but a specific source of the contamination was not found.

Several residential wells were impacted as well as one of the municipal wells for Mankato, a city of 30,000 people. The city's well is directly downgradient and less than one-quarter mile from the VOC plume. The surficial aquifer, which is the impacted aquifer at the site, is the drinking water source for Mankato. No contamination has been detected to date in the municipal well near the site. A new municipal well was recently constructed approximately one-quarter mile to the north of the contamination. Both municipal wells draw from the shallow aquifer.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

EPA and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) have conducted several five-year reviews of the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place continue to protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Long-term remedies implemented at the site included a groundwater extraction and treatment system which operated between 1989 and 1997. Additional remedies also included proper abandonment of 83 private wells and institutional controls for future land use. There are currently ongoing operation and maintenance activities at the site.

Additional actions at the site prior to the long-term remedies included provision of clean water to LeHillier residents. In 1983, residents were provided with bottled water until 1985 when the town received public water supply connections paid for through a U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department grant.
