### Background

The Industri-Plex Superfund Site is a former chemical and glue manufacturing facility. Industri-plex was used for manufacturing chemicals such as lead-arsenic insecticides, acetic acid, and sulfuric acid for local textile, leather, and paper manufacturing industries from 1853 to 1931. Chemicals manufactured by other industries at the site include phenol, benzene, and toluene. Industri-plex was also used to manufacture glue from raw animal hide and chrome-tanned hide wastes from 1934 to 1969. The by-products and residues from these industries caused the soils within the site to become contaminated with elevated levels of metals, such as arsenic, lead and chrome. During the 1970s, the site was developed for industrial use. Excavations uncovered and mixed industrial by-products and wastes accumulated over 130 years. During this period, residues from animal hide wastes used in the manufacture of glue were relocated on-site from buried pits to piles near swampy areas on the property. Many of the animal hide piles and lagoons on-site were leaching toxic metals into the environment. In the 1980's, the site contained streams and ponds, a warehouse and office buildings, remnant manufacturing buildings, and hide waste deposits buried on the site. Animal hide residues are found on approximately 20 acres of the site in four different piles. Portions of the animal hide piles sloughed off, causing the release of hydrogen sulfide gases to the atmosphere and toxic metals to surrounding wetlands. Residences are located within 1,000 feet of the site, and more than 34,000 people live within 3 miles of the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed in three stages: initial actions and two long-term remedial phases focusing on site stabilization and cleanup of groundwater contamination.

**Initial Action**  
In 1986, the EPA installed 10,000 feet of fence to restrict site access. Extensive damage to the main areas of the fence occurred, and drums were dumped illegally on the site. Areas of the fence requiring repairs were identified by the EPA, and work to re-secure the site was completed in 1988. Warning signs also were posted.

**Site Stabilization (Operable Unit 1, OU-1)**  
In 1986, the EPA selected a [cleanup remedy](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/14846) that is being implemented by the potentially responsible parties (PRPs). The remedy includes the following: 1) Design and construct permeable caps over approximately 105 acres of soils and sediments contaminated with lead, arsenic, and chromium in excessive levels of 300 parts per million (ppm), 600 ppm, and 1000 ppm, respectively. The permeable caps may consist of various designed covers containing 16 inches of clean fill and a geotextile fabric placed over the contaminated soils and sediments, as well as equivalent covers such as concrete foundations or bituminous parking lots. This portion of the remedy serves to prevent physical contact with the contaminated soils and sediments, including the West, East-Central and South Hide Piles; 2) Design and construct an impermeable cap over the approximately 5 acres of East Hide Pile, and gas collection and treatment system. This portion of the remedy serves to prevent the infiltration of water through the hide pile, and prevent the release of hydrogen sulfide gas into the atmosphere; 3) Design and construct an interim groundwater treatment system to treat a groundwater hot spot contaminated with toluene and benzene. This interim system is designed to reduce the concentration of the hot spot by eighty percent and limit contamination migration off-site; 4) Conduct a Groundwater and Surface Water Investigation Plan (GSIP) to evaluate the degree of groundwater and surface water contamination from the site; and 5) Design and implement [Institutional Controls](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.redevelop&id=0100580#Limits) for the site which will restrict future land use. The purpose of the Institutional Controls is to preserve the effectiveness of the remedy, so that human health and the environment remains protected, and allow each property owner the fullest possible use of their property.

The PRPs began designing the cleanup remedies in 1989. Design of the site permeable and impermeable cap was finalized in 1992. Construction of the permeable and impermeable cap began in 1993. Currently, the impermeable cap, gas collection and treatment system, and the permeable cap are complete. [Cover certification reports](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0100580&doc=Y&colid=33188&region=01&type=SC), which document the proper installation of the protective caps, remain to be completed for all the properties on the Site. The design of the interim groundwater treatment system was completed initially in the fall of 1992; however, the system was altered to reflect changes resulting from a pilot air sparging design in 1993. The pilot air sparging system was designed and operational for a short period in the summer of 1994, when it was discovered that the system failed to meet the design standards and shut down. No other groundwater treatment has occurred at the Site. In the early 1990's, the PRPs conducted two phases of the GSIP. Between 1999 and 2004, the PRPs implemented an EPA approved comprehensive third/ Final GSIP investigation (see below). In 1995, EPA established a working group for the institutional controls consisting of state, landowner, and potentially responsible party representatives, and the group established a draft outline. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, EPA and the State coordinated with the PRPs over the institutional control design's consistency with the working group's outline, as well as the new Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP) Activity and Use Limitations (AULs) format. In August 2002, EPA and the State released the draft institutional controls design to the landowners and the PRPs, and provided a presentation in September 2002. In April 2005, EPA responded to the public comments received on the draft institutional controls design and released [Draft Grant of Environmental Restrictions & Easements (GERE) Design](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/236969) (institutional controls design) to the landowners and the PRPs. Through a modification to the MCP in 2014, the pace of inaugurating and recording institutional controls at the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds has increased through the use of Notices of Activity and Use Limitations (NAUL). In January 2018, EPA and the State prepared a model OU-1 NAUL.

As of September 30, 2008, the PRPs documented the completion of the soil, sediment and air portions of the Industri-plex Operable Unit 1 (OU1) remedial action through the preparation of a Master Cover Certification Report, as well as 34 property-specific [Cover Certification Reports](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0100580&doc=Y&colid=33188&region=01&type=SC) within Industri-plex OU1. EPA provided a copy of the [property-specific Cover Certification Reports](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0100580&doc=Y&colid=33188&region=01&type=SC) to each property owner. Additional copies are maintained at the Woburn Public Library and EPA's Record Center located at One Congress Street, Boston, MA. Electronic copies of these Cover Certification Reports are available [here,](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0100580&doc=Y&colid=33188&region=01&type=SC) where an interactive map and address table can be used to retrieve a property-specific report. Currently, EPA, State, and the PRPs are focused on the requirements for inaugurating and recording the NAULs on each property.

In 1990, the potentially responsible parties began the GSIP investigation into the nature and extent of the site-related groundwater, surface water and sediment contamination. The potentially responsible parties completed two investigations and prepared a GSIP Phase 1 and 2 Report. In the Fall of 1998, EPA completed negotiations with the potentially responsible parties for a more comprehensive investigation. The potentially responsible parties agreed to implement a comprehensive investigation, entitled the Final GSIP, which investigates the extent of site-related metals and organics contamination in groundwater, surface water, and sediments, and evaluates any environmental and human health risks posed by the contamination from Industri-Plex Site to Route 128. Between 1999 and 2004, the potential responsible parties (PRPs) completed Final GSIP sample collection and analysis. However, in June 2003, the PRPs declined to conduct the human health and ecological risk assessments under the Final GSIP. As a result, EPA prepared the baseline risk assessment, which was documented in Appendix 6 and 7 of the March 2005 Industri-Plex OU-2 (including Wells G&H OU-3) MSGRP Remedial Investigation, as described further below.

All the above "Site Stabilization" response action is associated with Industri-Plex Operable Unit 1 under the 1986 Record of Decision and 1989 Consent Decree, which are attached below under "Decision Documents" and "Settlement Documents" links.

**Groundwater Contamination (Operable Unit 2, OU-2)**  
Under the 1986 Record of Decision (ROD), EPA conducted a Multiple Source Groundwater Response Plan (MSGRP) which serves as a second operable unit (OU-2) for the Industri-Plex Superfund Site. The MSGRP investigated other potential contamination impacts on the area wide aquifer, and determined if additional remedies were necessary to clean up the aquifer within the Industri-Plex Study Area. The MSGRP incorporated the potentially responsible parties' GSIP data (described above), and served as a comprehensive Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) supporting a future ROD for the aquifer and any residual surface water and sediment contamination within the Industri-Plex Study Area. In 1997, the EPA prepared a Preliminary MSGRP Report based upon existing analytical data. In August 1998, EPA prepared a Historical Aerial Photographical Analysis of the Industri-Plex Study Area, illustrating property use and watershed changes since 1938. In 1999, EPA also evaluated the preliminary surface water and sediment data collected along the Aberjona River from Route 128 south (downstream) to the Mystic Lakes under the Wells G&H Operable Unit 3 (OU-3), Aberjona River Study Baseline Risk Assessment. The Wells G&H Superfund Site is located to the south of Route 128, immediately downstream of the Industri-Plex Study Area. The two Superfund sites are hydraulically connected by the Aberjona River, which begins in Reading, flows south through the Industri-Plex Site, under Route 128, through Wells G&H Site, and continues south eventually discharging into the Mystic Lakes. The Aberjona River Study (downstream of Route 128) data indicates the primary contaminants of concern in the surface water and sediments are metals, similar to contaminants found north of Route 128. Based upon this information, EPA decided to merge the Wells G&H OU-3, Aberjona River Study data, with the Industri-Plex OU-2 MSGRP data, and form one comprehensive RI/FS for the entire river system from the Industri-Plex Site to the Mystic Lakes (approximately 6 miles of river). In 2002, EPA completed a Historical Aerial Photographical Analysis of the Aberjona River Study Area from Salem Street, Woburn, to the Mystic Lakes. In September 2004, EPA completed the Wells G&H OU-3 Revised Aberjona River Study Baseline Risk Assessment, which identifies potential human health and ecological risks along Wells G&H 38 acre wetland (River Reach 1) and the former Cranberry Bog (portion of River Reach 2) immediately south of the Wells G&H Site due to potential exposures to sediments contaminated with metals (e.g. arsenic). See Wells G&H Site NPL Fact Sheet for additional information.

In March 2005, EPA completed the Industri-Plex OU-2 (including Wells G&H OU-3) MSGRP RI. This comprehensive RI describes the contamination and risks along the Halls Brook Holding Area (HBHA) and Aberjona River from Industri-Plex Site to the Mystic Lakes, and how contamination is migrating along the river system. The March 2005 RI merged and refined the baseline risk assessments from Industri-plex to the Mystic Lakes along the Aberjona River. The following summarizes the baseline risks presented to the public and environment: Arsenic and benzene (as well as ammonia) plumes beneath the Industri-Plex OU-1 Superfund Site boundary (groundwater) may cause future health risks to people who might come in contact with the water (future industrial/ commercial/ construction worker) within Reach 0; Arsenic and benzene (as well as ammonia) plumes from Industri-Plex OU-1 contribute to significant environmental risks in the HBHA Pond sediment and deep surface water within Reach 0; High concentrations of arsenic in both surface and deep soils in the Former Mishawum Lake Bed area may cause future health risk to people who come in contact with the soils within Reach 0; High concentrations of arsenic in shoreline sediments in three distinct areas along the Wells G&H Wetland and Cranberry Bog Conservation Area present a current and/or future health risk to people recreating along the shoreline (east side of the 38 acre Wells G&H wetland within Reach 1 near former production well H, west side of the 38 acre Wells G&H wetland within Reach 1 near the railroad tracks and Olympia Source Area Property, and west-central area of the Cranberry Bog Conservation Area within upper Reach 2); and High concentrations of arsenic in deeper interior wetland sediments presents a future risk to people who might come in contact with the sediments (future dredger/ construction worker) within Reach 0 and 1.

In June 2005, EPA prepared and released the Industri-Plex OU-2 (including Wells G&H OU-3) Feasibility Study, and Proposed Plan. Public comment period was held and extended from July 1, 2005 - August 31, 2005. In October, EPA prepared and released a Technical Memorandum - Evaluation of Ammonia and Supplemental Soil Data, a Fact Sheet Supplementing the June 2005 Proposed Plan, and re-opened the public comment period from October 20, 2005 to November 18, 2005. Copies of all the above documents are attached below under the "Reports and Studies" links.

On January 31, 2006, EPA prepared and released Industri-Plex OU-2 Record of Decision. The major components to the Industri-Plex OU-2 remedy include:

• Dredging and off-site disposal of contaminated sediments in the southern portion of the HBHA Pond; dredging and off-site disposal of contaminated near shore sediments at the Wells G&H Wetland and Cranberry Bog Conservation Area; and restoration of all disturbed areas. This component will address sediments posing unacceptable human health risks for near shore sediments and unacceptable ecological risks for the southern portion of HBHA Pond.

• Use of the northern portion of HBHA Pond as a sediment retention area (primary and secondary treatment cells) that will intercept contaminated groundwater plumes (including arsenic, benzene, ammonia, 1,2-dichloroethane, trichloroethene, naphthalene) from Industri-Plex OU-1, treat/sequester contaminants of concern (including arsenic, benzene, ammonia), and minimize downstream migration of contaminants (including arsenic, benzene, ammonia). The primary treatment cell will intercept the contaminated groundwater plumes discharging in the HBHA Pond. The effluent from northern portion of the HBHA Pond (secondary treatment cell outlet) will serve as the surface water compliance boundary, and achieve National Recommended Water Quality Criteria (NRWQC). Sediments which accumulate in the northern portion of the HBHA Pond will be periodically dredged and sent off-site for disposal. Portions of storm water from Halls Brook, which may interfere with the natural treatment processes occurring within the northern portion of the HBHA Pond, will be diverted to the southern portion of HBHA Pond.

• If necessary, In-situ Enhanced Bioremediation of contaminated groundwater plumes (e.g., benzene) at the West Hide Pile (WHP).

• Construction of an impermeable cap to line stream channels (e.g. New Boston Street Drainway), and to prevent the discharge of contaminated groundwater plumes, contamination of stream sediments, downstream migration of contaminants of concern, and potential impacts to other components of the selected remedy.

• Construction of a permeable cap to prevent contaminated soil erosion (e.g. Area A6), downstream migration of contaminants of concern, and potential impacts to other components of the selected remedy.

• Establishing institutional controls to restrict contact with soils, groundwater, or deeper interior wetland sediments with concentrations above cleanup standards and protect the remedy.

• Construction of compensatory wetlands for any loss of wetland functions and values associated with the selected remedy (e.g. northern portion of HBHA Pond, Halls Brook storm water by-pass, capped stream channels) nearby in the watershed.

• Long-term monitoring of the groundwater, surface water, and sediments, and periodic Five-year Reviews of the remedy.

All the above "Groundwater" response actions are associated with Industri-Plex Operable Unit 2 under the 2006 Record of Decision, which is attached below under "Decision Documents" links.

In September 2014, EPA prepared an Explanation of Significant Difference (ESD) relative to the 2006 ROD. The ESD created a benzene sediment cleanup action level, and required sediments in the Lower South Pond above the action level to be removed and disposed off-site, and all disturbed areas be restored. In June 2018, EPA prepared an ESD relative to the 1986 ROD. The ESD allowed residential land use at 120 Commerce Way, Woburn, MA (with conditions) and 200 Presidential Way, Woburn, MA.

**Enforcement Highlights**  
In 1979, in response to illegal filling of wetlands, the EPA obtained a court order to stop further development activities. The EPA and the State entered into a Consent Order with Stauffer Chemical in 1982, whereby Stauffer was to conduct an investigation and recommend cleanup actions. In 1989, the EPA and the potentially responsible parties signed a Consent Decree in which the parties agreed to implement the remedy (Industri-Plex OU-1 under the 1986 ROD) for stabilizing the site and to reimburse the EPA for past and future oversight costs. In 1998, EPA successfully negotiated with the PRPs to comply with the Consent Decree and implement the Final GSIP.  
  
In September 2006, EPA issued special notice letters to potentially responsible parties for the cleanup of Industri-Plex OU-2 (in accordance with the January 2006 ROD). On February 27, 2008, EPA and the US Department of Justice announced the Lodging of a proposed Consent Decree with Pharmacia, Inc. and Bayer CropScience, Inc. for them to design, construct, and maintain this remedy. On November 24, 2008, the U.S. District Court entered the Industri-Plex OU-2 Consent Decree.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Fencing and posting warning signs around the site have restricted access to the Industri-Plex site and made it safer while final cleanup activities continue. Upon completion of the final cleanup remedies, the soil and groundwater contamination levels at the Industri-Plex site will be reduced to meet established health and ecological standards.

In 2008, OU-1 cleanup construction was completed. OU-2 cleanup was implemented in three phases based upon the following approved remedial designs:

1) 2014 OU-2 100% Remedial Design for Lower South Pond (adjacent to West Hide Pile);

2) 2015 OU-2 100% Remedial Design Part 1 (HBHA Pond Remedy Structural Components including capping Area 6 north of HBHA Pond, and Dredging Restoration of Wells G&H and CBCA Wetlands, Draft Institutional Controls Plan); and

3) 2016 OU-2 100% Remedial Design Part 2 (HBHA Pond Remedy Non-Structural Components such as secondary treatment cell dredging, aeration zone and settling zone, and Mitigation of lost wetland functions and values).

In 2017, OU-2 cleanup construction was completed and documented in the September 2017 Close Out Report, including As-Built Record Drawings.

Redevelopment opportunities continue for various OU-1 and OU-2 properties at the Site in accordance with land use restrictions/institutional controls overseen by EPA/Commonwealth. As noted above in announcements and key topics, EPA prepared an OU-1 ESD in 2018 that permitted residential use on two properties at the site. One residential project (200-unit luxury residential) at 200 Presidential Way was completed in Fall 2019; while the other mixed use project (over 9,000 sf retail and 289-unit luxury residential) at 120 Commerce Way was completed in 2022. EPA approved a Work Plan by VHB for the New Boston Street Bridge Replacement Project, and construction began in 2022. EPA approved a Reuse Work Plan for 4 Megawatt Solar Generating Facility on the East-Central Hide Pile and East Hide Pile, and construction began in 2023.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site**.

This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.  
  
The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
