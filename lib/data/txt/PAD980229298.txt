### Background

The Occidental Chemical Corp./Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. Superfund site is located in Lower Pottsgrove Township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. From 1942 to 1985, four consecutive owners disposed of industrial wastes at the 250-acre area. Wastes included cutting oils, metal filings, tires and PVC sludge resins. Waste disposal practices contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. The Site was placed on the Superfund program's National Priorities List in 1989. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. The long-term remedy included groundwater recovery and treatment; operation and maintenance activities; performance monitoring; removal and off-site disposal of contaminated materials within the site’s earthen lagoons; removal and off-site disposal of contaminated soils and sediments from the site’s drainage swale and sediment pond; and institutional controls. Occidental completed the installation of the groundwater recovery and treatment system in January 1999. The excavation and transportation of contaminated lagoon sludges and soils began in June 2008 and finished in September 2008. Institutional Controls have been implented through a 2015 Environmental Covenant.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the Site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by Site decision documents. The most recent [2023 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2350783) concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2028.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Institutional controls are in placed to restrict groundwater use. Additional information about the institutional controls are available in the [2023 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2350783) (pages 10-11).  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. A 1984 removal action included excavation and off-site disposal of 898 tons of soil contaminated with trichloroethylene. In 1985, with state approval, the owner closed a 17-acre landfill, capping it with a rubber cover and two feet of soil. Another 7-acre landfill was capped in 1998. Lined lagoons built in 1974 were closed in 1995 under state oversight.
