### Background

The Byron Salvage Yard site in Ogle County, Illinois includes two areas – the Byron Salvage Yard (BSY) and the Dirk’s Farm Property (DFP). During the 1960s and 1970s, on-site facilities accepted drums of electroplating wastes and other materials (oil sludges, paint sludges, cutting wheels, solvents, and scrap metal). Industrial wastes were reportedly dumped directly on the ground and rainfall carried waste to be carried off site. Also, plating waste containing cyanide was sprayed on-site to control road dust. Since finishing cleanup, groundwater use restrictions remain in place and monitoring is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The original cleanup plan was detailed in a 1999 document called the [record of decision (97pp, 4MB,](http://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/142476.pdf) [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ). It included cleanup actions such as removing contaminated soils and drums, installing an alternate water supply for residents, and securing the salvage yard property with a fence. Groundwater monitoring systems were also installed, and testing occurs once every two years.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA completed a [five-year review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/984473) (36 pp, 6.59MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) in July 2023. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This type of review is required when conditions at the site do not allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure.

This was the sixth review which concluded the cleanup is protecting people and the environment.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site remedy also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups. In 1975, Initial cleanup activities at the DFP included removing drums and contaminated soils in the North Disposal Area, and treating cyanide-contaminated soils in the remaining three disposal areas. EPA fenced the site in 1984, while supplying bottled water to affected residents, and providing nearby homes with carbon absorption units to treat household water. In 1987, Illinois EPA finished disposing of 11,000 drums and 3,000 cubic yards of contaminated soils. The local public water supply system was also extended to nearby homes.
