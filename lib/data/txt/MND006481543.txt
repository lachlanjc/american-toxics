### Background

The 18-acre FMC Corp. (Fridley Plant) site is located in Anoka County, Minnesota. Operations on site generated and disposed of solvents, paint sludge and plating wastes in several locations from the 1940s to 1969. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Because of the threat posed to Minneapolis’ drinking water supplies, the site received one of the highest Hazard Ranking System (HRS) scores of all sites on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL). However, regular sampling of the water at the public drinking water intake has shown no exceedances of contaminants since the 1980s. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

EPA and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) have completed several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires evaluation of the groundwater extraction system, expanded groundwater monitoring, compliance with effective institutional controls, and completion of a new risk assessment with the potential for further cleanup requirements.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included a groundwater pump-and-treat system. Cleanup work began in the 1980s; groundwater monitoring began in 1987. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions around 1983 included soil excavation and containment.
