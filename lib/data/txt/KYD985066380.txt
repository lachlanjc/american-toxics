### Background

The 39-acre Newport Dump [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) Site is located in Wilder, Kentucky. The Site includes a grass-covered landfill and a drainage culvert, which traverses the Site from north to south. An industrial park borders the Site to the north. An unnamed stream borders the Site to the south. Steep outcrops border the Site to the east. The Licking River borders the Site to the west. The Site’s broader surroundings include industrial land uses.

From the late 1940s until 1979, the City of Newport disposed of residential and commercial waste at the Site. Landfill operations used trenching and area filling to dispose of wastes. In 1979, the city transferred ownership of the Site to the Northern Kentucky Port Authority (NKPA, now the Northern Kentucky Tri-County Economic Development Corporation).

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the Site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1983 because of contaminated groundwater, leachate, soil and surface water resulting from waste handling practices. Following completion of cleanup activities, the EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 1996. The Site is not in use. The Site can support industrial land uses.

The EPA, the [Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection (KDEP)](http://dep.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx) and the Site’s [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) have investigated the Site. By monitoring the Site, placing institutional controls on the Site property and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, the EPA, KDEP and the Site’s PRPs continue to protect people and the environment from Site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the Site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Site’s PRPs lead site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by the EPA and KDEP. The Site’s PRPs are investigating redevelopment options for the site and surrounding properties.

| When | What |
| --- | --- |
| **1980** | The Site’s PRPs installed a leachate collection system, regraded portions of the Site, constructed a cap and revegetated the Site. The Northern Kentucky Port Authority (NKPA, now the Northern Kentucky Tri-County Economic Development Corporation) also installed a permanent vegetative cover and began design of a groundwater monitoring system. |
| **1987** | The EPA issued a cleanup plan (a Record of Decision, or ROD) for the Site. The plan included:  - regrading the landfill surface - placing a cap over the landfill and revegetating the surface - repairing or replacing the existing leachate collection system - replacing the drainage culvert at the Site - monitoring underground gas migration, surface water and groundwater - placing institutional controls on the Site property.  The EPA and KDEP installed eight gas monitoring wells. |
| **1990 - 1992** | The EPA shut off the power to the leachate collection system and cleared an area on the along the river and trenched the area for installation of a sanitary sewer line |
| **1995** | The EPA updated the remedy in 1995 to document the installation of the new culvert and the decision not to restart the leachate collection system. |
| **1996** | The EPA took the Site off the NPL in 1996. |
| **2006** | The EPA installed two additional monitoring wells. |
| **2017** | The EPA completed the [sixth Five Year Review](http://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11070075.pdf). |
| **2022** | The EPA completed the [seventh Five Year Review](http://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11174362.pdf). |

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11174362.pdf) was published by the EPA HQs in 2022. The remedy at the Site currently protects human health and the environment because the landfill cap is well maintained and institutional controls are in place to restrict inappropriate uses.

The EPA updated the Community Involvement Plan in 2022.

Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. The Site’s PRPs are investigating redevelopment options for the Site and surrounding properties. The EPA plans to complete the next Five-Year Review in 2027.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Institutional controls are in place to restrict inappropriate uses.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, the EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the Site’s PRPs to investigate and clean up the Site. The PRPs continue to fund Site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
