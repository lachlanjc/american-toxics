Background
The 8.5-acre Aladdin Plating site is located in Scott Township, Pennsylvania. A small electroplating business operated on site from 1947 to 1982, when it closed following a fire. Facility activities included rinsing electroplated items in water, sulfuric acid, chromic acid and cyanide. Operators disposed of contaminated rinse water and sludge in two unlined lagoons at the site. These lagoons occasionally overflowed, contaminating soil and groundwater with chromium and other metals from electroplating process wastes. The cleanup of the contaminated soil is complete, and groundwater monitoring will continue. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2001. EPA continues to evaluate the site every five years to ensure protectiveness of human health and the environment. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
During cleanup, a site can be divided into a number of distinct areas depending on the complexity of the problems associated with the site. These areas called operable units (OU) may address geographic areas of a site, specific site problems, or areas where a specific action is required. At Aladdin Plating, there are two OU's, OU1 and OU2. At OU1, the goal was to address the principal threats at the site by removing the contaminated soils from the Aladdin property as a source of contamination and reducing the risks associated with exposure to the contaminated materials. OU1 remedial action completed in two phases between January 1990 and June 1992. Phase 1 addressed the area of soil contamination. While the Phase 1 cleanup activities were being conducted, soil sampling revealed that an additional area of contamination existed at the Site. This additional area of contamination was addressed during the Phase 2 cleanup activities. The completion of the Phase 1 remediation resulted in the cleanup of 13,635 cubic yards of contaminated soil. Phase 2 resulted in the cleanup of 16,147 cubic yards for a total of 29,782 cubic yards of soil being excavated, transported, stabilized, and disposed at two off-site regulated hazardous waste landfills. OU2 included the study of potential groundwater contamination. Liquid waste discharged by the electroplating facility caused contamination of a shallow water-bearing zone in the immediate area of the former plating building and surface impoundments. However, there was not a threat to human health or the environment from this contamination in its undisturbed condition. Although contained by shallow overburden and the naturally occurring topography, there was a concern that this contamination could migrate into aquifers used for drinking water supplies in the area if a disturbance occurred. Actions taken for OU2 included construction of an access road with a gate, rehabilitation of existing monitoring wells, and installation of four new monitoring wells. Also, instutional controls placed on the property to prevent disturbances of the shallow contaminated groundwater beneath the Site. Lastly, a notice of use restriction, in addtion to other enforcement documentation is with the property deed at the Lackawanna County Recorder of Deeds. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
The site’s long-term remedy included the excavation and off-site treatment and disposal of chromium-contaminated soils, backfilling excavated areas with clean soil, groundwater monitoring, and groundwater use restrictions. Construction of the remedy took place between 1989 and 1996. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing. Cleanup also included a removal action, or short-term cleanup, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. The removal action in 1987 included repacking on-site drums; cleaning and demolishing the on-site building; disposing of electroplating process chemicals, contaminated soil and site debris; fencing the site; drilling monitoring wells; and sampling soil. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. Twice in every five year cycle, EPA samples on-site and off-site wells to ensure protectiveness.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Institutional controls are in place at the site. Additional information about the institutional controls are available in the 2024 Five-Year Review (PDF)(Page 8). Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
As part of the five-year review process, EPA samples on-site and off-site wells twice in the five-year cycle to ensure protectiveness.
