Background
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) is in southwestern Ohio,  east of the city of Dayton, and encompasses approximately 8100 acres. The Base is divided into two administrative areas, Areas A and B. Area A covers 5700 acres and contains an active runway complex, warehouses, offices, industrial facilities, and flight line support. Area B consists of 2,400 acres and three old runways; it houses primarily research facilities. Areas A and B are separated by State Route 444 and railroad tracks. Environmental investigations at WPAFB are conducted under the Installation Restoration Program (IRP). The U.S. Department of Defense developed the IRP to identify, assess, and control potential environmental contamination that may have resulted from past operations and waste disposal practices. The IRP at WPAFB began in 1981, and consists of 65 sites or source areas (including 13 landfills, 12 earth-fill disposal zones, nine fuel or chemical spill sites, six coal storage piles, five fire-training areas, four chemical burial sites, two underground storage tanks and miscellaneous other sites).

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In 1988 the Air Force and Ohio EPA signed a Consent Order and a preliminary assessment of the site began.  In 1991 the Air Force and EPA signed a Federal Facilities Agreement for the site’s cleanup. The 68 individual source areas on the site were grouped into 11 geographical Operable Units (OUs) and one base-wide groundwater OU cleanup project. The cleanup Remedies for the site were included in six separate documents known as Records of Decision (RODs). In 1999 the construction of the remedies at the site were completed. The site’s long-term cleanup included landfill capping, leachate collection and treatment, gas collection and treatment, public water supply extensions, natural attenuation for a fuel spill area, institutional controls, and a “No Action” decision for some source sub-areas and off-source areas. Site cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. These cleanup efforts included removing  drums and tanks, installing free product recovery systems, and groundwater treatment. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
The site is being addressed through federal action. The Air Force has lead responsibility for the site, with regulatory support from EPA and Ohio EPA. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued enforcement of institutional controls through a Land Use Control Plan is required to maintain protectiveness in the future.
The Administrative Record documents for the site are available at the U.S. Air Force Civil Engineer CenterExit. Additional information regarding the WPAFB site and the Installation Restoration Program can be found at WPAFB  88th Air Base Wing Environmental Branch website.Exit

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Primary contaminants of concern are chlorinated volatile organic compounds and benzene compounds.
