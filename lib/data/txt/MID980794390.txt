### Background

The Charlevoix Municipal Well site is located in Charlevoix, Michigan. Operations at a public school as well as several industrial and commercial facilities may have contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Groundwater contamination impacted the public water supply. In 1985, EPA constructed a new water intake system and filtration plant, using water from Lake Michigan as its source. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1993. Currently, the City of Charlevoix obtains its public water supply from an intake structure in Lake Michigan, and municipal drinking water is not affected by groundwater contamination at the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In September 1981, the Michigan Department of Public Health found the city water supply contained contamination at levels higher than what EPA considers safe. Four monitoring wells were installed and confirmed rising levels of a chemical called trichloroethylene, or TCE, in the water. In December 1982, the city installed a temporary aeration system to remove some of the contaminants, which was only partially effective. Further groundwater monitoring revealed the presence of TCE- and PCE-contaminated water. However, PCE was not detected in the city’s water supply. TCE and PCE are in a class of chemicals called volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. VOCs evaporate readily and become vapor. TCE and PCE are commonly used as degreasers in industries and dry cleaners.

In June 1984, EPA decided on a cleanup plan to provide safe drinking water by constructing a new water intake system and filtration plant as the investigation continued. After completing an investigation of site contamination in September 1985, EPA decided on a second cleanup plan to monitor and restrict groundwater use. The new system allowed the contaminated groundwater to naturally move and disperse into Lake Michigan. The 1985 cleanup decision estimated the groundwater would return to a usable state after 50 years (in the year 2035).

At the time of cleanup plan selection in 1985, the full extent and some of the sources of the PCE contamination were unknown. In 1987, the state found additional PCE sources and has been managing these problem areas under the state cleanup program. Interim actions have reduced concentrations. However, PCE contamination remains in the source areas that may affect groundwater for an undetermined length of time.

EPA is the lead federal agency in partnership with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and local government agencies. The City of Charlevoix and the Northwest Michigan Community Health Agency are responsible for restricting the installation or use of private wells in the area.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review deferred a determination on whether the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The review concluded that the alternate water supply prevents people from ingesting contaminants in the groundwater. However, it also recommended further evaluation regarding both the potential risk of exposure to contaminants through vapor intrusion and whether groundwater will return to usable state within a reasonable period of time.

In 2016, EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began an environmental investigation of soil and groundwater contamination in Charlevoix to evaluate the extent of the contaminated area, pinpoint the sources of groundwater contamination, evaluate if there are risks to human health, and determine whether EPA needs do more cleanup at the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In April 2020, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued an Interim Record of Decision (ROD) to clean up groundwater, soil, and soil gas contamination and resolve vapor intrusion issues associated with the Charlevoix Municipal Well Superfund site. A total of six cleanup alternatives were developed and evaluated in accordance with EPA guidelines and considering public comments received.

The selected interim remedy in this ROD is Alternative 6: Soil Excavation, Groundwater Chemical Treatment, Air Sparging/Soil Vapor Extraction, Institutional Controls, and Vapor Mitigation:

- Removing soil contaminated above certain levels.
- Treating the contaminated groundwater in place, such as by injecting an oxygen-containing chemical into the water, which feeds natural bacteria in the water that breaks down the contamination.
- Using air sparging and soil vapor extraction to remove contamination in the soil and groundwater.
- Expanding deed restrictions limiting groundwater use, exposure to shallow contaminated soil, digging into contaminated soil in certain areas.
- Continuing the operation and maintenance of existing vapor mitigation systems used to remove contaminated vapors from structures and installing new systems at six properties.
- Monitoring groundwater.
- Municipal drinking water is *not* affected by groundwater contamination at the site.

Four structures located at the historical sources of contamination will be demolished to ensure a safe and thorough excavation of the heavily-contaminated soils underneath. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and EPA have already contacted the owners of those four properties. Property owners that have not been contacted by EPA or USACE will not be affected by demolition work.

On. Dec. 9, 2021, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency hosted a virtual public meeting to update Charlevoix residents on site activities that will take place in the next few months, including data collection, drilling, and installation of remedy components, among other activities.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
