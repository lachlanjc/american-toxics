### Background

The ten-acre Ritari Post & Pole site is in a rural area near Sebeka in Wadena County, Minnesota. A wood-preserving facility operated at the site from 1955 to 1991. The wood-preserving operation used creosote and pentachlorophenol (PCP) as preservatives. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) continues to oversee operation and maintenance of the site’s remedy.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) completed an investigation into the nature and extent of contamination at the site. In 1994, MPCA and EPA selected a remedy for contaminated soil and groundwater. The soil remedy included excavation and stockpiling of contaminated soils. For PCP-contaminated soils, the remedy required on-site bioremediation in a lined treatment cell. For dioxin-contaminated soil, the remedy required investigation of soil washing as a treatment technology and off-site incineration of remaining dioxin-contaminated soil. The soil remedy for both types of contaminated soil also included a contingency to require consolidation and disposal with a cap if treatment studies or actual treatment for three years indicated that soil cleanup standards would not be met.

In 1997, EPA and MPCA removed 38 deteriorating drums of PCP solution. This allowed MPCA to decontaminate and move or dismantle certain onsite buildings in preparation for further cleanup.

**Soil**

In 1999, MPCA and EPA modified the soil remedy in an Explanation of Significant Difference (ESD) to remove soil treatment and incineration from the remedy and invoke the contingency for on-site containment covered by a cap. In 2004 and again in 2007, MPCA conducted additional soil sampling to look for remaining contamination at the site. In 2008, MPCA and EPA modified the remedy for dioxin-contaminated soil to require excavation and off-site disposal. Therefore, the final soil remedy included an on-site disposal unit with a cap and excavation and off-site disposal of additional soils.

**Groundwater**

The 1994 groundwater remedy included installing an on-site water supply well and groundwater monitoring. The groundwater remedy also included a contingency to require extraction and treatment if groundwater contaminants exceeded certain levels at the eastern boundary of the site. In 1997, additional onsite and offsite monitoring wells and a deeper domestic well for the onsite household were also completed. In the 1999 ESD, MPCA and EPA determined that it would not be necessary to invoke the contingent remedy for groundwater and that groundwater monitoring would be sufficient. MPCA installed additional groundwater monitoring wells in 2010.

**Five-year reviews**

MPCA and EPA have conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review, conducted in 2018, concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term if the property is not used as a long-term residence. Long-term protectiveness requires development of a revised cleanup level for dioxin in soil, additional response actions to address dioxin-contaminated soil, and addressing several groundwater issues.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Operation and maintenance activities for the on-site disposal unit and groundwater monitoring are ongoing. EPA is making plans to conduct a new remedial investigation / feasibility study to recharacterize portions of the site where residual soil contamination may still be present. EPA will also investigate groundwater at the downgradient boundary of the site to determine if contamination above Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)\* has migrated off-site. A feasibility study will be conducted to evaluate potential alternatives to address the results of the remedial investigation.

\* Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) - EPA sets maximum safe levels of contaminants in the environment to ensure public health. The Safe Drinking Water Act sets the maximum contaminant levels of substances in public water systems.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The most recent five-year review has a summary of planned and/or implemented institutional controls.

### Sampling and Monitoring

A monitoring system comprised of 22 monitoring wells and an unused deep well remains in place. MPCA periodically samples the groundwater at the site for PCP and parameters to evaluate naturally occurring attenuation. During operation and maintenance (O&M), the monitoring wells are inspected and replaced as necessary. Monitoring wells have also been added for purposes of refining and expanding the monitoring network. The purpose of these monitoring wells is for evaluating degradation and changes within the groundwater plume and its boundaries.

MPCA has continued to monitor groundwater and found that, except for one location east of MW-20, the plume which exceeds MCLs is located on the Ritari property, which is covered by an effective institutional control. The results of ongoing groundwater monitoring of the site indicate that PCP concentrations exceeding the MCL of 1.0 μg/L are potentially migrating off-site to the east/northeast/southeast.
