### Background

The Battery Recycling Company Superfund Site (Site) is located on the coastal and alluvial deposits of the Río Grande de Arecibo floodplain, approximately 0.5 miles east of the Río Grande de Arecibo, and approximately 2.75 miles north of where the north-flowing river emerges from the mountains to the south. The floodplain and river continue for approximately 1.5 miles north of the Site before discharging to the Arecibo Bay of the Atlantic Ocean on Puerto Rico’s north coast. The Site includes property that was operated by The Battery Recycling Company, Inc. (BRC Property), located at Puerto Rico State Road No. 2 (PR-2), kilometer 72.2 Cambalache Ward, Puerto Rico. The BRC Property occupies approximately 16 acres.

The BRC Property is bounded on three sides (north, east, and south) by agricultural or undeveloped land, and on the west side by PR-2. A former cattle pasture a land crab habitat in the drainage pathways and canals that run toward the Caño Tiburones, and a residential neighborhood are located north of the BRC Property. A hardware store and concrete block business are located on the opposite side of PR-2 to the west.

The Battery Recycling Company (BRC) began its spent lead-acid battery recycling operations in 1994. Initially, BRC performed small scale spent lead-acid battery breaking and lead smelting, but between 2004-2005, operations increased and became a large-scale secondary smelter. Operations at the BRC Property ceased in 2014 and included, but were not limited to, breaking and sorting lead-acid batteries and refining the lead to be resold as lead blocks to battery manufacturers. Improper handling of the hazardous subtances and hazardous wastes by BRC led to high levels of lead contamination at the Site. In addition, workers carried lead dust on their clothes and personal equipment into their cars and homes. Consequently, in November 2010, April 2011, and May 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tested Company’s employees and relatives for blood lead levels. Some blood samples collected from the susceptible population (children below 7 years of age and pregnant and lactating women) exhibited lead levels above 10 micrograms per deciliter, which was the applicable CDC blood lead reference value at the time. Sampling of cars and residences of employees indicated lead levels above 40 micrograms per square foot (μg/ft2), with some vehicles measuring above 100,000 μg/ft2. In 2011 and 2012, EPA conducted removal assessments of residential properties and vehicles belonging to current and former BRC's employees.

Between January and April 2016, EPA collected soil (surface and subsurface) and stormwater samples from the Site to evaluate possible removal action, as well as to assess the Site for possible inclusion on the Superfund National Priorities List. Based on sampling results and information gathered during the course of the removal activities, on August 3, 2017, EPA listed the Site on its Superfund National Priorities List to address the releases of lead and potential releases of other hazardous substances at the Site.

Prior to 1994, the Facility was operated by Puerto Rico Chemical Co. (subsidiary of Hooker Chemical Corporation, currently known as Occidental Chemical Corporation) for the manufacture of organic chemicals such as fumaric and phthalic acid from the mid‐1960s until October 1979 when an explosion led to plant closure. Groundwater sampling found elevated groundwater concentrations on site of 1,1‐dichloroethene (DCE), trans‐ 1,2‐DCE, toluene, trichloroethene, and vinyl chloride. Groundwater contamination was also found off-site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Following the soil sampling events in 2008 and 2010, which resulted in the identification of elevated levels of lead at the Site, on June 7, 2011 EPA entered into a CERCLA Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (Settlement Agreement), Index Number-02-2011-2010, with BRC's owner and operator to conduct removal activities at the Site.

In 2011 and 2012, EPA conducted removal assessments of residential properties and vehicles belonging to current and former BRC employees. The first phase of the removal assessments in June 2011 resulted in removal actions at residential properties and vehicles containing lead contamination. The second phase included the reassessment of properties and vehicles that had previously been remediated and removal actions at those with elevated lead levels remaining. On September 9, 2014, due to BRC's failure to complete the removal activities required under the Settlement Agreement, EPA took over the removal action called for therein. The removal activities included, but were not limited to, removing lead contamination from the adjacent cattle pasture as well as instituting decontamination measures at the Facility to mitigate the migration of contamination from employees clothing.

In 2015, EPA conducted additional XRF screening of samples collected from the northeastern corner of the BRC Property and the BRC Property Drainage Ditch, which indicated the presence of lead in both areas, with concentrations generally greater than 800 mg/kg and as high as 88,800 mg/kg.

From 2016 until 2022, EPA continued to perfom time-critical removal actions to address soil contamination at the Site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 2019, EPA began implementing long-term remedial activities, Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS), to further assess site conditions and define the extent of the contamination caused by the past releases of hazardous substances from the Site and identify remedies, as needed. The Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study was completed in 2023. The results of the remedial investigation are described in Remedial Investigation Report 2023, while the remedial alternatives for soil and groundwater are described in the Feasibility Study. Both documents are included in the Administrative Record of the Site.

At the completion of the RI/FS, EPA prepared a Proposed Plan presenting remedial alternatives for soil as well as EPA’s preferred remedy soil and interim remedy for groundwater. The Proposed Plan and supporting documentation to address soil and groundwater contamination at the Site were released to the public for comment on August 15, 2023, and on August 29, 2023 a public meeting was held to discuss the finding of the RI/FS and the preferred remedy for soil and interim remedy for groundwater. The Proposed Plan comment period closed on October 16, 2023.

In March 2024, EPA announced the final plan to address arsenic and lead-contaminated soil, and volatile organic compounds in groundwater at the Site. The final plan, known as a Record of Decision, explains EPA’s intention to address remaining contaminated soil and groundwater on and off the site’s property.

The selected soil remedy consists of a combination of soil excavation, ex-situ treatment, and containment at an engineered disposal unit to be located at the Battery Recycling Company property. Meanwhile, the interim groundwater remedy consists of a monitoring program and implementation of Institutional Controls (ICs) in the form of governmental controls such as existing Puerto Rico laws or regulations that serve to restrict the usage of contaminated groundwater by restricting well installation until the aquifer is restored to drinking water quality standards. ICs in the form of informational devices will also be implemented, such as advisories or notices published in newspapers and periodic letters sent to local government authorities on the need to limit water withdrawal or new construction unless appropriate vapor intrusion investigations are conducted and/or mitigation measures are undertaken.

### Emergency Response and Removal

EPA completed Time Critical Removal Actions in 2022.
