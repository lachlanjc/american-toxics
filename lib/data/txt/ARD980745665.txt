### Background

The 38-acre Midland Products site is located near Ola, Arkansas. Old Midland Products operated from 1969 to 1979 as a wood-preserving treatment plant. A saw mill operated at the site as early as 1960. Wood-treating operations used creosote and pentachlorophenol (PCP). The company discharged contaminated effluent into waste lagoons, which occasionally overflowed. Following construction of the site’s remedy, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Old Midland Products operated a wood-preserving treatment plant on site from 1969 to 1979. However, aerial photographs indicate a saw mill may have been in operation as early as 1960. Former structures from past operations included several buildings used to house two saw mills, a wood-preserving treatment plant, raw material, waste storage lagoons and water treatment settling lagoons. Historical activities at the site include treating lumber with creosote and PCP. The company dried treated lumber in open areas to the east and west of the lagoon and treatment buildings. The company discharged effluent from the treatment process containing PCP and PAHs into waste lagoons. Waste lagoon overflows occurred, with drainage entering the intermittent stream west of the lagoons. In addition, operation of the lagoons resulted in contamination of shallow groundwater with an organic non-aqueous phase liquid and an associated dissolved organic liquid.Old Midland Products operated a wood-preserving treatment plant on site from 1969 to 1979.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included on-site thermal incineration of contaminated soils, sludge and sediments and extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater. Construction of the remedy finished in 1993. Groundwater treatment took place from 1994 to 1999 and from 2000 to 2006. EPA later updated the remedy to include a Technical Impracticability Waiver for the area of highest contaminant concentration in groundwater, monitored natural attenuation to address the dissolved groundwater contaminant plume, and institutional controls to prevent exposure to site groundwater. EPA installed additional monitoring wells in 2006 and has implemented the natural attenuation remedy. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

EPA completed the FY 2021 Five Year Review (FYR) for the Site. The FYR is a document that determines whether or not a Site is protective of human and environmental health. The results of the FY 2021 FYR indicate that the remedy completed to date is currently short-term protective of human health and the environment. Overall, the remedial actions performed appear to be functioning as designed, and the Site has been moderately well maintained.

EPA finalized the report on September 21, 2021. The document was uploaded to the Site webpage on September 22, 2021 and information will be sent to the local repository by September 30, 2021.

The Arkansas Department of Energy and the Environment performed groundwater monitoring sampling activities in April 2021 at the Old Midland Products Superfund Site. The FY 2021 First Semi-Annual Groundwater Monitoring Report for the Old Midland Products Superfund Site will be posted sometime during the Fall of 2021.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The ADEQ performs semi annual groundwater monitoring events at the Site. EPA will add EPA is in the process of scheduling a soil sampling event for dioxins sometime within the next month. EPA expects to get the results for this event between mid and late September 2020. EPA will post the sample results on the site webpage in the Fall of 2020.
