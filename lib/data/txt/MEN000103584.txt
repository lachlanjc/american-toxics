### Background

The 36-acre Leeds Metal site is located in Leeds, Maine. Operations at the site date back to the mid-to late 1800s. However, little is known about specific site activities before 1969, when the site property was leased to National Metal Converters, Inc. for use as a scrap metal recovery facility. Between 1969 and 1984, scrap metal recovery processes took place on site. Junk automobiles were brought by independent contractors and truckers from all over Maine to be shredded in a hammer mill via an electromagnetic crane and then pulverized into fist-sized pieces. Recovered ferrous metals were shipped off site for recycling via rail cars. Remaining material, known as auto fluff, containing non-ferrous metal, glass, plastic, fabric, foam, rubber and soil, was stockpiled on site. Gasoline and other fluids from junk cars were dumped directly onto the ground. At one point, as many as 100 drums were staged along the tree line in the southern part of the site. The Leeds Fire Department responded to numerous fires at the site; the auto fluff piles ignited and burned for hours, creating black clouds of smoke. The site is now inactive and unoccupied, and appears to have been abandoned since 1984. Following immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, site investigations and long-term cleanup planning are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. The Site has been fenced to keep people from encountering debris. Lead-contaminated soil from a former battery recycling area was removed under a short-term removal action.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA investigations in 2010 documented significant contamination on site, with impacts to nearby private drinking water supplies. The agency found a need for response actions to address imminent hazards posed by the uncontrolled wastes. After EPA sampling of nearby private drinking water supplies identified contaminants exceeding health-based benchmarks, the state installed carbon filtration devices at five homes with volatile organic compound (VOC) contamination. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection (ME DEP) continues to filter and monitor the wells at these five homes, and also monitors wells with trace levels of contaminants at an additional six homes.

An Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with Maine Central Railroad Company, the owner of the property, became effective on October 15, 2012. The Order required removal actions to limit access to on-site wastes, including installation of a security fence around the debris piles and former operations area, as well as removal of lead-contaminated soil in a former battery recycling area. Field activities began in late 2012 and continued through the fall of 2013.

Site-wide remedial investigations that include soil, surface water, sediment, the debris piles and groundwater were conducted between November 2015 and April 2017. Additional investigations to address data gaps were started in the summer of 2019 and are expected to be complete in spring 2020.
