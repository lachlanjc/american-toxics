### Background

The Wheeler Pit site, in Rock County, Wisconsin, is a 3.8-acre former disposal area within a 35-acre abandoned gravel pit. From 1960 to 1974, General Motors Corp. disposed of paint and wastewater sludge from its Janesville auto assembly plant as well as coal ash from power plant boilers at the site. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s cleanup. The most recent review concluded that the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment in the short term. Groundwater cleanup goals have been achieved. Long-term protectiveness requires ongoing operation and maintenance.

Long-term protectiveness also requires compliance with land and groundwater-use restrictions. Compliance with institutional controls will be accomplished by planning for long-term stewardship. EPA is working with the property owners　and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to update the site’s ICs.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has completed a five-year review of the Wheeler Pit Landfill Superfund site at County Trunk highways O and J in LaPrairie Township, Rock County, Wis. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This was the fifth five-year review of this site.

This review included an evaluation of background information, cleanup requirements, effectiveness of the cleanup, and maintenance and monitoring efforts. It also looked at ways to operate more efficiently.

EPA’s original cleanup of groundwater contaminated with arsenic, chromium, zinc, and barium consisted of a multilayer cap, a fence around the site, waste consolidation, long-term groundwater monitoring, institutional controls, and natural processes. Wheeler Pit was deleted from the Superfund list in 2004. The review concluded that the cleanup is protecting people and the enviroment. The next review is scheduled for 2022.

Other site-related information is available at the Hedberg Public Library and at the [Wheeler Pit Site Document and Data webpage](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.docdata&id=0505115).

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

All required Institutional Controls are in place and effective on the site property. ICs, which included deed restrictions limiting land and groundwater use, were recorded in 2014. The neighboring "Frank property" includes a 1995 Declaration of Restrictive Covenant. EPA also completed a Sitewide Ready for Anticipated Use Memo in 2016.
