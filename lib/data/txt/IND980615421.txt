### Background

The 7-acre MIDCO I site is located in Gary, Indiana. The fenced area includes a groundwater treatment plant, a contaminant source area and areas of contaminated sediment. Industrial wastes were stored, recycled and disposed of on site from 1973 to 1979. In December 1976, a fire destroyed an estimated 14,000 drums of chemical wastes. Operations resumed in October 1977. When the site was abandoned in 1979, thousands of drums of waste were left behind in addition to the fire-damaged drums. Facility operations contaminated soil, sediment, surface water and groundwater. Final phase of site cleanup is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed by a combination of federal,state actions and Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) actions under federal and state oversight.

The site’s long-term remedy includes the final cover and barrier wall, sediment cap, perimeter fencing, and use restrictions. The 2023 site inspection confirmed that these measures remain intact, undamaged, and effective.

In 2022, EPA made significant changes to the site’s cleanup remedy including using [monitored natural attenuation](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-04/documents/a_citizens_guide_to_monitored_natural_attenuation.pdf) (relying on natural processes to decrease contaminants) in place of the former pump-and-treat system to address the remaining groundwater contamination. These changes are documented in the [Record of Decision Amendment](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/977808) ).

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term.

There is no known risk to drinking water due to the Gary City Ordinance from 2006 that required all private well users to connect to Gary City water or draw water from the deeper confined aquifer.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions by EPA in 1981 and 1982 fenced the site, removed on-site wastes and the top foot of highly contaminated soil.
