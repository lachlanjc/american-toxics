### Background

The 9-acre Halby Chemical Co. Site is located in an industrial area of the Port of Wilmington in New Castle, Delaware. From 1948 to 1980, a chemical manufacturing plant operated on the southernmost 3 acres of the Site. Site operators discharged wastewater from the plant into an unlined lagoon. Wastewater containing chemicals then flowed through an adjacent tidal marsh, through the Lobdell Canal, and into the Christina River. These activities contaminated sediment, soil, surface water and groundwater. The Site was added to the National Priorities List in June 1986, making it eligible for investigation and cleanup under the federal Superfund program.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1995, EPA completed a short-term removal action, removing the buildings and above-ground storage tanks, leaving an empty warehouse. EPA also addressed 600 small containers, 13 pressurized cylinders, 200 drums, 50 tanks and about 1,000 small containers mixed in with shallow soil. All chemicals, which included carbon disulfide, thorium nitrate, mercury, ammonium thiocyanate, sulfide, cyanide and tetrachloroethene, in various containers were transported off-site for safe disposal.  
  
In 1995, EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order to Witco Corp., a former owner/operator, requiring that the company erect a security fence around the Site and treat the carbon disulfide soils in situ using a chemical oxidation process. The company successfully treated 11,000 cubic yards of soil by 1998.  
  
A Record of Decision was issued in March 1998 outlining the additional cleanup remedies, which included:

- capping soil;
- filling degraded wetlands;
- creating new wetlands at an off-site location to compensate for those lost; and
- institutional controls to prevent drinking water wells from being installed near the Site.

All construction activities at the ite were completed by 2002. Monitoring is ongoing to ensure the protectiveness of the cleanup remedies.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the Site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by Site decision documents. The most recent, [2022 Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2335643), concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short-term because there are no exposure pathways. However, for the remedy to be protective in the long-term, the following actions need to be taken: continue to monitor stormwater pond sediments to confirm a decreasing trend, and review the current resume groundwater monitoring. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2027.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls are in place to restrict groundwater use, disturbance of the soil and future use. Additional information about the institutional controls is available in the [2022 Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2335643) (pages 11-13).  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions between 1995 and 1998 included dismantling and off-site disposal of buildings and aboveground storage tanks; disposal of drum, tank and other container contents off-site; security fencing; constructing a berm to control the migration of contaminants from the on-site lagoon to the Christina River; defining the extent of carbon disulfide contamination; and soil treatment.
