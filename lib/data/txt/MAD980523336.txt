### Background

The 71-acre Haverhill Municipal Landfill site is located next to the Merrimack River in Haverhill, Massachusetts.

The Haverhill Landfill came into existence as of the result of the Great Merrimack River flood of 1936. The local businesses and residences were completely flooded and had no place to dispose of their damaged goods, food and other wastes from the flood damage. The city designated the site as the place to dispose of the wastes.

Municipal and industrial wastes were accepted at the landfill until May 1981. From 1982 until June 1996, sludge generated from the City of Haverhill’s wastewater treatment plant and paper beater waste from the Haverhill Paperboard Company were also disposed of at the landfill. In 1996, the city covered the landfill with an interim cover until a final site wide closure plan and long-term monitoring requirements could be finalized

Some of the wastes included 55-gallon steel drums of unknown materials, tannery and shoe wastes, tires and flammables such as lacquers, paints, oils and glues. The materials were either dumped on the surface of the site or deposited into shallow pits. Sludge and liquids were disposed of on a parcel of land near the river to the east.

The landfill is owned by Aggregate Industries and the City of Haverhill. These parties are responsible for groundwater, surface water and air quality sampling activities and final closure of the landfill. The parties also removed and properly disposed of buried 55-gallon drums of waste and capped the southern mound of the former landfill. Currently, the Parties are designing a cap for the northern mound, adjacent to the Merrimack River. Long-term cleanup and environmental monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state, municipal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. The former landfill is being closed out under the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) Soild Waste Requirements. Both MassDEP and U.S. EPA will continue to provide oversight for all site cleanup activities.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in two stages: initial actions and a long-term remedial phase focused on limiting unacceptable risks to humans and/or the environment.

Two phases of drum removals in 2004 and 2006 removed over 6,500 drums and 64 rolls of hazardous wastes and stained soils. The drums were removed and properly disposed of at an approved off-site disposal facility.

Grading and capping of the southern mound of the former landfill took place in 2012. The northern lobe of the landfill will also be capped once risk assessments and design plans are completed and approved.

The Haverhill Landfill is currently inactive and does not accept wastes.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

An Activity and Use Limiation will be required to prevent unacceptable expsosure to capped/covered wastes and groundwater.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Groundwater and methane gas essisions are monitored and sampled on a regular basis.
