### Background

The 4,600-acre McChord Air Force Base (Wash Rack/Treatment Area) site is an active military base located south of Tacoma, Washington. Past site operations included washing aircraft and the use of chemical solvents to remove oil, grease and other foreign materials from airplanes. Runoff from washing activities discharged into two unlined leach pits. Site activities contaminated groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1996. Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

The base provides airlift services for troops, cargo, equipment, passengers, and mail. Since 1940, almost 500,000 gallons of hazardous substances have been used and disposed of on the base. The Department of Defense Installation Restoration Program (IRP) was initiated at McChord AFB in March 1981. The purpose of the multi-phase program was to identify the locations and contents of past disposal sites and to eliminate the hazards to public health in an environmentally responsible manner.

In 1982, the Phase I record search investigation identified past and current potential waste disposal sites. Site 54, consisting of a waste spill and disposal area adjacent to the old paved wash rack and the industrial waste treatment system (buried leach pits), was identified at this time. The Phase II investigation in 1983 measured low-level organic contamination at several of these sites across McChord AFB and recommended further studies to confirm contaminant characteristics and distribution.

EPA designated Site 54 as the Wash rack/Treatment Area in 1984 and nominated it for inclusion on the National Priorities List (NPL) following Hazard Ranking System scoring. In 1987 the WTA was placed on the NPL. In 1989 the Air Force entered into a three-party Federal Facility Agreement (FFA). Under the terms of the FFA, EPA and Washington State Department of Ecology provided oversight of the remainder of the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) activities for the WTA. The Record of Decisions was signed in September 1992 and selected a cleanup approach using the passive removal of the fuel layer. After beginning this action, it was found that the volume of the fuel layer had been overestimated.

The original remedy was changed in 1994, to natural attenuation, whereby the contaminants naturally dissipate and degrade over time. Since 1994, benzene levels have remained below the action level indicated in the Record of Decision. The site was deleted from the NPL on September 26, 1996.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state and federal actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  

Groundwater cleanup goals have been met and no hazardous substances have been left in place. EPA completed the site’s final five-year review in 2004 and has since transferred regulatory authority at the site to the Washington State Department of Ecology.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1989, the U.S. Air Force signed a Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) with EPA and the State of Washington to address site contamination. The site’s long-term remedy included the natural attenuation of groundwater contaminants and groundwater monitoring. Remedy construction took place between 1993 and 1995. Following cleanup, state-led operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.  

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1996.
