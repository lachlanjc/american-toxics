### Background

The 250-acre Bonneville Power Administration Ross Complex (USDOE) site is located north of Vancouver, Washington. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) coordinates the distribution of hydroelectric power generated by the Federal Columbia Power System to regions throughout the Pacific Northwest. Improper storage and handling of materials and wastes on site contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1996.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions by BPA with oversight by EPA.

BPA and EPA have conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

The BPA has owned and operated the facility since 1939. Since its construction, the facility has provided research and testing areas, maintenance and construction operations, and waste storage and handling operations for BPA.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included excavation and off-site disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl ( [PCB](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=PCB) )-contaminated soils from the Capacitor Test Lab and the Ross Substation and Capacitor Yard; treatment of the contaminated soils at the Wood Pole Storage Area East with a gravel cap; capping the Fog Chamber Dump Trench Area 1; groundwater monitoring; and institutional controls. Remedy construction took place between 1994 and 1996. Quarterly site inspections are ongoing.

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1996.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions in 1991 included excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil from seven areas around the site.
