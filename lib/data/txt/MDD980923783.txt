### Background

The Kane & Lombard Street Drums Superfund Site consists of two former waste disposal areas located near the intersection of Kane and Lombard Streets in Baltimore, Maryland. The two former waste areas are also known as operable units (OU).

**OU-1** is a 9.7-acre parcel of the former waste disposal operations, including underlying shallow groundwater, on the southern side of Lombard Street near the intersection of Kane and Lombard Streets. The OU-1 remedy, which includes a multi-layer cap and subsurface slurry wall, was completed in 1991. The area, also referred to as a capped landfill, has been redeveloped into a golf driving range and parking lot.

**OU- 2** is a 40-acre parcel of former waste disposal operations located on the northern side of Kane and Lombard Streets, across from OU1. Several commercial and industrial businesses are located on this parcel. OU-2 includes a capped area of contaminated soil, and groundwater that has been impacted by the waste disposal operations at the site. Impacted groundwater extends approximately 6,300 feet to the southeast of the 40-acre parcel. The area surrounding the site consists of residential, commercial and industrial properties.

Between 1962 and 1984, the site was part of an open dump where demolition, municipal and industrial wastes were disposed. The site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List in June 1986.

The site lies along an industrial and commercial strip, adjacent to a high school and public recreation area. Residential developments and a large medical complex are located about a third of a mile from the site.

The groundwater beneath the site and in the vicinity is contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including trichloroethene, 1,2-dichloroethene and vinyl chloride, as a result of past waste disposal. The City of Baltimore supplies drinking water to area residents, and no residential wells are known to exist within a half-mile radius of the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1984, EPA completed the first phase of the OU-1 cleanup, removing drums and contaminated soils. Approximately 1,200 drums were removed, some containing flammable solids and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In 1987, EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) to address the remaining contamination at OU-1 by removing additional drums and contaminated soil, constructing a groundwater containment structure, and installing a multilayer cap. In 2003, EPA issued a ROD to address groundwater contamination for OU-2.

In 2011, EPA signed an Administrative Order on Consent with the potentially responsible party (PRP) to conduct an focused feasibility study (FSS) to further evaluate groundwater treatment options at the site.

EPA continues to work closely with the PRP on the FFS efforts. The results of the FFS, once complete, will be used to develop a Proposed Remedial Action Plan (PRAP) to further address contaminated groundwater at the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed through federal and PRP actions.

For OU-1, EPA removed thousands of drums containing hazardous substances, the construction of a groundwater containment structure or slurry wall, and the installation of a multilayer cap all help prevent direct exposure to contaminants at the site.  
  
For OU-2, the PRPs have installed a pump and treat system in a portion of the groundwater plume. A separate remedy for OU-2 will be selected to address contaminated groundwater for the entire plume, as well as any other actions to ensure protectiveness of human health and the environment.

An [Explanation of Significant Differences](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2229960) was issued in November 2018. This ESD modified the remedy selected in the OU-1 Record of Decision (ROD) to add institutional controls to protect the integrity of the remedy.

The [2020 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/03/2302580.pdf), is now available. The Five-Year Review concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2025.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The use of groundwater as a drinking water source is prohibited within the City of Baltimore.  

### Sampling and Monitoring

Sampling and monitoring at the site include:

- Groundwater sampling at the OU1 and OU2 wells
- Monthly site inspections of the OU1 cap to ensure remedy effectiveness
- Ongoing monitoring of the vapor intrusion mitigation systems that were installed in 2015 at OU2. These efforts ensure the systems are working properly.

### Enforcement Information

In 2011, EPA signed an administrative consent order with the potentially responsible parties to perform an focused feasibility study to evaluate a different cleanup strategy for the groundwater.
