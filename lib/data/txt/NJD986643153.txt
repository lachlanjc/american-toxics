### Background

The Zschiegner Refining Company (ZRC) site is located in Howell Township, New Jersey. The site is a 6.1-acre former metals refining facility.

The Zschiegner Refining Company operated from 1964 to 1992 as a precious metals recovery facility. On-site operations included the chemical stripping of precious metals from watchbands, film and electrical components. In October 1992, the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration raided the facility based on suspicions of illegal drug manufacturing. About 3,000 different chemicals (including peroxide, cyanide, caustics and acids) were found improperly stored throughout the site. Facility operations contaminated soil, sediments, groundwater and a building. During initial removal actions, about 2,000 gallons of acidic solutions, 1,600 gallons of basic solutions and 1,400 small containers of hazardous substances were transferred to acceptable containers and disposed of off-site. After immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, and site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in March 1988. The site was addressed in two stages: initial actions and a long-term remedial phase focused on source control and contamination pathways.

The remedial design was finalized in January 2007 and the on-site building was demolished and disposed of off-site in February 2007. Field work for the remedial action was initiated in June 2007 and completed in October 2008. Contaminated upland soil and contaminated wetland soil was excavated and disposed of during the remedial action. Wetland restoration monitoring was completed in 2016. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Initial Actions: EPA started a removal action in November 1992. Materials were segregated and transferred to acceptable containers, potentially explosive/reactive items were detonated, hazardous materials were removed off site for disposal, liquids in vats and drums were sampled, and on-site soil and sediment samples were taken. Phase II of the removal action started in March 1993; it involved the disposal of hazardous wastes secured during Phase I. Further sampling in 1995 identified inorganic contaminants in soil, surface water and sediment. In July 1998, EPA tested the private well water of nine residences downstream of the site for organic and inorganic compounds. Sampling did not find any contaminants at concentrations above state or federal health-based standards.

Long-term Cleanup: After a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the nature and extent of site contamination and to evaluate remedial alternatives, EPA selected a remedy in the site’s September 2004 Record of Decision, or ROD. The remedy called for excavation of contaminated surface and subsurface soil; excavation of contaminated sediment from the wetland and a small portion of the brook next to the site; transportation of contaminated soil and sediment off site for disposal, with treatment if necessary; demolition of the on-site building to allow for excavation of contaminated soil beneath it; and groundwater monitoring. Backfilling and restoration was selected for all excavated areas.

The remedial action is complete. The on-site building was demolished and disposed of off-site in February 2007. Fieldwork for the remedial action started in June 2007 and finished in October 2008. A total of 10,425 cubic yards of contaminated upland soil and 15,351 cubic yards of contaminated wetland soil was excavated and disposed of during the remedial action.

Long-term monitoring of groundwater is still ongoing.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Cleanup work at the site was completed in October 2008. All known soil and sediment contamination was excavated and disposed of at an approved offsite facility and affected areas were backfilled with clean fill and restored. Slightly elevated concentrations of site-related metals remained in the shallow groundwater on the former facility property itself post-construction, and these concentrations are declining naturally, as expected. Monitoring of groundwater restoration is being continued with reduced frequency to ensure the effectiveness of the remedy. There is no known exposure to the marginally elevated concentrations of contaminants that are still present in the groundwater.
