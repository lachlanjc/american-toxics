Background
The Arkansas City Dump Superfund site (Site) is located in Arkansas City, Cowley County, Kansas. The site consists of approximately 200 acres, with an area of approximately five acres that required treatment as a part of the OU1 remedy. The site is in the western portion of Arkansas City, Kansas, near the Arkansas River and Highway 166 (also known as Madison Street). From 1916 to 1931, the primary use of the site was as an oil refinery and cracking plant. The plant was largely destroyed by fire and explosion in 1925. From 1931 to 1981, the site was generally abandoned and the major site activity was the unregulated dumping of domestic and solid waste. The oil refinery operations at the site resulted in two principal waste types. However, only one of these waste types was subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA); the other was related to petroleum products which are specifically excluded from CERCLA authority. Between 500,000 and 1 million gallons of residual oil product from the refinery operation were present in the subsurface soils that contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These are not presently migrating through the soil and do not present a threat to public health or the environment. The refining operations generated acidic sludge wastes, which were buried on Site or abandoned at the ground surface. Some of the wastes were acidic enough to be classified as hazardous wastes under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) because of their low pH. Following cleanup, the site was deleted from the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1995. Operation & Maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The remedy selected by the EPA for OU-01 included neutralizing acidic sludge to render the sludge non-hazardous; neutralizing sludge to minimize or eliminate the release of sulfur dioxide gas; cover treated sludge to prevent any contact with neutralized sludge to prevent exposure in case of incomplete hazard neutralization; and establish institutional controls (IC) that prohibit actions that would disturb or impact the neutralized sludge in the future.  No action was selected in the 1989 Record of Decision (ROD) for OU-02. The site was addressed through federal and state actions. The EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The city of Arkansas City maintains mowing at the site. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
 This site was deleted from the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1995. The current operations and maintenance for this site consists of mowing and inspection of the waste area soil cover. The Sixth Five-Year Review was completed on June 15, 2022, and assessed the protectiveness of the current remedy for OU-01, as well as sitewide protectiveness. The remedy for Arkansas City Dump site and OU-01 are protective of human health and the environment. All exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks are being controlled. No issues or recommendations were identified in this Five-Year Review. The next Five-Year Review will be completed in June 2027. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
A Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions filed with the Cowley County Register of Deeds (City of Arkansas City, 1995), coupled with signage and regular state inspections, prohibit actions at the Arkansas City Dump that would impact the neutralized sludge or underlying groundwater, limiting unintended exposure to contaminants.

Sampling and Monitoring
Groundwater monitoring is not currently conducted because: • Unsaturated acid sludge waste has been treated to neutral from basic pH levels, as verified through confirmation sampling; • Groundwater and surface water exhibit ambient (neutral) pH levels, as verified through confirmation sampling; • Institutional controls restrict property use to prevent unacceptable exposure to groundwater contamination (e.g., use of groundwater for drinking water, construction of large structures); • The Five-Year-Review identified no changes to the site that would affect groundwater quality or use; • Non-CERCLA petroleum contamination is being managed by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) State Water Plan program as the Arkansas City Refinery daughter site; and • Sulfuric acid is not considered sufficiently volatile to pose a vapor intrusion concern (EPA, 2016).  Top of Page
