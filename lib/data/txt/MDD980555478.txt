### Background

The Chemical Metals Industries (CMI) Site is located on two non-contiguous parcels of land on Annapolis Road in the residential, commercial, and industrial mixed-use area of Westport in Baltimore, Maryland. At one of the properties, CMI operated a chemical manufacturing facility and recovered precious metals (“Site 2”). CMI used the other property, an inactive gas station, for storage of waste and scrap metal (“Site 1”). Site activities and leaking drums on both properties contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals, including elevated concentrations of metals and volatile organic compounds. Mass removal of impacted surficial shallow soils was performed under United States Environmental Protection Agency and Maryland Department of the Environment (“MDE”) oversight. MDE continues to provide direct regulatory oversight and monitor soil gas and groundwater concentrations of contaminants.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Site was addressed through federal and state actions.

In 1981, the EPA removed and disposed of damaged tanks and leaking containers and drums, in response to a request from the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) for technical and financial assistance. These vessels contained compounds that, when mixed together, could have produced lethal hydrogen cyanide vapor, endangering local residents. Following the Removal Action, Site 1 was capped and sodded, and a portion of Site 2 was paved for parking. MDE retained control of the site following the Removal Action, as well as the responsibility for groundwater monitoring.  
  
In May 1998, at the request of the state, EPA inspected the Site and found the asphalt cap at Site 2 deteriorating. Because contaminants could be exposed, the Removal Investigation concluded that the original Post-Removal Site Control was no longer effective for the Site. The EPA, in consultation with the State, conducted a removal of contaminated soils remaining under the deteriorating cap at Site 2 to eliminate or significantly reduce the threat posed to public health. This Site was proposed for the National Priorities List on October 23, 1981, but was removed on December 30, 1982, as a result of the EPA's initial Removal Action.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The CMI Site was not listed on the final National Priorities List. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), with support from EPA, addressed vapor intrusion at the site. Vapor intrusion occurs when volatile compounds vaporize and move upwards through soil, entering homes and businesses through openings in foundations and basements. MDE installed vapor intrusion mitigation systems in three adjacent homes and the MDE building on site. Additional environmental characterization work was coordinated between EPA and MDE, and included soil and ground water sampling and use of a Membrane Interface Probe (MIP) at the Site.

In consideration for EPA's use of Superfund monies to conduct the removal activities at Site 2, EPA and MDE mutually agreed to a State Memorandum of Agreement (SMOA). The SMOA stated that MDE would commence post-removal activities to ensure the effectiveness and integrity of the Removal Action once EPA's activities were completed. Under the SMOA, MDE acknowledged that the following post-removal Site control activities may be required:

1. provide for future operation and maintenance of the paved area at Site 2;
2. continue monitoring for residual contamination, if any, under the office building;
3. continue groundwater monitoring; and
4. assume responsibility for any and all future work necessary and appropriate at the Site.

The Site is now being monitored and maintained by MDE. Since the Site was not listed to the NPL, Five-Year Reviews are not performed by EPA.

### Emergency Response and Removal

In 1981, the EPA initiated a Removal Action at the CMI Site in response to a request from MDE for technical and financial assistance. MDE had discovered numerous chemicals in deteriorated and damaged tanks, containers and drums that were leaking their contents onto the ground. In addition, highly acidic and highly basic materials, which are incompatible, were improperly stored together. For example, drums labeled "cyanide" were stored adjacent to drums containing acidic materials. If mixed together, these compounds could potentially release lethal hydrogen cyanide vapor which would have endangered the health of the residents living in the vicinity of CMI. The initial Removal Action involved the removal and disposal of all surface materials that represented an imminent hazard. Following the Removal Action, Site 1 was capped and sodded for use as a playground, and Site 2 was paved with a 2.5 inch layer of asphalt for use as a parking lot. MDE retained control of the Site following the Removal Action, as well as the responsibility for groundwater monitoring. In May 1998, at the request of the state, EPA inspected the Site and found the asphalt cap at Site 2 deteriorating and cracking. Because contaminants could be exposed, the Removal Investigation concluded that the original Post-Removal Site Control was no longer effective for the Site. The EPA, in consultation with the State, conducted a Fund-financed removal of contaminated soils remaining under the deteriorating cap to eliminate or significantly reduce the threat posed to public health, welfare, and the environment by the contamination. In consideration for EPA's use of Superfund monies to conduct the removal activities at Site 2, EPA and MDE mutually agreed to a State Memorandum of Agreement (SMOA). The SMOA stated that MDE would commence post-removal activities to ensure the effectiveness and integrity of the Removal Action once EPA's activities were completed. Under the SMOA, MDE acknowledged that the following post-removal Site control activities may be required:

1\. Provide for future operation and maintenance of the paved area;

2\. Continue monitoring for residual contamination, if any, under the office building;

3\. Continue groundwater monitoring, and

4\. Assume responsibility for any and all future work necessary and appropriate at the Site. EPA completed the last Removal Action in November 1998. Site 2 is now being monitored and maintained by MDE which maintains an Emergency Response field office there.
