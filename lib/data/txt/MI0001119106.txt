### Background

The 17-acre Aircraft Components, Inc. (D&L Sales) site is located in Benton Harbor in Berrien County, Michigan. Several manufacturing facilities operated on site from the 1910s to the 1950s. The site began to be used for a variety of manufacturing purposes, including metal furniture manufacturing and printing, in 1914. By 1957, activities had expanded to include offices, storage, packing and shipping, electroplating, machining, forging and welding, lacquer spraying, spray painting, printing, type-setting, binding, color plating, and lithographing. Over the course of the industrial use of the property, fill materials were used to alter the existing riverbank and to build up former low-lying portions of the Site. Evidence of historical debris was present along the riverbank and on the floor of the river. In addition to these wastes, the northern portion of the Site along the base of the bluff has historically received wastes resulting from unrestricted dumping of refuse from Ridgeway Road. Although the dumping from Ridgeway Road is noteworthy, most of the materials were of a household nature (e.g., paint cans, used tires, and appliances) and are unlikely to represent a major source of contamination.

The other type of contamination at the Aircraft Components Site was radiological contamination. Radiological contamination at the Site was due to the use of on-Site structures for warehousing luminescent aircraft gauges. During storage of the gauges, and as the gauges deteriorated over time, radium-226 from the painted dials was released and dispersed throughout the buildings. Use of the Site as a warehouse for radium-painted gauges began in 1972 when a new Site owner, Aircraft Components Inc., transferred a number of surplus aircraft components from the Southwest Michigan Regional Airport in Benton Harbor, Michigan, to the Site. Aircraft Components Inc. was in the business of acquiring World War II-era aircraft components as military surplus from the U.S. Department of Defense and reselling them as part of a mail-order distribution service. Each radio-luminescent aircraft gauge was estimated to contain a radium activity of about 10 to 15 microcuries, which is about 100 times that allowed for a radio-luminescent timepiece containing radium.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed primarily as a federal, Fund-lead action with State of Michigan consultation. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Long-term protectiveness requires groundwater meeting site cleanup goals and compliance with land and groundwater use restrictions.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA divided the site into two discrete phases, or "operable units," or OUs, for the purpose of more easily managing the sitewide cleanup. The “radiation operable unit”, or OU1, addressed the cleanup of radium-226. The “chemical operable unit”, or OU2, addressed the cleanup of non-radioactive contaminants.

The site’s long-term remedy for residual radium-226 at the site included demolition of contaminated buildings and cleanup of radiologically affected soil. EPA selected a radium-226 cleanup level that would allow the site to be returned to the owner for unrestricted use from a radiation standpoint. Cleanup finished in April 2003.

The site’s long-term remedy for non-radioactive contaminants included excavation and off-site disposal of metals and/or pesticide-contaminated soil and river sediment. The plan for groundwater cleanup involved injecting a chemical compound into the contaminated area and allowing it to help decompose the contaminants. Cleanup levels will allow for the anticipated recreational or commercial/industrial use of the site in the future. To address this and other remaining groundwater contamination, groundwater injections took place in December 2007, February 2008, and January 2014. The migration of contaminated groundwater has stabilized and there is no unacceptable discharge to surface water. The boundaries of contaminated groundwater and soil gas have been delineated, and site-related contamination does not pose a risk to off-site businesses or residences. EPA is currently monitoring the groundwater and soil-gas at the site on a biannual basis.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

A Declaration of Restrictive Covvenant and Environmental Protection Easement was recorded on May 30, 2012. The Restrictive Covenant was placed on three parcels at the site restricting residential use. For two of the three parcels, residential use is allowed if a vapor barrier is installed, basements are prohibited, and soil below 12 inches is not penetrated. The Restrictive Covenant also prohibits the use of groundwater at the site until all cleanup standards are achieved.

### Sampling and Monitoring

EPA is currently monitoring the groundwater and soil-gas at the site on a biannual basis. Surface water is monitored on an annual basis. The migration of contaminated groundwater stabilized has and there is no unacceptable discharge to surface water. The boundaries of contaminated groundwater and soil gas have been delineated. Groundwater monitoring wells at the site boundary meet Federal and State drinking water standards and soil-gas monitoring probes at the boundary do not show site-related contamination. Site-related contamination does not pose a risk to off-site businesses or residences.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1995, EPA stabilized and secured parts of the site. A gate was installed at the entrance of the access road onto North Shore Drive on the west side of the site and several broken windows and doors were boarded up on several site buildings. Radiation warning signs were posted on the buildings and a radioactive ash pile was covered and fenced. Small amounts of waste material were containerized and staged in a secure area, pending later disposal. Removal and off-site disposal of radioactive airplane gauges and associated debris also took place from July 1997 to March 2000.
