### Background

The Strother Field Industrial Park site is between Winfield and Arkansas City in Cowley County, Kansas and covers approximately 2 square miles. Until 1946, the site was a military base. The site now consists of about 20 industrial and commercial businesses, as well as two inactive solid waste landfills. The landfills were used for the disposal of various industrial wastes. Groundwater at the site is contaminated with solvents. Until 1983, the Strother Field Commission operated a drinking water supply system that is still used for industrial processes. Two wells were installed upgradient of the contaminant plume in 1983, providing safe supply of drinking water. Approximately 2,300 people live within a three-mile radius of the site. Approximately 2,000 people work at the site. There are private and public wells located in the vicinity of the site, and some private wells are in the industrial park.

The site was farmland prior to 1940 when the cities of Arkansas City and Winfield purchased it to build a municipal airport. In 1942, additional land was purchased and leased to the federal government for use as a military air base. The Army constructed an airbase which it operated as a basic flight training school and fighter pilot facility from 1942 to 1945. Land use during this period was typical of a military air base, including aircraft maintenance and support activities, as well as barracks and related personnel facilities.

The Army returned the land, with improvements, to Arkansas City and Winfield in 1946; the site was then developed into an industrial park. Contamination at the site was associated with engine testing, drum storage, solvent tanks, solvent supply and discharge lines, paint treatment, and degreasing operations. These activities resulted in contamination of volatile organic compounds in the soil and groundwater at several locations within the site.

The site originally obtained water from a series of wells located along its eastern boundary. Following the discovery of VOCs in these wells in 1983, new wells were drilled on the western and northeastern boundaries of the site. Two of the contaminated water-supply wells were subsequently converted to recovery/remediation wells as part of an overall groundwater containment and treatment system. These wells are currently extracting groundwater for cleanup.

The site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in May 1986. A Remedial Investigation (RI) was conducted between March 1990 and July 1993.

The 1990 RI identified 12 potential source areas contributing to site contamination. The RI identified the primary route of exposure for future use as domestic use of water from existing or new water wells either at or downgradient of the site. Elevated concentrations of VOCs in soils were also identified as a principal threat to groundwater contamination.

The Record of Decision (ROD) selecting the remedy for the remediation of the site's groundwater and soils was issued by the EPA on March 1994. The EPA issued a Unilateral Order in September 1994 to complete the Remedial Design (RD) and Remedial Action (RA). The RD was approved in January 1998. As a result of studies completed during the RD, it was determined that there needed to be changes to the RA. An Explanation of Significant Differences document was signed in December of 1998. The first UAO was withdrawn because of the changes deemed necessary in the ESD, and a Consent Decree for the revised RA was filed in April 2004.

The ESD called for pumping and treatment at a lower rate with fewer wells, expanded groundwater monitoring, natural attenuation of the groundwater and a concrete cap at two areas where contaminants had been released.

The RA implementation for the groundwater (improvements to the system were started in January 2002 and completed in April 2004) continues to be monitored and maintained.

A workplan and schedule for the soil cap remedial work was submitted in May 2007. The EPA approved the plan in June 2007. Final design was completed and construction was started in December 2007. The soil cap work was completed with an inspection in April 2008.

The site is currently within the Post-Construction Completion phase of the Superfund Process and the fifth Five Year Review will begin in August 2025 (to be completed by Septermber 27, 2026).

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In August 1982, during a chemical survey, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) detected organic solvents in water supply wells at the site. In 1983, the KDHE attempted to verify these findings and learn more about the extent and potential sources of the various solvents used. The solvents included paint thinners and strippers, degreasers and cleaning compounds.

The KDHE oversaw many investigations and monitoring programs that identified the types of contaminants remaining in the groundwater and other areas and recommended a remedy for final site cleanup.

The site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in May 1986. The Record of Decision (ROD) selecting the remedy for the remediation of the site's groundwater and soils was issued by the EPA on March of 1994. A Unilateral Order (UAO) was issued by EPA in September of 1994 to complete the Remedial Design (RD) and Remedial Action (RA). The RD was approved in January of 1998. As a result of studies completed during the RD, it was determined that there needed to be changes to the Remedial Action. An Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) document was signed in December of 1998. The first UAO was withdrawn because of the changes deemed necessary in the ESD, and a Consent Decree for the revised Remedial Action was filed in April of 2004. The responsible parties (RPs) performing the work under the CD are Grief Brothers and General Electric.

The ESD called for pumping and treatment at a lower rate with fewer wells, expanded groundwater monitoring, natural attenuation of the groundwater, and a concrete cap at two areas where contaminants had been released.

The Remedial Action implementation for the groundwater (improvements to the system were started in January 2002 and completed in April 2004) continues to be monitored and maintained.

A workplan and schedule for the soil cap remedial work was submitted in May 2007. The EPA approved the plan in June 2007. Final design was completed and construction was started in December 2007. The soil cap work was completed with an inspection in April 2008.

A fourth Five-Year Review was completed in September 2021 and protectiveness was deferred until potential vapor intrusion pathways into surrounding buildings could be evaluated. The Responsible Parties have submitted a plan to conduct updated vapor intrusion work to evaluate remedy protectiveness.

The Fifth Five Year Review is scheduled to begin on August 27, 2025, and will be completed by Septermber 27, 2026.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and RP actions. Areas of volatile organic compound contamination have been capped and the on-going remedial action is cleaning up the contaminated groundwater. A fourth Five-Year Review was completed in September of 2021 and protectiveness was deferred until potential vapor intrusion pathways into surrounding buildings could be evaluated.

The respondents have submitted a work plan to conduct the vapor intrusion analysis. As of early 2025, the EPA is in the process of providing comments to the respondents on (1) the vapor intrusion work plan, and (2) a work plan for stream sampling. Submission, review, and approval of these work plans by EPA will allow the respondents to conduct the additional sampling work to determine whether the selected remedy is protective of human health and the environment. Additional work will be necessary if the current remedy is no longer protective. The sampling will also help inform the forthcoming Fifth Five Year Review. EPA anticipates sampling will begin during Spring 2025.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The institutional controls required in the Record of Decision and outlined in the 2001 Consent Decree have been successfully implemented at the site. The insitutional controls include land title covenants (deed restrictions) to prevent future use of contaminated groundwater for human consumption on those properties under which the groundwater is contaminated. These covenants prohibit the construction of new potable water supplies in areas that are or may be impacted by the groundwater contamination.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Groundwater compliance monitoring is completed on 16 well locations which are sampled semiannually at the site.

The respondents have submitted a work plan to conduct the vapor intrusion analysis. As of early 2025, the EPA is in the process of providing comments to the respondents on (1) the vapor intrusion work plan, and (2) a work plan for stream sampling. Submission, review, and approval of these work plans by the EPA will allow the respondents to conduct the additional sampling work to determine whether the selected remedy is protective of human health and the environment. Additional work will be necessary if the current remedy is no longer protective. The sampling will also help inform the forthcoming 5th Five Year Review. The EPA anticipates sampling will begin during Spring 2025.
