### Background

The Odessa Chromium #2 site is located in Ector County, Texas. Two chromium waste facilities operating during the 1960s and 1970s contaminated groundwater with hexavalent chromium. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2004.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal, state and local actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of OU-2’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that EPA expects the remedy to be protective of human health and the environment upon completion. Continued protectiveness of the remedy includes completion of the remedy at the north plume.

Woolley Tool and Manufacturing operations generated chromium wastes at a facility on 57th Street and Andrews Highway. A separate facility at 5329 Andrews Highway produced cooling water additives containing chromates from 1950 to 1965. Operations from 1965 to 1969 at that location generated cleaning vat solutions that also contained chromium. The two contaminated groundwater plumes at the site are associated with the two facilities. The estimated surface projection of groundwater plumes is more than 40 acres.Woolley Tool and Manufacturing operations generated chromium wastes at a facility on 57th Street and Andrews Highway.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA divided the site into two operable units (OUs) to prioritize and manage cleanup.

**Remedy Selected**

*OU-1:* This OU addressed development of an alternate water supply and cleanup of contaminated groundwater. The site’s long-term remedy included an extension of the existing municipal water supply system to affected residents.

*OU-2:* This OU addresses the north and south groundwater plumes. The long-term remedy included extraction and electrochemical treatment of contaminated groundwater. EPA later updated the remedy to an ion exchange treatment.

**Cleanup Progress**

*OU-1:* EPA provided about 3,500 residents with safe drinking water.

*OU-2:* Construction of the remedy finished in 1994. The groundwater treatment plant operated from 1993 to 2001. In 1999, an EPA contractor plugged and abandoned the perched zone wells where contaminant levels had met cleanup goals. One well has yet to meet remediation goals.  

After construction of the site’s remedy, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2004.
