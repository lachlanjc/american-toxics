### Background

Florence Land Recontouring Landfill Superfund Site is located on Cedar Lane, in the Townships of Florence, Mansfield and Springfield, in Burlington County, New Jersey. The landfill is located on a sixty-acre property. Twenty nine of the sixty acres contain the landfilled wastes including two small leachate collection lagoons. The property is bordered by farmland, the Assiscunk Creek, which is used for both recreation and irrigation, the Burlington County Resource Recovery Facilities Complex, and the Cedar Lane Extension.

Florence Land Recontouring, Inc., operated the landfill from 1973 to 1981. The fenced landfill is inactive, has been capped, and is covered by vegetation. Adjacent to most of the landfill perimeter are lands owned by Burlington County Resource Recovery Facilities Complex.

During its operation, the landfill was permitted to accept sanitary and industrial (non-chemical) waste. Due to a history of environmental concerns, including observed leachate seeps, potential groundwater contamination and emissions to the atmosphere, a Consent Order was issued by the New Jersey Superior Court in 1979 to employ adequate environmental controls. Compliance with the Order was sporadic.

Following the Consent Order, the Florence Land Recontouring, Inc. closed the landfill and terminated operations in 1981. In 1982, the waste fill area was capped with on-site clay-like material and revegetated. A leachate collection system was installed with the resulting leachate being placed into two lagoons and eventually disposed at an off-site wastewater treatment plant. Carbon adsorption filters were placed on top of the leachate collection system manholes to capture volatile organic compounds and control odors. In September 1984, the site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL).

In 1985/1986, a remedial investigation and feasibility study indicated that the main source of environmental concern at the site was the reported deposition of hazardous waste, including phthalates, heavy metals and volatile organic compounds.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The selection of a remedy for the site was documented in a Record of Decision on June 27, 1986. The objective of the remedy was to control the potential release of contaminants from the landfill. The major components of the remedy were: construction of a synthetic membrane and clay composite cap, a circumferential soil/bentonite slurry containment wall, an up-gradient groundwater interceptor system, a new storm water management system, a leachate management and treatment system with disposal at a Publicly Owned Treatment Works facility, a gas collection and treatment system, removal and disposal of lagoon liquids and sediments and other surface debris, construction of a perimeter fence, operation and maintenance of the constructed remedy, and long-term monitoring through sampling of groundwater, surface water, and sediments.

Leachate lagoon dewatering was completed in 1992. Dewatering of the leachate lagoons resulted in the removal of approximately 4,000 cubic yards of lagoon bottom sediments. The bottom sediments and other material were placed under the landfill cap, and the waste water was disposed of off-site. Following dewatering and removal, the lagoons were backfilled and graded.

Slurry wall construction was completed in November 1992. The slurry wall was installed to an average depth of 25 feet. Construction of the upgradient groundwater interceptor system was also competed in 1992. Groundwater was successfully diverted around the site to reduce leachate production. Construction of the leachate collection and treatment system was completed in March 1994 with leachate disposal at a publicly owned treatment works.

The construction of the twenty nine acre landfill cap was completed in February 1994. This work included placing subgrade material, stabilization of landfill side slopes and installation of a landfill gas venting system. The multilayered cap includes layers of fill material, grading layers, gas collection layers for the gas venting system, filter fabric, a clay layer, an impermeable membrane, a drainage layer, a fill layer, and a topsoil layer. During construction of the cap, areas of the site were regraded to provide for surface water management. Following cap construction, the site was revegetated.

Perimeter landfill fencing was installed in August 1994.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In March of 2004, EPA deleted the site from the National Priorities List.

The landfill is inactive and a 7.4 megawatt solar farm has been developed on the landfill. Operation and Maintenance activities include inspections and maintenance of landfill security fencing, the landfill cap, the upgradient groundwater collection system, and leachage collection system. Periodic environmental sampling is conducted to assess the effectiveness of these engineering controls. The most recent Five-Year Review Report provides an assessment of the remedy's protectiveness.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The remedy, as implemented at the site, continues to protect the public and the environment from exposure to contaminated materials in the short-term. In order for it to be protective in the long-term, certain actions need to be taken. These include the delineation and prevention of further extension of site-related contamination detected downgradient of the landfill.
