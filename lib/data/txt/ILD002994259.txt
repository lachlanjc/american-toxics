### Background

The Amoco Chemical Joliet Landfill site is located in Channahon Township in Will County, Illinois. The site consists of two inactive landfills that cover 26 acres, as well as an adjacent slough area. The site is located near an active chemical manufacturing facility owned by Amoco Chemical. Facility wastes placed in the landfills from 1958 to 1976 resulted in contaminated leachate and groundwater contamination. Contaminants of concern include volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and heavy metals. The landfills have been capped. The site’s groundwater remedy is under development.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. EPA’s next five-year review of the site’s landfill remedy is scheduled to be completed by September 2015.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Review of the site’s landfill cap by EPA in 2010 found the remedy will be protective of human health and the environment in the long term once groundwater cleanup goals are met. Leachate seeps also need to be addressed. The site’s groundwater remedy will also be selected and implemented by 2015.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The groundwater is contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that include benzene, toluene, and xylene. The leachate is contaminated with the heavy metals cadmium, copper, lead, and chromium. Coming into direct contact with contaminated groundwater may pose a potential health threat. The site is open to the river, making it possible for people and animals to come into direct contact with hazardous substances
