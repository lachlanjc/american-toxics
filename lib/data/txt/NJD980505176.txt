### Background

The Brick Township Landfill Superfund site is in Brick Township, New Jersey. The municipal landfill stopped its operations in 1979 after waste contaminated the groundwater with leachate.

The 42-acre landfill operated for more than 30 years, accepting sewage, septage, solids, bulk liquids, and other wastes. Chemical wastes were reportedly disposed at the landfill in 1971, although this was never fully documented. A private entity owned the landfill until 1973, before Brick Township bought and operated it until 1979, when it was closed.

Groundwater under the landfill spread contaminants to the southeast. To prevent further contamination of the groundwater, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) required Brick Township to install a landfill cap that was resistant to water. EPA also required the township to establish a long-term groundwater monitoring program.

With EPA and the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) oversight, the township completed the landfill cap in December 2013. The township continues to evaluate the cap regularly to ensure it is protecting the groundwater from contamination.

Drinking water for 58,000 people living within a three-mile radius of the site is not contaminated.

Currently, the township is leasing the landfill property to a solar energy producer.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA and Brick Township entered into an agreement called a Consent Decree in September 2009 where the township agreed to carry out the selected cleanup plan. Brick Township installed the cap in 2013 and located, isolated, and removed about 150 aboveground drums.

The cap has effectively removed the potential for exposure to contaminated materials on the landfill property. In addition, the landfill property is surrounded by a fence. New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Brick Township have established restrictions on the use of contaminated wells. Brick Township will continue to operate and maintain the cap and monitor the groundwater for the long-term.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Brick Township, with EPA oversight, addressed the contamination at the site in two stages: an immediate action and a long-term cleanup focused on the entire site.

The site is currently in the long-term cleanup phase. EPA completed the [second five-year review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/02/609916) in 2022 to evaluate the protectiveness of the cleanup.
