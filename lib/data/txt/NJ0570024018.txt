### Background

McGuire Air Force Base (MAFB) is an active facility that occupies more than 3,500 acres in a rural part of Burlington County, New Jersey. The base is bordered to the north by the community of Wrightstown, and to the east, south and west by the U.S. Army’s Fort Dix military installation. Past activities at MAFB in support of operational missions created a number of waste sources of potential environmental concern. Site investigations and long-term cleanup are ongoing. In 2005, the Department of Defense (DoD) recommended that McGuire (Air Force), Fort Dix (Army) and Naval Air Engineering Center-Lakehurst (Navy) realign to become one joint base installation. Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JB MDL) is uniquely capable of projecting air, land and sea power to support national defense.

MAFB originated in 1937 as an adjunct to the U.S. Army Training Center and Fort Dix and functioned under the control of the U.S. Army until 1948. At that time, jurisdiction over the facility transferred to the U.S. Air Force. Past activities at MAFB in support of operational missions created a number of waste sources of potential environmental concern. In 1982, the U.S. Air Force completed Phase I of the Installation Restoration Program (IRP) investigation “to identify, confirm/quantify, and remediate problems caused by past management of hazardous wastes” at the base. After additional investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in October 1999.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The first step to address the cleanup of the base was to sign an Interagency Agreement (IAG). This agreement was signed by the Air Force and EPA in September 2009. The IAG is a document that establishes the framework for performing the necessary steps and provides the responsibilities of all parties involved in the cleanup activities. In accordance with the IAG, the Air Force submitted a Site Management Plan (SMP) in December 2009. The site has been grouped into nine operable units (OUs). The SMP summarizes the status of the OUs and outlines the upcoming schedules for cleanup. The SMP is updated annually in June and submitted to EPA for review. In addition, the Air Force is participating in the Installation Restoration Program which is a specially funded program established by the Department of Defense (DoD) to identify, investigate, and control the migration of hazardous contaminants at military and other DoD facilities.

**Operable Unit 1 (OU-1** )  
LF 03: A 12.7-acre landfill operating from 1950 and possibly into the 1960s. It was used to dispose of miscellaneous industrial waste.  
ST-07: A 3-acre former storage yard. The area was contaminated mainly with PCB waste. A removal action was used to address this AOC.  
LF-04: A 2.5-acre landfill that operated for about two to three years beginning in 1956. General refuse and scrap material were buried in the landfill.  
Current Status of OU-1: The Air Force has completed the remedial investigation, feasibility study, proposed plan, Record of Decision, which was signed in August 2021 and the remedial design. The selected remedy includes optimized soil cover to augment the existing soil cover over the landfills and ensure that all buried waste has a minimum of two feet of soil cover, stabilization of the North Run Creek embankment, engineering and institutional land use controls, groundwater institutional controls in the form of a classification exception area /well restriction area, long-term monitoring of groundwater and surface water and periodic inspections. Construction is completed. Groundwater and surface water sampling is is underway.

**PFAS**

In 2016, the emerging contaminants, PFOS (Perfluorooctane Sulfonate) and/or PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) were confirmed to be present at JBMDL-McGuire. PFOA and PFOS are components of a type of fire-fighting foam that has been used since 1970 to extinguish petroleum fires. Private wells outside of the base boundary were sampled to identify the presence of these compounds. One well showed detection of PFOA/PFOS, but at a concentration less than the New Jersey Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL). JBMDL – McGuire has completed an initial phase of investigation to determine the extent of these compounds off-base. In 2023, JBMDL – McGuire has launched a second phase of investigation, extending further off-base.

The JBMDL – McGuire has also undertaken a Remedial Investigation (RI) for PFOS and PFOA at confirmed release sites within McGuire. Sampling of soils and groundwater were initiated in 2022 and continues to identify the on-site sources and the extent of PFOS/PFOA on base. Following completion of the RI, expected in 2025, JBMDL - McGuire will work with the EPA and NJDEP to identify the cleanup alternatives.  
  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The U.S. Air Force, EPA and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) meet on a regular basis to address the site’s cleanup. EPA and the Air Force signed an Interagency Agreement or Federal Facility Agreement (FFA) in September 2009. The site is participating in the Installation Restoration Program, a specially funded program established by DoD to identify, investigate and control the migration of hazardous contaminants at military and other DoD facilities. The FFA became effective on December 1, 2009.

The site’s Areas of Concern (AOCs) have been grouped into nine operable units or OUs. The Record of Decision for OU3 was signed September 30, 2019. The selected remedy includes a two-foot thick soil cap over the LF002 and LF020 former landfills, groundwater institutional controls (ICs), long term monitoring (LTM) of groundwater and surface water and PCB hot-spot removal outside the LF002 footprint. For WP021 (Waste Water Treatment Plan Disposal Area), the selected remedy includes PCB hot spot removal, LUCs, groundwater ICs and LTM of groundwater and surface water.

The Record of Decision for OU1 was signed on August 1, 2021.

The Record of Decision for OU4 was signed on April 29, 2022.

Each remaining OU is either in the process of completing a feasibility study, which evaluates possible alternatives for cleaning up of each OU, completing a proposed plan, which will go out to the public for review, in the process of completing a Record of Decision, which will document the selected remedy or in the process of completing a Remedial Design/Remedial Action.  

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

As stated above, each OU contains its own sitespecific issues and contaminants of concern. On a base- wide level, constituents include metals, volatiles organics, semi-volatiles organics, pesticides and PCBs. For more details regarding those contaminants of concern for each OU, one should review the remedial investigation reports which are available at the Administrative Record file online at http://ar.afcec-cloud.af.mil/ and at the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst local repository:

### Green Remediation

Operable Unit #1

207 tons dense graded aggregate pulled and stockpiled for reuse.

30 tons half stone (used for construction exit) stockpiled for reuse.

The Remedial Design for OU1 included the construction and removal of gravel construction roads, in order to complete the remedial action effort. The contractor for the future solar field construction requested stockpiling the gravel material for their future use. The gravel was certified as clean during the clean fill approval process and the gravel initially had been used outside of the contaminated soil areas. The reuse of this gravel was beneficial, as it reduced the need for Air Force contractors to acquire more material from local quarries, reduced the load on local landfills, and reduced emissions from the truck traffic required to dispose of this material and bring in similar material for the future construction effort.
