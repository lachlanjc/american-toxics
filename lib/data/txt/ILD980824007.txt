### Background

The Kerr-McGee (Reed-Keppler Park) site is one of four Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) sites in the West Chicago area contaminated with radioactive thorium wastes. The radioactive waste came from a nearby facility known as the Rare Earths Facility (REF). The REF, operated by Lindsay Light and Chemical Company and its successors from 1932 until 1973, produced non-radioactive elements known as rare earths and radioactive elements such as thorium, radium and uranium along with gas lantern mantles for private entities and federal atomic energy programs. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in February 2010.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Cleanup included excavation of 114,652 loose cubic yards of radioactively contaminated material from the site. Restoration work, which included backfilling, grading, reseeding, replacement of groundwater monitoring wells and roadwork, finished in November 2000. After follow-up investigations and a risk assessment, EPA determined that the cleanup had eliminated the health threats posed by the site and that no further cleanup actions were necessary. EPA selected a “No Further Action” remedy for the site in September 2002. Groundwater monitoring finished in 2007. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in February 2010.

Now that the site has been cleaned up to the point where there are no residual contaminants remaining on site that would prevent unrestricted use of the site property, no more five-year reviews of the remedy are required.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
