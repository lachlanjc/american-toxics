### Background

The American Thermostat Co. site is located in South Cairo, New York.

From 1954 to 1985, the American Thermostat Corporation built thermostats for small appliances at the eight-acre site in New York’s Catskill Creek Valley. The company was the only manufacturer in the vicinity, which is a popular tourist destination and a residential area. In 1981, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation discovered that American Thermostat employees were improperly disposing of chemicals at the facility. Workers had been pouring waste organic solvents down drains attached to an abandoned septic system for several years and dumping solvents and sludges on the parking lot.

State health personnel tested drinking water wells in the vicinity of the facility and found them to be contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE) and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including tetrachloroethylene (PCE).

Under state orders, the owners agreed to clean up the property and its surroundings; provide, monitor, and maintain carbon filtration systems for the affected private wells, and supply bottled water to the affected residents. When the company went out of business in 1985, it stopped providing bottled water and abandoned the maintenance of the carbon filtration systems at the affected homes. The State requested that the EPA sample other private wells near the site, provide bottled water and carbon filtration systems where necessary, and take over the maintenance of the water treatment systems at the originally-affected homes. In addition to performing the work requested by the State, the EPA also installed three air stripping systems at the facility. Air stripping involves pumping VOC-contaminated water into a pressurized vessel and then forcing a high pressure stream of air through the water, causing the pollutants to evaporate.

The EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in 1983.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1988, after completing a study to evaluate alternate water supplies, the [EPA selected a plan](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/99460.pdf) to provide clean water to residents near the site. The plan called for extending the existing Catskill water district pipeline to the affected and potentially affected areas. The EPA completed construction of the water pipeline in 1992.

As an interim measure while a source investigation was underway, the EPA installed extraction and reinjection wells and a soil vapor extraction (SVE) system at the site in 1989 to accelerate the treatment of the ground water. SVE removes contaminant vapors from below the ground surface for treatment above ground. Vapors are the gases that form when chemicals evaporate. SVE extracts vapors from the soil above the water table by applying a vacuum to pull the vapors out.

The EPA [selected a cleanup plan for the site](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/99885.pdf) in 1990, after performing an investigation to determine the nature and extent of the contamination at the site and to evaluate cleanup options. The EPA's cleanup plan included decontaminating the building located on the property, excavating, thermally treating, and replacing the contaminated soil, and extracting the contaminated ground water and using air stripping and carbon adsorption to treat it. Carbon adsorption is a treatment system that removes contaminants by forcing water through tanks containing carbon, which attracts and retains contaminants.

The EPA decontaminated the building in 1992. The soil cleanup was completed in 1996.

The ground water extraction and treatment system began operating in 1998. After operating the ground water management system for 10 years as a long-term response action, in 2008, New York State assumed responsibility for its operation and maintenance.

Soil vapor intrusion (SVI) is the migration of VOCs in vapor form from the subsurface into overlying or adjacent buildings. The EPA installed a cover over a sump and sealed cracks in the concrete slab foundation at a residence with a SVI issue.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Under Superfund, the EPA conducts reviews every five years to ensure that the implemented cleanups are functioning as intended and continue to protect people's health and the environment. The EPA issued five-year review reports for the American Thermostat site in September 2003, August 2008, December 2013, June 2019, and an addendum to the fourth five-year review in 2021. The EPA published the [fifth five-year review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/704670.pdf) in January 2024.

The 2024 five-year review concluded that the cleanup is protective in the short-term. The five-year review report also included a series of recommendations to make sure that cleanup actions are protective in the long-term. These recommendations include making sure the water supply system at Country Estates mobile home park is being properly maintained by the property owner; conducting a third-party evaluation of the Groundwater Extraction and Treatment System to determine how well it is capturing and containing the groundwater contamination plume (the area where contaminants are dispersed in groundwater); and reevaluating a home which had a SVI issue in the past, to see if any additional actions are needed to reduce the potential for exposure to contaminants.

In addition, because groundwater contaminant concentrations remain elevated after more than 25 years of extraction and treating it, the EPA believes that there may be residual sources of contamination on-site. The EPA is preparing a plan for a new investigation to look for that contamination and to evaluate how to address it. The EPA expects soil and groundwater sampling for this investigation to begin in August 2024.
