### Background

The 16.5-acre Hercules 009 Landfill [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in Brunswick, Georgia. From 1948 through 1980, Hercules, Inc. used 7 acres at the northern end of the site, known as the 009 Landfill, to dispose of waste. In March 1980, the [Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD)](https://epd.georgia.gov/) collected samples that revealed contamination on site. As a result, EPD canceled Hercules, Inc.’s permit to operate the landfill. Site operations ceased in 1982.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1984 because of contaminated groundwater, sludge and soil resulting from facility operations. EPA, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (Georgia EPD) and Hercules Inc., the site’s [potentially responsible party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), have investigated site conditions. By monitoring groundwater, maintaining the landfill cover and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, Georgia EPD and the site’s PRP continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. A water line connects nearby residences and businesses to the public water supply.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Hercules, Inc., the site’s PRP, led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and Georgia EPD.

**1990s**  
In 1991, EPA issued an interim cleanup plan to connect nearby residents and businesses to city water.

In 1992, parties installed a water line to connect residential properties and a church near the site to the public water supply. Additionally, parties discovered contamination in the yards of residences next to the site.

In 1993, EPA issued the long-term cleanup plan for the site. It included

- stabilizing contaminated surface soil, subsurface soil and sludge, and installing a cap over the landfill.
- monitoring groundwater, surface water and sediment in the on-site pond and the drainage ditch next to the site
- maintaining the landfill cap for at least 30 years
- placing institutional controls on the site property to restrict land and groundwater use.

Parties temporarily relocated residents while the PRP dug up contaminated soil and replaced it with clean soil. From 1994 to 1995, the PRP dug up contaminated soil on site and stockpiled it on site for treatment.

In 1998, EPA revised the cleanup plan to address the construction of the landfill cap and the treatment depth of contaminated subsurface soil and sludge.

Between 1998 and 1999, the PRP stabilized contaminated sludge and soil from the landfill and constructed a cap over the stabilized sludge and soil. The PRP placed fencing around the site property and additional fencing around the landfill cap area.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11166240.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2021. Because the remedial actions at all OUs are protective in the short term, the Site's remedy is protective of human health and the environment in the short term.

t Institutional controls have been place on the site property to restrict activities that could damage the landfill cap area as well as limit land and ground water use at the site. Monitoring of ground water and operation and maintenance of the landfill cap are ongoing

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The PRP placed fencing around the site property and additional fencing around the landfill cap area.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRP to investigate and clean up the site. The PRP continues to fund site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
