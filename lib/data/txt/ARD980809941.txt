### Background

The site is approximately a 40 acre plot of land that is located on Graham Road in Lonoke county near the Pulaski county line. The city of Jacksonville used the site as a sanitary landfill that served as an open burning and trenching operation from 1960 until 1973 when the site was denied a landfill permit due to high water table and poor drainage in the area. In addition to the municipal waste, drums of industrial waste from a local herbicide manufacturer, known as Vertac, were disposed of in the landfill. In 1986, the city fenced the site to prevent public access. In 1987, EPA added the site to the National Priorities List (NPL). Cleanup activities included removal of contaminated material, capping of on-site waste, water monitoring and maintenance. Land use controls keep residents from disturbing the cap or using site groundwater. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2000. The City continues to restrict access to the site and monitors the remedy.
