### Background

The 4.5-acre Arcanum Iron & Metal (AIM) site is located just outside Arcanum in Darke County, Ohio. A lead battery reprocessing facility operated on site from the early 1960s to 1982. During this time, battery casings were split to extract the lead cores for smelting. Battery acid drained into a low area on site. Reprocessing of the battery casings generated lead oxide sludge that collected on the ground surface. Some lead-contaminated materials were buried in on-site pits. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2001.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through PRP actions under state and federal oversight.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included soil and debris consolidation, and on-site treatment and off-site disposal of all contaminated soil and debris. Excavated areas were backfilled with clean soil. Results from groundwater monitoring indicated that groundwater was not contaminated. The site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) also fenced the site.

Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2001.
