### Background

The 171-acre North Hollywood [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is in Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee. The site is just south of the Wolf River at the North Hollywood Street bridge. The site includes a 70-acre landfill west and east of North Hollywood Street, a 35-acre abandoned dredge pond, a 13.5-acre area previously occupied by two former surface water impoundments, Oxbow Lake and Beaver Pond, and a forested buffer area. The Wolf River borders the site to the north and east; a quarry borders the site to the west; and single-family homes and apartment buildings, which include low-income and minority residents, border the site to the south.

From the 1930s to 1967, a municipal dump operated at the site. In the late 1940s, Hayden Chemical Company used the dump to dispose of wastes generated in the production of sodium hydrochloride. Velsicol Chemical Corporation acquired Hayden Chemical Company and continued disposal operations at the site. Other industrial plants in the Memphis area also used the site as a disposal area.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1983 because of contaminated groundwater, sediment, soil, solid waste and fish tissue resulting from waste disposal operations. EPA took the site off the NPL in 1997 after the site cleanup.

The EPA, the [Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC)](https://www.tn.gov/environment.html) and the North Hollywood Dump Steering Committee, the site’s [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), have investigated site conditions. By monitoring groundwater, surface water and fish tissue, implementing fishing restrictions on the former dredge pond area and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, TDEC and the site’s PRPs continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The North Hollywood Dump Steering Committee, the site’s PRP, led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and TDEC.

**1980-1981**  
EPA conducted short-term cleanup activities to remove some of the chemical wastes from the site. The City of Memphis installed chain-link fence around the site.

**1983–1985**  
The site’s PRP removed drums and capped and graded the landfill area.

**1990**  
EPA issued a cleanup plan (a Record of Decision, or ROD) for the site. The plan included:

- digging up, characterizing and capping drums and contaminated soil
- disposing of liquid wastes off site
- disposing of any drum contents exceeding acceptable on-site landfill contaminant levels at an off-site facility
- dredging sediment from the 40-acre dredge pond and placing the sediment beneath the landfill cap
- placing a landfill cap over the landfill area
- grading and revegetating the landfill cap area
- removing contaminated fish and restocking the former dredge pond area
- placing institutional controls on the site property to limit land use
- placing a fence around the site property

**1995–1996**  
The PRPs harvested over 26 tons of fish from Abandoned Dredge Pond (ADP), Beaver Pond and Oxbow Lake. They also dredged and capped contaminated sediment in place in the former dredge pond area.

**1997**  
Following the completion of the cleanup activities, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1997.

**2002-2003**  
PRPs harvested 31.5 tons of fish and installed additional fencing along the south, east and northeast sections of the ADP.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11155250) was published by EPA HQs in 2020. The remedy at the Site currently protects human health and the environment because contaminant source materials have been addressed through:

- excavations and placement of contaminated matenals in a capped former disposal area
- targeted dredging of contaminated sediments and placement of a soil cover over discrete areas of the ADP and former surface water impoundments; appropriately implemented Site O&M activities
- long-term monitoring data that indicate contaminant levels in groundwater, ADP sediment and ADP fish tissue have declined.

Long-term monitoring of groundwater, surface water and fish at the site is ongoing. The PRP regularly inspects and maintains fencing and no fishing signs around the abandoned dredge pond.

The site cleanup was completed between 1993 and 1996. Following the completion of the cleanup in 1996, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1997.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The site is zoned for agricultural or farm uses, but the lands are vacant and are currently not in use. A fence and warning signs are present on the site property. Fishing is prohibited.
