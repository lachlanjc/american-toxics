### Background

The 100-acre Sinclair Oil Refinery site is situated between the Genesee River and South Brooklyn Avenue, one-half mile south of downtown Wellsville, in Allegany County, New York. The northerly flowing Genesee River forms the eastern and southern boundaries of the site, South Brooklyn Avenue forms the western boundary, and an old refinery access road forms the northern boundary. The site consists of two areas: a 90-acre refinery area and a 10-acre landfill area.

After immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, EPA put the site’s long-term remedy in place. A site inspection by EPA, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) and Atlantic Richfield (ARCO), the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP), in June 2012 confirmed that all systems were operating as designed and are protective of human health and the environment. Environmental easements/restrictive covenants are in place on all the site properties.

The refinery was built in 1901 for the processing of Pennsylvania grade crude oil. The Sinclair Refining Company purchased the refinery in 1919 and operated it through 1958, when a fire halted operations. In 1969, the Sinclair Refining Company merged with ARCO. During the operating history of the refinery, the company manufactured products such as heavy oils and grease for lubrication applications, light oil for fuel, naphtha, gasoline, aniline, lighter fluid and paraffin. Wastes generated during the course of the refinery operations included tank sludges from a solvent plant, sludges from an oil separator, acids, pesticides, waste oil and heavy metals. While these wastes were primarily disposed of in the landfill located at the site, manufacturing and waste handling operations at the time also led to the contamination of the refinery surface soils, subsurface soils and groundwater.  
  
In 1981, debris from the Sinclair landfill was reported to have washed into the Genesee River due to erosion. Reports from the community and site inspections conducted by NYSDEC indicated that the site warranted proposal for the National Priorities List (NPL). In September 1983, the Sinclair Refinery site was placed on the NPL.  
  
In 1983, EPA and NYSDEC signed a cooperative agreement that identified NYSDEC as the lead agency responsible for overseeing the remedial cleanup activities at the site. In 1984, NYSDEC initiated a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) to determine the nature and extent of contamination at the site and evaluate alternatives for the long-term remediation of the landfill portion of the site. In 1985, EPA authorized an initial remedial measure at the site, consisting of the relocation of the surface water intake for the Village of Wellsville's public water supply. The intake was moved to a location one-quarter of a mile upstream from the site in order to eliminate the possibility of landfill wastes contaminating the Village's drinking water supply. In 1987, EPA took over lead agency status from NYSDEC.

For purposes of investigation and remediation, the Sinclair Refinery site is being addressed in two distinct operable units. OU1, which consists of the 10-acre landfill portion of the site, (formerly consisting of the Central Elevated Landfill Area (CELA), the South Landfill Area (SLA), and the area between the two landfills) and OU2, which consists of the 90-acre former refinery.

  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Immediate Actions: In 1983, ARCO removed about 10 drums from the Genesee River that had entered the river from flooding of the landfill. In 1983, the State of New York diverted the Genesee River away from the eroding face of the landfill and placed dredged material there as temporary protection against erosion. Later in 1983, the Village of Wellsville, Allegany County and the State of New York stabilized the berm constructed to divert the Genesee River to protect the eroding landfill. In 1988, the town's river water intake was relocated upstream from the landfill.

Stabilization of the Landfill: EPA selected the following remedies to stabilize the eroding landfill: (1) remove about 300 drums from the landfill and dispose of them off site; (2) excavate wastes from the 2-acre South Landfill Area; (3) place clean fill in the excavated area; (4) consolidate excavated wastes in the Central Elevated Landfill Area; (5) cap consolidated wastes in the Central Elevated Landfill Area; (6) partially channelize the Genesee River to protect the landfill from erosion or flooding; and (7) construct a fence around the entire landfill to secure it. Fieldwork started in 1990. Both of these activities finished in 1991. Construction of the landfill cap took place from 1992 to January 1994.  
Source Control/Refinery Site: EPA selected the following remedies to address the refinery portion of the site in a Record of Decision signed in 1991: (1) excavate surface soil "hot spots" that exceed health-based cleanup criteria and dispose of them in the Central Elevated Landfill Area; (2) pump contaminated groundwater and treat it to health-based levels before discharge; and (3) monitor site media, including the groundwater and surface water, for any possible contaminant migration. Excavation and consolidation of surface soils started in 1992 and finished in 1993. Phase 1 of the groundwater remedy – a combination of groundwater pumping and air sparging and soil vapor extraction for mass contaminant removal for the subsurface – operated from 1995 through early 2003.  
Although 160,000 pounds of contaminant mass was removed during Phase 1 operations, EPA determined that a Phase 2 groundwater remedy was necessary to address contamination of the groundwater aquifer as well as remaining areas of subsurface contamination, notably in the riverbank and riverbed of the Genesee River and in the main drainage swale. Elements of the Phase 2 approach include physical barriers to protect site contaminants from entering the river, the removal of contaminant hot spots from the riverbed and drainage swale, and pumping with discharge to a treatment wetland for on-site groundwater.

Construction of a groundwater collection and wetland treatment system finished in October 2008. This system has been operating since December 2008. Construction of the main drainage swale remedy took place during the summer and fall of 2009. In addition, EPA updated the site’s remedy in August 2009, identifying the need for additional soil and sediment removal from the riverbed, river bank and main drainage swale. These soils and sediments have been affected by LNAPLs, which are essentially oil sheens. Targeted soils and sediments were removed during the 2010 construction season and placed in the on-site landfill. Removal of these hot spots has mitigated the occurrence of oil sheens on the river and in the main drainage swale. Closure of the landfill and site restoration finished in 2012.

In June 2017, EPA completed its fifth Five-Year Review Report for the Sinclair Refinery site. Based upon its review of all relevant data, including the two Records of Decision (RODs) and Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD), investigation reports, design reports, progress monitoring and operation and maintenance reports, previous five-year review reports, and site inspection, EPA concluded that the actions taken at the Sinclair Refinery site currently protect human health and the environment. Long-term protectiveness is achieved upon the implementation of easements/covenants at the site properties, which have all been filed with the County Clerk effective October 2014.  
Other Actions: Three removal actions took place at the site between 1991 and 1995.

These actions included the demolition and removal of an asbestos-containing powerhouse building associated with former refinery operations. This effort included the demolition of a 245-foot concrete and brick smokestack and the excavation and removal of two underground storage tanks uncovered in the process of the powerhouse removal. Additionally, an oil-water separator was decommissioned and removed from the site and drums were removed from a building used as a storage facility by a previous site occupant.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

OU1: In 1985, the EPA issued a Record of Decision which established the consolidation and capping of two small landfills and partial channelization of the adjacent Genesee River as the remedy for OU1. OU1 construction began in 1990 for the partial river channelization project to prevent erosion of the landfill by the Genesee River. This work was completed upon EPA’s approval of the Remedial Action Report in 1992. The work to consolidate the two landfills at the southern end of the site was initiated in 1990 and was completed with EPA’s approval of the Remedial Action Report in 1992. The capping of the consolidated landfill began in 1992; this work was completed with EPA’s approval of the Remedial Action Report for landfill consolidation in 1994.

OU2: In 1991, the EPA issued a Record of Decision which established the excavation and disposal of surface soils exceeding the remedial cleanup criteria for arsenic and lead and the treatment of contaminated site groundwater. Surface soils excavation was initiated in 1992. Those soils that were excavated before the on-site landfill capping was completed were placed in the landfill; those soils excavated after the landfill had been capped were sent off-site to be landfilled. This work was completed in 1994 following EPA’s approval of the Remedial Action Report. Groundwater treatment has been addressed in two phases. Phase 1, accomplished primarily through air sparging and soil vapor extraction with limited pumping and treatment of contaminated groundwater, was initiated in 1995 and completed in 2003. Although approximately 160,000 pounds of subsurface source material contamination was removed from the site under Phase 1, data indicated that the groundwater aquifer beneath the site remained at levels above drinking water standards. Therefore, Phase 2 of the groundwater remediation became necessary. Phase 2 entailed site-wide pumping and treatment of the groundwater plumes. As the Phase 2 system was being designed and ready for implementation, the limited pumping and treatment of contaminated groundwater continued throughout the interim period between Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 2 began operating in 2008.

The Phase 2 groundwater remedy was designed to capture contaminated groundwater through a downgradient collection trench and then pumped to a constructed wetland treatment system. Treated groundwater is released to the on-site drainage swale in compliance with a discharge permit and eventually into the Genesee River. A need to prevent the migration of light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) directly into the Genesee River along the northern site boundary was identified and an action to drive sheet piling into the riverbank was undertaken. This was also accompanied by an action to remove LNAPL-impacted sediment from the riverbed. All of these actions were carried out by ARCO under EPA and NYSDEC oversight and were completed in 2011.

Post-construction restoration work, including the restoration of a recreation trail on the western bank of the river, finished in early 2012. The Phase 2 groundwater remedy is the final remedial action planned at the site. A site inspection by EPA, NYSDEC and ARCO in June 2012 confirmed that all systems were operating as designed and are protective of human health and the environment. Environmental easements/restrictive covenants have been placed on all site properties to ensure the integrity of the site remedy and prevent groundwater usage until the aquifer is restored. EPA continues to monitor the systems in place at the site to ensure their effectiveness in meeting site cleanup goals.

The last five-year review of the site was completed in 2022. The review concluded that the implemented remedies at the site were protective of human health and the environment. The next five-year review will be completed by 2027
