Background
The 43-acre Bay City Middlegrounds Landfill site is located on Middleground Island in Bay City, Michigan. Bay City operated the landfill from 1956 to 1984. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals.  Michigan Department of the Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) is the lead agency currently conducting operation and maintenance activities at the site.  Top of Page

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
