### Background

The Jacobs Smelter site is in the Rush Valley, Tooele County, Utah. This is near the town of Stockton and about five miles south of Tooele, Utah. The site covers about eight square miles and includes the town of Stockton.

In the 1860s and 1870s, there was smelting and mining activity on the site. This made heavy metal contaminated soil, mill tailings, and smelter waste. The waste is in several locations within the site boundaries. The primary contaminants are lead and arsenic.

Several areas of the site have been cleaned up. The EPA is still investigating and evaluating the remaining areas.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Utah Department of Environmental Quality has been the lead agency for most of the work done at the Jacobs Smelter Superfund site. The state works in partnership with the EPA to address unacceptable risk to human health and the environment at this site.

This site is one of many across the country to receive funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which invested $3.5 billion in environmental remediation at Superfund sites on the National Priorities List.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding was used to excavate approximately 80,000 tons of soil contaminated with lead and arsenic from both residential and recreational areas in the Waterman Smelter area of Operable Unit 2. The contaminated soil was disposed of off-site, backfilled with clean soil, and revegetated.

The EPA and the Utah Department of Environmental Quality will evaluate the success of this cleanup and revegetation in the Five-Year Review in 2025.

The initial cleanup of the site in 1999 included residential properties within the Town of Stockton. This part of the site was deleted from the National Priorities List. The Town of Stockton passed an ordinance to make sure that any contamination remaining below 18 inches is managed safely if it is excavated. The Town of Stockton has also made a dump to accept contaminated material excavated during building and construction activities.

The developer, the Utah Department of Environmental Quality and the EPA have done cleanups at properties in the Rawhide Ranchettes subdivision. These properties had contamination above action levels. The contaminated material removed during the developer’s work was placed within the roadbed or in a covered dump in the subdivision that remains deeded to the developer. The contaminated soil removed during the State’s and EPA’s 2010 work was taken to an off-site landfill.

Cleanup for the remaining areas contaminated with lead and arsenic in the Waterman Smelter began in August 2022 and was funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Cleanup will be evaluated in the upcoming Five-Year Review.

The Union Pacific Railroad has completed cleanup along the rail line in the town of Stockton. This area has also been deleted from the National Priorities List.

Under oversight by EPA and UDEQ, Kennecott Utah Copper LLC, now Rio Tinto Kennecott, finished a cleanup of land next to the Rawhide Ranchettes subdivision. An environmental covenant, which runs with the property, was recorded with the Tooele County recorder’s office. The environmental covenant outlines what must be done for the cleanup to remain protective if there is a land use change.

The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) finished a cleanup for the property they own near the historic Waterman Smelter.

In September 2020, EPA completed the fourth five-year review for this site. The reviews, conducted every five years, determine whether completed cleanups are still protecting of human health and the environment. The reviews also make sure that the cleanup plans have been followed.

This most recent review found that the remedies for parts of the site, OUs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are continuing to protect human health and the environment in the short term. However, several additional things need to be done to make sure the cleanups work in the long term.

At this time, the EPA cannot say if the cleanup in OU6 is protecting human health and the environment. The EPA needs to collect more data in the 2025 Five-Year Review.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Based on the January 2024 [Updated Lead Guidance](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/updated-soil-lead-guidance-cercla-sites-and-rcra-corrective-action-facilities), the EPA is evaluating the risks from lead in soils to sensitive populations. This analysis will include compiling available site data to determine the potential presence and extent of lead-contaminated soils. Lead can pose health risks to sensitive populations, especially children under 7 years old and pregnant or nursing women. The process to implement the Updated Lead Guidance will involve additional planning, data gathering, risk assessment and funding requests. The EPA will coordinate with our state partners and request public feedback on our proposed cleanup plans before additional cleanups begin.

While implementing the Updated Lead Guidance may take several years to complete, the EPA and Utah Department of Environmental Quality will share information on planned activities and results as they become available. In the meantime, and out of an abundance of caution, if you live near the Jacobs Superfund Site, the EPA recommends you have your children tested for lead annually; especially those under 7 and if the soil at your property was not replaced previously. Additionally, you can take some simple actions to limit exposure to potential lead contamination in soils, including:

- Maintaining yards and other soil cover;
- Washing hands, especially children’s, after handling soil, playing outside, and before meals;
- Making sure children eat nutritious meals high in iron and calcium;
- Keeping dust levels down by mopping and damp dusting regularly;
- Regularly changing out furnace filters;
- Keeping kids’ toys and play areas clean;
- Taking shoes off at the door and keeping pets clean;
- Wearing gloves while gardening; and
- Cleaning homegrown produce and peeling root vegetables.

The EPA Jacobs Superfund Site team will communicate with residents affected by this guidance about the specific next steps the Agency will take in their community. Residents may also contact the site’s Community Involvement Coordinator with questions or concerns at ( [haniewicz.missy@epa.gov](mailto:haniewicz.missy@epa.gov?subject=Jacobs%20Smelter%20site) ) or 720-415-4609.

The site consists of six areas, called operable units (OUs). Cleanup is complete at OU1, OU3 and OU4. OU5 is currently being evaluated to determine if further cleanup is necessary. The cleanup of the remaining areas of OU2 in the Waterman Smelter Area will be evaluated in the 2025 Five-Year Review.

**OU1**, residential properties in Stockton: Cleanup is finished and still protects human health the environment.

EPA did a cleanup called a time-critical removal action in March 1999. This cleaned up 29 of the most contaminated residential properties in the Town of Stockton. The EPA issued a plan called the Record of Decision for OU1 on July 29, 1999. In 2000, the Utah Department of Environmental Quality cleaned up an additional 126 residential properties as outlined in the plan.

Contaminated soil from individual properties, unpaved streets and sidewalks within Stockton were removed. The work addressed contamination above 500 parts per million lead on the surface and 800 ppm lead in the subsurface to a maximum of 18 inches below the ground surface. The excavated soil on each lot was replaced with backfill and topsoil. Sod, plants, trees, sprinkler systems and fences that were removed to perform the cleanup were then restored.

The Town of Stockton passed an ordinance covering excavation and development within the town in May of 2000. The ordinance requires permit applications for all construction work that requires excavation below 18 inches. This ensures excavated material is tested and handled according to appropriate state and federal regulations. In 2010, the Town of Stockton received a permit for, and built, a dump to accept contaminated material excavated during construction activities.

The residential properties cleaned up in OU1 were deleted from the National Priorities List in 2001.

**OU2**, soil contamination outside of the town of Stockton’s 1999 boundaries (from the Waterman Smelter operations): Cleanup will be evaluated in the 2025 Five-Year Review.

Remedial investigations for OU2 began in 1999. In 2001, EPA required the developer of the Rawhide Ranchettes subdivision to remove contaminated soils with lead concentrations above action levels from five undeveloped lots. The removal work was finished in 2001. Additional sampling in 2009 and 2010 resulted in follow-up removal work by the EPA in 2010-2011. This removed contaminated soil from four residences in the subdivision.

A proposed plan covering other areas in OU2 that have contamination above action levels was issued September 21, 2015. It addressed contamination on parts of several B&B Subdivision lots and the undeveloped land around the historic Waterman Smelter. A Record of Decision documenting the cleanup decision was issued in September 2016.

**OU3**, Stockton Rail Yard: Completed and still protects human health and the environment.

In 1999, the Union Pacific Railroad, under agreement with EPA, cleaned up contamination in OU3. They did this by placing a 16-inch soil cover over the contaminated soils in the railroad right-of-way through Stockton. OU3 was deleted from the National Priorities List on November 29, 2005.

**OU4**, parcel of land that lies between the Rawhide Ranchettes subdivision and OU3: The parcel is owned by Rio Tinto Kennecott Copper (formerly Kennecott Utah Copper LLC). It was cleaned up in July 2008 and still protects human health and the environment.

Kennecott Utah Copper did a cleanup under oversight of the State and the EPA in the fall of 2008.

Contaminated soil was removed except where the it was located underneath a large gravel hill near the railroad bed. This soil could not be accessed without impacting the railroad.

An environmental covenant addressing this contamination was established and recorded with the Tooele County recorder. The environmental covenant describes the additional sampling and cleanup work that is needed if the land use changes. OU4 might be proposed for deletion soon.

**OU5**, land owned by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and located northeast of Stockton and near the Waterman Smelter area: Cleanup partially completed.

In 2011, the BLM did a cleanup on the part of their property that is north of the Waterman Smelter area.

The EPA, BLM and the State are finalizing documentation that confirms that cleanup has been finished. It was found that the northeast parcel of BLM land was not contaminated from historical smelting activity. Instead, it is because of other sources.

As a result, the northeast parcel of OU5 will be removed from the Superfund Site boundary. The BLM will take over the cleanup of contamination on private property from the EPA. This will let BLM clean up the northeast parcel as well as neighboring sources that spread contamination onto the site.

**OU6**, contamination associated with the Chicago and Carson Buzzo Smelters south of the Town of Stockton: Future further investigation and potential cleanup is needed.

This area was originally part of OU2. It was separated from OU2 in 2014. The EPA established OU6 due to differences in land use and potential exposures. The area is mainly used for agricultural purposes and represents a different risk of contamination than other OUs of the site.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

There is an environmental covenant at OU4. This describes what additional sampling and cleanup work is needed on the contaminated material remaining at OU4. The covenant was placed on the property and has been recorded with the Tooele County recorder’s office.

The Town of Stockton Ordinance #2000-4 requires permit applications for all construction work that requires excavation below 18 inches. This makes sure that excavated material is tested and handled according to appropriate state and federal regulations.
