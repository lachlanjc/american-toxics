### Background

The Ellisville Superfund Site is located in St. Louis County, approximately 20 miles from downtown St. Louis, Missouri. The site is comprised of three non-contiguous operable units: the Bliss property (Operable Unit 2) (11.6 acres), the Callahan property (Operable Unit 3) (8 acres) and the Rosalie property (Operable Unit 1) (85 acres). The site was listed on the NPL on September 8, 1983.

The Rosalie property (OU1) is an 85-acre tract of land in which four acres were contaminated. The Rosalie (OU1) was discovered in 1980 when a sewer worker encountered buried drums during an excavation. Drummed liquid and solid wastes were disposed of in and near Caulks Creeks.

The Bliss property (OU2) is located at 149 Strecker Road in the city of Wildwood, Missouri. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MoDNR) began investigating the site in 1980, when an informant reported illegal dumping of hazardous waste at the property. Russell Bliss owned and operated the Bliss Waste Oil Company during the 1960s and 1970s at the site. The business engaged in the transportation and disposal of waste oil products, industrial wastes and chemical wastes. These wastes were disposed of in pits, buried in drums and liquid wastes were dumped on the surface of the ground.

The Callahan property (OU3), is located at 210 Strecker Road in the city of Wildwood, Missouri. In August 1980, the MoDNR received an eyewitness report that drums were being buried near a barn on the Callahan property. A follow up investigation revealed a disposal area of approximately 150 feet x 150 feet. During additional investigations, several drums were unearthed and sampled. Sample results determined that the drums contained paint-related wastes and solvents.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Rosalie (OU1) cleanup remedy included the excavation of drums from four locations and the removal of contaminated soil from two of these locations. The drums and contaminated soils were disposed of at an EPA approved hazardous waste facility. Over 200 drums including one and five-gallon buckets of chemical wastes were removed from the property. Of the 200 drums, only 45 contained suspected hazardous waste materials. Confirmation soil samples were collected to verify the effectiveness of the cleanup and the excavated areas were backfilled with clean soil and reseeded.

The Bliss (OU2) cleanup activities began February 6, 1996, and the permit for the incinerator at Times Beach was issued March 15, 1996, for the treatment of dioxin contaminated waste. Dioxin contaminated soil was removed according to the approved health-based action levels of 1 ppb at the surface and 10 ppb at a depth of 12 inches, except fill areas where the action level was 1 ppb at all depths. In the creek, the dioxin action levels were 1 ppb to 2 feet; depths greater than 2 feet were cleaned up to 10 ppb. Air monitoring and temporary containment structures were erected to ensure and prevent airborne contaminants from migrating off-site. At the end of the cleanup on the Bliss Property, 480 drums were removed and 252 soil confirmation samples were collected. A total of 24,478 tons of dioxin contaminated soil were excavated, removed and incinerated at the Times Beach incinerator. Another 581 tons of non-dioxin contaminated soil were also excavated and removed to either LWD, Inc. landfill or Rollins Environmental Services landfill, both Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) permitted landfills. The EPA conducted an additional Superfund removal action at the Bliss (OU2), an action which began in March 2014 and was completed in March 2015. The action successfully removed residual dioxin contamination in several areas of the site, and included environmental use controls for a portion of the site that were developed in coordination with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.

The Callahan (OU3) cleanup activities were initiated when the MoDNR requested assistance from the EPA to address the buried drums, and a removal action was immediately initiated. Under Section 104 of CERCLA, the remedial action took place during December 1981 to February 1982, when 1,205 drums were removed from the disposal area. Of these 1,205 drums, 613 contained hazardous waste, which were over-packed and staged in two areas on the site for off-site disposal. Approximately 500 cubic yards of excavated soil were returned to the excavated drum burial area as backfill (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2005). Another removal action was conducted during November 27, 2012, through December 6, 2012. A total of 2,056.74 tons of contaminated soil and debris, including drum fragments and metal pieces, were excavated and transported to the Milam Landfill for proper disposal as non-hazardous “special waste.” The final excavated area was approximately 21 feet long on the south wall, 75 feet on the east wall, 70 feet on the north wall, and 82 feet on the west wall. The depth of the excavated area ranged from 5 to 15 feet. Following completion of the soil excavation, the excavation was backfilled, and the site restored. Following excavation activities, the subsite was deleted from the NPL on July 17, 2017.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

New groundwater monitoring wells were installed at OU02 in August and September of 2022 along with semi-annual groundwater sampling continuing until 2027. The newly acquired data will be used to revise the revised risk assessment in 2026 for OU02.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Groundwater investigation and monitoring at the Bliss (OU2) are ongoing.
