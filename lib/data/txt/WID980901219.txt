### Background

The 27-acre Stoughton City Landfill is located in Dane County, Wisconsin. The city of Stoughton operated the landfill between 1952 and 1969. The landfill was used for the disposal of commercial and municipal wastes. Uniroyal, Inc., a plastics and rubber products manufacturer, disposed of solvents, other liquid chemicals and vinyl plastic scrap. Facility operations contaminated groundwater with hazardous chemicals.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was cleaned up in 1998 and included capping of the waste disposal area, excavation of some waste on the edges of the disposal area and placed under a cap, fencing, land-use restrictions, and long-term monitoring.

All deed restrictions are in place and remain effective.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources completed a [five-year review of the Stoughton City Landfill in 2018 (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/940495.pdf) (168pp, 7.02MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ). The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This was the fourth review of the site.

This review included an evaluation of background information, cleanup requirements, effectiveness of the cleanup, and maintenance and monitoring efforts. It also looked at ways to operate more efficiently.

The review found the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. The next scheduled review will be in 2023.

More information is available at the Stoughton Public Library, 304 S. Fourth St., and on this web page under Site Documents & Data.

### Sampling and Monitoring

O peration and maintenance and monitoring have been ongoing since the site was cleaned up in 1998. Long-term protectiveness requires ongoing monitoring of groundwater and gas migration, with appropriate actions taken as needed.
