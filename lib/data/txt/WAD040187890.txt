### Background

The 1-acre Yakima Plating Company is in Yakima, Washington. From the early 1960s until 1990, the company electroplated bumpers for cars and other objects and discharged wastewaters from its operations to an on-site drain field. These wastes contained a variety of metals, including nickel, cadmium and chromium. Site operations left heavy metal contamination in groundwater and subsurface soils. EPA added the site to the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1989. In 1991, EPA funded and conducted an early action removal and disposed of contaminated soil. Following construction of the site’s remedy, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing. EPA took the site off the NPL in 1994. An automobile painting and body works facility currently operates on site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

Since 1962, the company has electroplated bumpers for cars and other objects. Yakima Plating discharged wastewaters from its operations to an on-site drainfield from the beginning of plant operations. The plant operated under a state permit to discharge its wastewater from 1966 to 1977. In 1986, EPA found contaminants in the groundwater. The site is in a neighborhood of Yakima that includes light commercial and residential areas.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included removing liquids and sludges from tanks and containers for off-site treatment and disposal at a permitted hazardous waste facility; decontaminating underground tanks and abandoning them in place; and digging up contaminated soils for off-site disposal at a permitted hazardous waste landfill. In addition, the cleanup included institutional controls to minimize potential exposure to contaminated soils remaining beneath the Yakima Plating building and long-term groundwater monitoring.

**Cleanup Progress**

Construction of the site’s remedy took place between June and September 1992. The cleanup was addressed as a pilot project under EPA’s Superfund Accelerated Cleanup Model. In September 1992, EPA revised the cleanup plan to include a higher volume of soils to be excavated, building demolition and additional institutional controls. In April 1994, EPA revised the cleanup plan again to reduce the need for long-term groundwater monitoring from eight quarters to five quarters.

In 1994, EPA and the Washington Department of Ecology determined that the site’s remedy is protective of public health and the environment. No further remedial action or institutional controls are needed at the site. Accordingly, EPA determined that Five-Year Reviews were not necessary for the site and took the site off the NPL.
