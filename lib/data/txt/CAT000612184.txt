### Background

The Intel Corp. (Santa Clara 3) site is located in Santa Clara, California. Intel performed quality control of chemicals and tested microprocessors at this 4-acre area. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were used at the site and released to the shallow groundwater. After successful efforts to clean up the contamination, the site groundwater now meets state and federal drinking water standards.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA has been the lead agency for the site since 2006, with assistance from the Regional Water Quality Control Board.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review, written in 2016, concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. Groundwater contamination has been reduced to below drinking water standards and there are no restrictions on how the property can be used in the future.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The contamination at the property has been addressed and on September 24, 2019, the site was deleted from EPA’s National Priorities List of contaminated sites.
