### Background

The 26.6-acre Dixie Oil Processors, Inc. (DOP) site is located in Harris County, Texas, about 20 miles southeast of Houston, Texas. The site includes areas north and south of Dixie Farm Road. The property north of Dixie Farm Road is referred to as “DOP north.” The property south of Dixie Farm Road is referred to as “DOP south.” A copper recovery and hydrocarbon washing facility operated on the DOP north property. Past uses on the DOP south property included hydrocarbon washing to produce various chemicals, oil recovery and blending, and distillation of residues from local chemical plants and refineries to produce petroleum products. Site activities and waste disposal practices contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2006. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

**Current Status**

The site is currently undergoing operations and maintenance. The fourth five-year review report, completed in September 2013, determined that the remedy is functioning as intended and remains protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Long term protectiveness of the remedial action will be verified by continuing monitoring of groundwater to assess the effectiveness of the Site controls. The next five-year review will be completed in 2018.

The Site was deleted from the National Priorities List (Superfund) in August 2006.

**Background**  
Dixie Oil Processors (DOP) is a former industrial facility located approximately 20 miles southeast of Houston in Harris County Texas. DOP North was operated as a copper recovery and hydrocarbon washing facility from 1969 through 1978. A total of six surface pits were used to store and treat wastewater prior to recovery and discharge. The pits were closed between 1975 and 1977. Several operations occurred at DOP South from 1978 through 1986. These included hydrocarbon washing to produce various chemicals, oil recovery, and blending and distilling residues from local chemical plants and refineries to produce various petroleum products including fuel oil, creosote extender, and a molybdenum concentrate catalyst. Active operations at the site stopped in 1986. The EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for the DOP site on March 31, 1988. The ROD selecting limited action and monitoring, including fluids stabilization and a site cover with institutional controls.

**Benefits**

The completion of the construction of the containment remedy in 1993 provided long-term reduction of risk to human health. The soil cover over the site reduces the risk from direct contact with the residual wastes at the site.  
The site is classified as ready for anticipated use (non-residential).

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires continued groundwater monitoring to assess the effectiveness of the site controls.

Health Considerations

Following remediation there are no unacceptable risks at the Site. Prior to remediation, the risk assessment concluded there were elevated health risks associated with exposure to the wastes at the Site.

The Environmental Indicator status is human exposure under control; and ground water migration under control.

A copper recovery and hydrocarbon washing facility operated on the DOP north property from 1969 to 1978. Six surface pits were used to store and treat wastewater containing copper prior to recovery and discharge. The pits were closed and decommissioned in 1975 and 1977. Several operations occurred at DOP south between 1978 and 1986. These included hydrocarbon washing to produce various chemicals, oil recovery, and blending and distillation of residues from local chemical plants and refineries to produce petroleum products, including fuel oil, creosote extender and a molybdenum concentrate catalyst. Active operations stopped in 1986.A copper recovery and hydrocarbon washing facility operated on the DOP north property from 1969 to 1978.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included removal of surface contamination, improvement of surface water controls, reconstruction of Mud Gully and installation of a security fence. Cleanup actions also included removal and off-site disposal of tank wastes, breakdown of process tanks and drums, disposal of process equipment, and institutional controls. Remedy construction took place between 1992 and 1993. Site inspections and groundwater monitoring activities are ongoing.

Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2006.  

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
