### Background

The 240-acre Hamilton Island Landfill (USA/COE) site is in Skamania County, Washington. From 1977 to 1982, site operators used this unlined landfill to dispose of about 19 million cubic yards of material excavated during the construction of a powerhouse for the Bonneville dam; debris collected during the demolition of a nearby town; and chemical waste, paints and degreasers. Initial sampling indicated that site activities contaminated soil, sludge, groundwater and surface water with hazardous chemicals. However, the remedial investigation later determined that hazardous substances at Hamilton Island do not pose a risk to human health and the environment. EPA took the site off the Superfund programâ€™s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1995.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through state and federal actions.

This site is owned and managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USA/COE). About 900 people obtain their drinking water from wells located within four miles of the site. The Columbia River, a highly productive area for commercial and recreational fisheries, boating, sightseeing and wind surfing, is next to the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The Army fenced a portion of the site in 1987, restricting public access to the site and preventing direct contact with suspected contamination. In the fall of 1993, the Army began investigations into the nature and extent of site contamination. These investigations detected no hazardous wastes that required cleanup actions. Therefore, in 1995, EPA, the Washington Department of Ecology (WDOE) and the Army determined that no further action would be taken on Hamilton Island. Site monitoring is not required.

EPA placed the site on the NPL in 1992 and took the site off the NPL in 1995.
