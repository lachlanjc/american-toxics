### Background

The Ely Copper Mine Superfund Site is an abandoned copper mine located in Vershire, Orange County, Vermont, and encompasses approximately 350 acres where historic mining activities took place, including about 30 acres of waste material containing an estimated 172,000 tons of waste rock, tailings, ore roast beds, slag heaps, and smelter wastes. The Site also includes over 3,000 linear feet of Underground Mine Workings along with the associated shafts and adits. No buildings remain at the Site. Remnant foundations, pads, and stone walls, including a 1,400-foot-long smoke flue, demark the location of former Site structures including a former flotation mill and the smelter plant. The Site has been determined to be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places by EPA in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO).

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions. EPA completed the initial investigations and signed a Record of Decision for Operable Unit 1 in 2011. Operable Unit 1 will address the most significant sources of acid mine drainage by consolidating the waste rock, tailing, and contaminated sediments into an on-site containment cell that will be covered to minimize contact with water and oxygen. EPA completed additional investigations and signed a Record of Decision for Operable Unit 2 and Operable Unit 3 in June 2016. These cleanup actions will address the release of acid mine drainage from the Main Adit, Deep Adit, and Pollard Adit. It will also create groundwater use restrictions to prevent the consumption of contaminated groundwater contained within the underground workings.

Currently, Dwight Hill Forest, LLC. and Green Crow Corporation own the site property. Parts of the property are managed for commercial timberland.

The design for the OU1, OU2, and OU3 cleanup actions was completed in September 2019.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA began the pre-construction historic resource documentation for the Ely Copper Mine in 2023 and this work was completed in June 2024. This work involved archaeological and photographic documentation of historic resources prior to the start of the cleanup. This work was performed by a contractor working for the Vermont DEC and is funded by EPA through a Cooperative Agreement. EPA has retained the US Army Corps to procudre and manage the cleanup work. The US Army Corps awarded a contract for the tree clearing for the cleanup in February 2024 and that work was completed in March 2024.

The contract for the OU1/OU2/OU3 cleanup was awarded in May 2024 and the contractor should mobilize to the Site to begin the cleanup in September 2024.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

EPA and VTDEC have entered into settlement agreements with the current and past Site owners. One requirement of these settlement agreements is to implement land use restrictions on the Site. The land use restrictions were accomplished through a Grant of Environmental Restriction and Easement which was in effect as of May 2019. The entire area within OU1, OU2, OU3, and portions of OU4 cannot be used for residential purposes and groundwater use is prohibited.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The data from sampling events relating to the remedial investigation or remedial design can be found in the Remedial Investigation Report and Remedial Design Report. In October 2020, May 2021, and October 2021 EPA performed surface water sampling at the Ely Copper Mine.

### Enforcement Information

EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with former Site owner Ely Mine Forrest, Inc. with an effective date of October 11, 2011. EPA also completed a 2016 Settlement Agreement with Green Crow Corp., owner of land overlying the Underground Mine Workings deep below the surface, and Dwight Hill Forrest, Inc., the current owner of the Site.
