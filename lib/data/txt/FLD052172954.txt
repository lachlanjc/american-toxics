### Background

The BMI-Textron site is located in Lake Park, Florida, just north of West Palm Beach. It includes an area where various companies have conducted manufacturing operations since 1969. One company, BMI-Textron, performed soil cleanup actions at the site in 1984 and 1990. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1990 because of contaminated groundwater resulting from facility operations. EPA, Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and BMI-Textron, the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP), investigated site conditions and took steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. In 2002, after groundwater achieved drinking water standards, EPA took the site off the NPL. EPA does not anticipate additional work at the site.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The 3.4-acre site is located in Tri-City Industrial Park in the southwest section of Lake Park, Florida, just north of West Palm Beach. Commercial and industrial businesses, including a sign manufacturer, a stone wholesaler, a custom cabinet shop and an electrical contractor border the site to the north, east and west. A residential area, which includes low-income and minority residents, is located directly south of the site. The Trans Circuits, Inc. Superfund site is located one block northwest of the site. Basic Microelectronics, Inc. (BMI) began manufacturing operations in Lake Park in 1969. Textron Inc. acquired BMI in January 1981 and began operating at the site as BMI-Textron.

The BMI-Textron facility manufactured chromium-backed glass plates used in the production of electronic components. Liquid waste containing cyanide from the etching process was disposed of on-site through percolation ponds and drain fields for four years under an FDEP permit. Wells at the facility monitored compliance with the permit. In 1984, a state investigation found that site activities had contaminated soil and groundwater. The site’s potentially responsible party, BMI-Textron, cleaned up contaminated soil in 1984 and 1990.

In 1990, EPA listed the site on the NPL. BMI-Textron continued to conduct manufacturing operations during the cleanup process. Cleanup activities also included groundwater monitoring and site access restrictions. Florida Aero Precision later purchased the BMI-Textron site. Currently, Florida Aero Precision operates an aerospace parts manufacturing facility on site, which specializes in manufacturing turbine engine parts for industrial gas turbines and flight turbines.BMI-Textron, the site’s PRP, led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and FDEP.

In 1984, the PRP dug up soil from an abandoned percolation pond at the north-central end of the site, removing 680 cubic yards of cyanide-contaminated soil and transporting it to a hazardous waste facility regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). In 1990, the PRP removed chromium- and cyanide-contaminated soils from another percolation pond. As part of the effort, the PRP filled in the dug-up area with four feet of material and capped it with asphalt. In 1990, EPA listed the site on the NPL. BMI-Textron continued to conduct manufacturing operations during the cleanup process. Cleanup activities also included groundwater monitoring and site access restrictions. In 1994, the PRP started groundwater monitoring to confirm natural attenuatuation of the contamination.

The site’s only Five-Year Review, completed in 2000, concluded that the selected cleanup approach continued to protect people and the environment. In 2002, EPA took the site off the NPL after determining that the site’s PRP had implemented all appropriate response actions. EPA does not require additional Five-Year Reviews for the site and does not anticipate additional work at the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1994, EPA issued a cleanup plan for the site to return groundwater contaminant concentrations to levels below the drinking water standards. EPA chose monitored natural attenuation to achieve the standards, which also included monitoring groundwater quarterly for one year; monitoring groundwater annually for the remaining two years and reviewing groundwater monitoring results annually; using existing institutional controls to protect against exposure to contaminated groundwater; using existing wells for groundwater monitoring to make sure natural attenuation took place; and securing the site with fencing and a locked gate.

In 2002, after groundwater achieved drinking water standards, EPA deleted the site from the NPL. EPA does not anticipate additional work at the site. EPA does not require additional Five-Year Reviews for the site.

### Enforcement Information

In the 1980s, FDEP issued a series of consent orders requiring the site’s PRP to conduct soil-related cleanup actions. In the early 1990s, EPA ordered the PRP to investigate and clean up the site.
