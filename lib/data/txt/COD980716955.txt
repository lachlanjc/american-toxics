### Background

The Denver Radium site is located in Denver, Colorado, along the South Platte River Valley. The site consists of over 65 properties contaminated by radioactive residues derived from the processing of radium ore in the early 1900s. This site has been partially deleted from the National Priorities List of Superfund sites.

In 1913, the National Radium Institute was established in Denver as a domestic source of radium, which was used in cancer therapy and research. The radium, vanadium and uranium industry thrived in Denver until the early 1920s. Site properties throughout the area were contaminated by radioactive residues from the processing of radium ore, leading to soil and groundwater contamination. The Operable Units (OUs) are primarily in commercial and industrial use. OU2 is currently occupied by a scrapyard (Atlas Metal & Iron) and several other small businesses. OU3 is currently occupied by a packaging plant, a noodle shop, several other businesses and a rail line; it is also bordered to the south by Sanderson Gulch. OUs 4 and 9B are occupied by Home Depot. A new residential development is being constructed on OU8 on the former Shattuck property. The only portion of the site that remains on the National Priorities List is OU8 Groundwater, located beneath the Overland Golf Course. Surrounding land uses include commercial, industrial, residential, and recreational areas. Potable water at the site is provided by a municipal water supply. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing following cleanup. Five-year review (FYR) reports are published regularly.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

**OU1**: Remedial actions at OU1 took place between October 1989 and April 1991. Radiological contamination was removed and disposed of off-site.

**OU2**: Remedial actions at OU2 took place from August 1990 through August 1993. These actions resulted in the excavation and off-site disposal of 92,798 tons of radium-contaminated soil. A total of 14,211 tons of radiological- and lead-contaminated comingled material was excavated, stabilized and shipped off site.

**OU3:** Construction began in August 1989 and concluded in 1991. A total of 63,403 tons of contaminated material were excavated and shipped off site.

**OU4/5:** Construction began in August 1988 and concluded in March 1991. A total of 97,824 tons of radiologically-contaminated material was excavated and disposed of at an off-site disposal facility. About 2,100 tons of disposed material were contaminated with metals and radioactive material.

**OU6:** A total of 4,083 tons of radium-contaminated waste were removed between October 1990 and September 1991 and disposed of off-site.

**OU7:** Remedial activities were performed from June 2003 to October 2003. These activities included removal of impacted asphalt, curb, gutter, and sub-grade materials from the contaminated roadways. Waste was disposed of off-site.

**OU8:** Radium-contaminated buildings were demolished and radium-contaminated soils were removed from vicinity properties. About 2,000 cubic yards of oil-impacted soil were excavated and transported off site. Bioremediation was used for the oil-impacted soils that extended beneath the completed portion of the monolith. EPA approved a bio-system to treat remaining oil-impacted soils, and it was installed in September 1998. Implementation of the remedy began in September 2002 and finished in September 2006. All waste material was removed from the property. About 243,872 tons of contaminated materials were excavated and disposed of as part of the combined work at both the Shattuck Chemical property and Bannock Street. Radiologically-contaminated material was sent off site.

**OU8 Groundwater:** The groundwater at OU8 is the only portion of the Denver Radium Superfund site that remains on the National Priorities List. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing.

**OU9A:** Remediation activities were conducted in March 1991 and involved the removal and disposal of 759 tons of contaminated materials.

**OU9B:** Demolition and excavation activities were performed from 1995 to 1996 and soils exceeding the site screening criteria were capped. Excavations resulting from the radiological cleanup were backfilled.

**OU10:** Remedial activities were conducted from September 1988 to September 1989. Contaminated materials were excavated and disposed of, and three underground storage tanks and abandoned utilities were removed,

**OU11:** Remediation activities were conducted from June 1991 to August 1991. Approximately 786 tons of contaminated material was excavated and disposed of off-site.

Five-year reviews conducted at the site ensure that the remedies put in place both protect public health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review, published September 2023, concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short-term. (See the complete review in [Featured Documents](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.docdata&id=0800247#FeatDocs) ).

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1983. EPA published a Federal Register notice in September 2010 to partially delete the site, except for OU8 Groundwater.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The majority of the site has been cleaned up and deleted from the National Priorities List (NPL). OU8 Groundwater continues to be monitored and remains on the NPL.

The site consists of 11 areas, referred to by EPA as operable units (OUs). Each OU addresses a different location. Long-term remedies at the OUs included soil excavation and off-site disposal, capping, installation of ventilation systems to mitigate radon gas, natural attenuation of groundwater contamination, and institutional controls. There are five OUs (2, 3, 4, 8 and 9B) where waste remains in place and properties are not available for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing at these OUs.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

There are five OUs (2, 3, 4, 8 and 9B) where waste remains in place and properties are not available for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. For these Operable Units, Institutional Controls (ICs) are used to minimize the potential for human exposure to waste left in place. These ICs include inspections, restrictions on groundwater use, a system to alert the City and County of Denver if excavation is occurring on-site, indoor air monitoring, among others.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Ongoing groundwater monitoring is being conducted on OU3 and OU8 Groundwater. Groundwater monitoring of OU9B is temporarily on hold during the I-25 construction project.
