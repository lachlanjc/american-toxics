### Background

The Crown Vantage Landfill site is a 10-acre former landfill in Alexandria Township, New Jersey. The landfill has an estimated 1,500 feet of frontage directly on the eastern shore of the Delaware River. The nearby former Curtis Specialty Papers mill, as well as other nearby Riegel Paper Company facilities, disposed of wastes at the landfill from the late 1930s through the early 1970s. These paper mill-related wastes included flyash from coal burning; drums containing pressroom wastes such as varnish, shellac, methyl ethyl ketone, inks, and dyes; as well as paper fiber sludge and rolls of aluminum foil-laminated paper. The landfill may also have accepted flood-damaged items from the local community, including appliances and furniture, following record flooding of the Delaware River in 1955.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Site characterization began with investigations conducted in 1991 with oversight by New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). In 1994, monitoring wells were installed and the ground water quality was characterized. From 2001 through 2003, the NJDEP fenced the site, removed additional surface debris, including drums, and collected surface soil samples. At NJDEP’s request, in 2003 and 2004 the EPA conducted additional sampling of surface water, sediment, surface soil and fly ash, and ground water. Contaminants were found in surface soil, sediments and fly ash from burning coal. Additional wastes were removed from the landfill surface and riprap was placed in flood-impacted areas.

The Site was proposed to be added to the National Priorities List in 2004 and formally added in 2005. In May 2005, Fort James Operating Company, a subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific, entered into an Administrative Agreement and Order on Consent (AOC) for a Removal Action with EPA. Under the 2005 AOC, additional surficial drums were removed, additional fencing was provided, and an engineered wall was constructed to stabilize the landfill’s western face. These activities were completed in September 2007. In total, over 700 surficial drums, drum remnants and drum carcasses were removed from the surface of the Site during investigations conducted between 1991 and 2007.

The risks posed by the site are addressed through a forested cover that prevents humans and ecological receptors from being exposed to landfill materials. In addition, to keep trespassers from entering the site, the landfill is fenced with and posted warning signs, and there is security surveillance.

In September 2007, Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products, LP (GPCP) signed an AOC for a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) with EPA and in December 2007, International Paper Company (IP) was issued a Unilateral Administrative Order by EPA for a Removal Action and RI/FS. The RI/FS was conducted from 2008 to 2011.

In September 2011, EPA issued a Record of Decision that included: establishment of a deed restriction to ensure that future site uses do not disturb the surface of the site; continued maintenance of security measures (e.g., signage and fencing); continued maintenance of the slope stabilization wall; sealing of remaining shallow monitoring wells; semi-annual monitoring of the site, including the slope stabilization wall; and five-year reviews of the remedy.

The cleanup remedy was conducted pursuant to a Consent Decree entered in Court on April 11, 2013. In September 2013 EPA issued a Preliminary Close-Out Report and in December 2014 issued a Final Close-Out Report. A notice of intent to delete the site from the NPL was published in the Federal Register on April 29, 2015. The notice of deletion was published on July 29, 2015 and the deletion became effective on August 28, 2015.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site currently is monitored on a semi-annual basis and is subject to a formal review by EPA at least once every five years to ensure it remains protective of human health and the environment. The first five year review was issued in December 2017. The second five year review was issued in November 2022.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

There is a deed notice on the property at the site to control exposure to the landfill materials and to protect the forested cover and slope stabilization wall along the Delaware River.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The monitoring includes site inspection reports twice a year and maintenance of the slope stabilization wall, fencing and signage. The monitoring also includes certifications every two years of the deed notice.
