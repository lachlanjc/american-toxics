### Background

**Current Status**

The site’s long-term remedy included construction of a consolidation cell; excavation and consolidation of contaminated materials in the cell; construction of a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) cap over the cell; building decontamination and demolition; reconstruction and relocation of airport facilities; and fencing around the cell. Remedy construction took place between 1990 and 1991. Cap and fence maintenance and inspections, and monitoring of a nearby municipal water supply well are ongoing.

Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1995.

**Site Background**

The 120-acre Crystal City Airport site is located in Crystal City, Texas. From the 1950s to 1982, several aerial pesticide application businesses operated at the site. Site activities and waste disposal practices by the pesticide businesses contaminated soil with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1995. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

Several aerial pesticide applicating businesses that operated at the airport from early 1950s until 1982 left surface principal pollutants at the Crystal City Superfund site which include arsenic compounds (1,450 ppm) and pesticides, specifically DDT (2,400 ppm) and toxaphene (1,100 ppm). Approximately 12,000 cubic yards of contaminated material wastes have been removed by verification monitoring that is now consolidated in the onsite vault.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state and federal actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires site inspections, monitoring, mowing and maintenance, and observance of the deed notice.

The Crystal City Airport began operating during World War II as a military installation. In 1949, the U.S. Government deeded the airport to the city. Beginning in the 1950s, several aerial pesticide application businesses began operating at the site. By 1982, these operations ceased and the businesses declared bankruptcy and abandoned their equipment and deteriorated drums at the site. In 1983, the state inspected the site and found over 70 drums of waste pesticides in various stages of decomposition.The Crystal City Airport began operating during World War II as a military installation.

EPA has completed the FY 2021 Five Year Review for the Crystal City Airport Superfund Site. EPA finalized the report by June 8, 2021. EPA is currently working on a follow-up action from the FY 2021 FYR Five Year Review. The document was entered on the Site webpage on June 25, 2021 and is now available at the local repository..

### Sampling and Monitoring

TCEQ performs groundwater sampling every five years at the Site. They also perform operations and maintenance activities. In May 7, 2020, TCEQ performed both groundwater and site operations and maintenance activites at the Site. EPA expects to get the results of these activities in the FY 2020 Operations and Maintenance Report. EPA will make this report avaialbe to the public by late summer 2020.
