Background
The 20-acre Harvey & Knott Drum, Inc. site is located in Kirkwood, Delaware. From 1963 to 1969, Harvey & Knott Drum, Inc. operated an open dump and burning area on a portion of the site. The facility accepted sanitary, municipal and industrial wastes, including sludge, paint pigments and solvents. Operators dumped wastes onto the ground or into excavated trenches, left waste in drums, or buried waste at the site. These activities contaminated groundwater, surface water, soil and sediment with hazardous chemicals. The Site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) on September 8, 1983.﻿ Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In 1982, EPA installed a fence around the disposal area and staged leaky drums for removal. Seventeen monitoring wells were installed to identify the nature and extent of groundwater contamination. The Site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) on September 8, 1983.﻿ In 1983 and 1984, 46 leaky drums were removed and a soil berm and surface drainage ditch were constructed. EPA entered into a mixed funding agreement with General Motors (GM) to design and implement the full remedy laid out in the 1985 Record of Decision. GM removed over 100 additional drums, 955 cubic yards of contaminated soil, and approximately 180,000 gallons of water pumped from the pond in the disposal area. The Record of Decision was modified in 1992. This modification, known as an Explanation of Significant Differences, included capping lead-contaminated soils, excavating the pond and sediments, and starting the groundwater and surface water monitoring program. The water monitoring program continues today. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
The cleanup of the site, which included capping contaminated soil and excavating contaminated sediments was completed in June 1994. Groundwater and surface water monitoring is ongoing and will ensure that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the Site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by Site decision documents. The most recent 2023 Five-Year Review (PDF) concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term based on the current use and average lead concentration in soil outside the capped area. The groundwater portion of the remedy remains protective as no groundwater contamination over drinking water maximum contaminant levels is reaching the wells that are downgradient of the contamination. However, in order for the remedy to be protective in the long term, the additional lead soils found adjacent to the cap need to be addressed in accordance with the Record of Decision and Explanation of Significant Differences, or additional decision document, if necessary. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2028.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Institutional controls are in placed to restrict groundwater use and protect the remedy cap. Additional information about the institutional controls are available in the 2023 Five-Year Review (PDF) (page 11).
