### Background

In the early 1960s, the 17-acre BFI Sanitary Landfill (Rockingham) site served as a borrow area for the construction of Interstate 91. In 1973, Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc. (BFI) bought the landfill from an individual who had started operations in 1968. State files indicate that industrial wastes, including heavy metals, bases, pesticides, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were deposited in the unlined disposal area from 1968 to 1979. In 1983, Vermont licensed the site as a municipal landfill certified to accept hazardous waste from small quantity generators. The BFI Rockingham Landfill Superfund Site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1989. In 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signed an Action Memorandum to initiate a Non-Time Critical Removal Action (NTCRA). The NTCRA include the placement of a multi-layer cap over the landfill; expansion of the existing landfill gas management system; operation and maintenance of the Route 5 Stabilization and Seepage Control System shallow groundwater collection trench; and institutional controls (ICs). In 1994, EPA signed a Record of Decision (ROD) selecting monitored natural attenuation and ICs as the long-term cleanup approach for the restoration of contaminated groundwater. Construction of the NTCRA action was completed in July 1995 and EPA certified the Completion of Work Report in September 1996.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. Two CERCLA cleanup actions have been implemented at the Site. The first was a non-time critical removal action (NTCRA) documented in a 1993 Action Memorandum. The NTCRA included construction of the multilayer landfill cap and the Route 5 Slope Stabilization and Seepage Control System (Route 5 System). The Route 5 System consists of a shallow overburden groundwater collection trench. The trench is bounded by sheet piling and was designed to intercept a limited area of impacted overburden groundwater that historically discharged at the top of ravines located adjacent to Route 5. This water is collected in an aboveground storage tank (AST) for offsite treatment and disposal. Other NTCRA components included the expansion of the gas extraction system and ICs to protect the cap. The multilayer cap was constructed with a slope of 3:1 and included: a gas vent layer, a compacted low permeability native soil layer, a very low density, polyethylene geo-membrane, a storm water drainage tire chip layer, vegetative support soil and topsoil. The second cleanup action described in the ROD called for the natural attenuation of groundwater, continued maintenance of the NTCRA, long-term monitoring, and ICs.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Construction of the cap and expansion of the active gas collection and treatment system was completed in 1995. Site PRPs operate and maintain the cap and leachate collection and treatment system and provide drinking water to nearby residential properties.

An Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) for the Site was completed in September 2014. The ESD addressed why the bedrock groundwater cleanup at the site had not met the Interim Groundwater Cleanup Levels (IGCLs) established in the ROD and revised the timeframe for the restoration of bedrock groundwater to the IGCLs to between 2050 and 2070, and achievement of the IGCLs established in the ROD for VOCs by 2025. It also revised the IGCLs for arsenic and lead because of changes in federal and state standards for those chemicals and it documented the implementation of the additional ICs at the Site.

There have been no new remedial activities implemented at the Site since the installation of a candlestick flare in August 2017. The new flare replaced the original enclosed flare that required a relatively large amount of gas to burn, resulting in more frequent flare shutdowns as the landfill matures and generates lower amounts of landfill gas. Because the new candlestick flare requires less gas to burn, it operates more continuously and therefore provides better long-term control of potential gas migration and landfill odors.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**  
  
This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.  
  
The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.

### Sampling and Monitoring

A vapor intrusion investigation for the Site completed in 2015 did not indicate that vapor intrusion was a pathway of concern. Operation and maintenance of the landfill cap, drinking water supply system, gas management system and leachate and shallow groundwater seepage follow standard operating procedures and continue to maintain the effectiveness of site remediation.
