### Background

The Rockaway Township Wells site is located in Rockaway Township, New Jersey. The site is a 2-square-mile well field area containing a cluster of three municipal wells within 100 feet of each other. In 1979 and 1980, the wells were found to contain a variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs are potentially harmful contaminants that can easily evaporate into the air. Two gasoline service stations, freight and transit facilities, and industrial properties are located near the well field. Groundwater contamination in the area appears to have resulted from several sources, including the gasoline stations and industrial facilities. Long-term soil and groundwater treatment are ongoing.

Water samples in 1979 and 1980 first indicated the presence of VOCs. Rockaway Township installed an activated carbon adsorption treatment system. The water then developed an unpleasant taste and odor. On October 10, 1980, the Township declared a water emergency. An air stripper was subsequently installed at the site for additional treatment.

After additional investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1983.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Groundwater: Following a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the nature and extent of contamination and to evaluate remedial alternatives, EPA selected the remedy in the site’s October 1993 Record of Decision, or ROD. The remedy includes extraction of contaminated groundwater, air stripping and reinjection of treated groundwater, and replacement of the Rockaway Township air stripping system. A potentially responsible party (PRP) replaced the air stripping system with a new air stripping system in May 1995, as called for in the ROD. Construction of the remedy finished in June 2005.

Source Control: Additional investigations further delineated potential contamination sources within Denville Technical Park, the source of the groundwater contamination. EPA selected soil vapor extraction as the remedy for contaminated soils at Denville Technical Park in the site’s October 2002 ROD. Construction of the remedy finished in June 2005. The treatment system extracts and treats soil vapors and contaminated groundwater from beneath the site.Because of nationwide concerns regarding vapor intrusion at sites with VOC-contaminated groundwater, the soil vapor intrusion pathway was evaluated. Sampling in February and March 2010 showed elevated concentrations of VOCs below several buildings on the site, indicating the potential for vapor intrusion. The presence of some of the chemicals has been attributed to chemical usage in the buildings. However, subslab vapor concentrations indicate vapor intrusion is also a concern. As a result, sub-slab depressurization systems were installed in Building 1 and Building 2 to prevent soil vapors from entering the buildings. Operation, maintenance and monitoring activities for these systems are ongoing to ensure their continued effectiveness. Annual inspections are performed for the suction points, piping, and fans, and in 2021 six of the seven suction fans were replaced.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in two long-term remedial phases focused on cleanup of groundwater contamination and the sources of the contamination.

A ROD was issued in October 1993 which selected an extraction and treatment remedy to address the contaminated groundwater. A 2002 ROD was issued for the source operable unit and a modification to the groundwater remedy selected in the 1993 ROD. Construction of both remedies was simultaneously completed in June 2005.

Soil and groundwater treatment are ongoing.

### Sampling and Monitoring

A groundwater treatment system (GWTS) and a soil vapor extraction (SVE) system are in operation at the site to remediate groundwater and soil impacted by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from historic operations at the site. Long-term groundwater and soil vapor monitoring are performed to track the performance of the remedial systems and to evaluate compliance with the remediation goals. The GWTS consists of three extraction wells and three dual-phase wells that pump VOC-impacted groundwater from the regional overburden and perched aquifers to an air stripper system. The effectiveness of the GWTS is monitored by collecting monthly combined influent and quarterly combined effluent groundwater samples for laboratory analyses for VOCs. In addition, a groundwater monitoring network consisting of 16 monitoring wells (and the three extraction wells) is sampled on an annual basis for laboratory analyses of VOCs and 1,4-dioxane.

In support of the GWTS, sub-slab depressurization systems (SSDSs) were constructed and commissioned in Building 1 (November 2010) and Building 2 (July 2010) at the site. The results from post-commissioning sampling indicated that the SSDSs were effective in reducing the indoor air concentrations of site-related contaminants below their respective screening levels. Annual inspections of the SSDSs are performed to ensure that they remain protective of vapor intrusion.

The SVE system consists of 10 SVE wells and three dual-phase wells that route VOC-impacted soil gas to vapor-phase carbon units for treatment. The effectiveness of the SVE system is monitored by collecting monthly effluent and quarterly influent combined air samples and semi-annual influent air samples from select SVE wells for laboratory analysis for VOCs. The analytical data indicate that air permit requirements are being met for operation of the SVE system.
