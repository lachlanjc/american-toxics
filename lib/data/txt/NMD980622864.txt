### Background

The 89-acre AT&SF Albuquerque site is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. A wood-treating plant operated on site from 1908 until 1972. Operations used creosote and oil mixtures for manufacturing of pressure-treated wood products. In 1972, dismantling of the plant took place and only the wastewater reservoir and sump remained on site. Operations contaminated soil and groundwater. Routine inspections, groundwater treatment and groundwater monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the siteâ€™s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires implementation of recommended actions.

The closest residential area is about a half-mile to the southwest and a single mobile home is located about 600 feet west of the site. Two major residential areas are located about two miles north and one-and-a-half miles south of the site. Major population centers are located west of the Rio Grande, north of Woodward Drive and east of Interstate 25.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The long-term remedy includes in-place solidification, stabilization and phytoremediation of contaminated soil. It also includes capping, surface water management, excavation and off-site incineration of dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL)-contaminated soil, treatment of groundwater, removal of DNAPL sources, treatment of hot spots, and implementation of institutional controls. EPA updated the remedy to change the extent of the area for excavation, treatment and capping of soil; change performance criteria for treated contaminated soil; and remove phytoremediation as a requirement for contaminated soil treatment. Construction of the remedy took place from 2008 to 2011. Routine inspections, groundwater treatment and groundwater monitoring are ongoing.  

### Sampling and Monitoring

The Remedial Action Report contains soil and water sampling data collected during the construction of the remedy. The site is currently collecting sample data from monitoring wells and the ground water treatment plant. This data is submitted to EPA on a quarterly basis.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions in 1990 included removal and disposal of about 8,250 tons of debris from plant demolition and excavation of about 45,000 square feet of soil from the wastewater reservoir. Additional removal actions in 1996 included excavation of contaminated soil and backfilling of clean soil. In 1999, removal actions included excavation of sludge and process residue from the wastewater reservoir, off-site disposal of excavated materials and installation of three recovery trenches were installed to collect DNAPL. A removal action in 2000 installed five recovery pumps to extract DNAPL from groundwater.
