### Background

The Southside Sanitary Landfill site occupies 312 acres in Indianapolis, Indiana. The landfill is an active solid waste disposal facility that began operating in 1971. An estimated four million cubic yards of waste, including coal tar, asbestos, iron oxide and clarifier sludges, and paint waste, were buried at the landfill, leading to soil and groundwater contamination. Following cleanup, groundwater monitoring is ongoing. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1997.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s final remedy is in place. Southside Sanitary Landfill continues to operate on site under a RCRA permit monitored by the State of Indiana.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. EPA has determined that additional five-year reviews of the remedy are not warranted at this time.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s remedy includes a hydraulic cutoff barrier (known as a slurry wall) and a leachate collection system. The remedy prevents contaminated groundwater from leaving the site, eliminating the potential treat to surrounding areas. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing. Institutional controls are in place and effective.

Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1997.  

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Groundwater is contaminated with heavy metals including arsenic, chromium, cadmium, and nickel. On-site soils were contaminated with plycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
