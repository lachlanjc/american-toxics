### Background

The 18-acre Prestolite Battery Division site is located on U.S. Highway 41 northwest of Vincennes in Knox County, Indiana. The Prestolite Battery facility manufactured lead-acid batteries, primarily for use in cars and trucks, on site from 1945 to 1985. Plant operations contaminated soil with lead and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and groundwater, sediment, and surface water with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and metals. Following immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, long term monitoring is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s long-term remedy includes deed restrictions to limit groundwater use and monitored natural attenuation of groundwater. Natural attenuation describes a variety of in-place processes that, under favorable conditions, act without human intervention to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume or concentration of contaminants in groundwater.

EPA and IDEM recently completed the fifth five-year review of the selected cleanup action at site. The report was completed on September 15, 2021. A final copy of the report was placed in the site’s local document repository, located at the Knox County Public Library, and is also available online, [Fifth Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/969400). The review concluded that the site remedy is currently protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy includes deed restrictions to limit groundwater use and monitored natural attenuation of groundwater. Natural attenuation describes a variety of in-place processes that, under favorable conditions, act without human intervention to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume or concentration of contaminants in groundwater.

EPA and IDEM are currently conducting the fifth five year review of the selected cleanup action at the site. The review will be completed by September 2021. A final copy of the report will be placed in the site’s local document repository, located at the Knox County Public Library, and will also be available online.

As part of the five year review process, EPA staff are available to answer any questions about the site. Community members who have questions about the site or the review process are asked to contact: [Lauren Bumba](mailto:bumba.lauren@epa.gov), EPA Remedial Project Manager, at (312) 886-4844 or via email (bumba.lauren@epa.gov) or [Janet Pope](mailto:pope.janet@epa.gov), EPA Community Involvement Coordinator, at (312) 353-0628 or via email (pope.janet@epa.gov).

### Sampling and Monitoring

The PRP conducts annual groundwater, surface water, and sediment sampling (alternating months between June and September). The most recent completed summary can be found in the [Jacobs – 2020 Annual Sampling Report (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/2003327). Since the last sampling event was conducted in June 2020, the next sampling event is scheduled for September 2021.

### Emergency Response and Removal

In October 2007, EPA negotiated an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (ASAOC) with Allied Signal’s successor, Honeywell International, Inc. (Honeywell), for the removal of lead-contaminated soils at the nearby Huffer's Garage Property, where lead levels were above the site cleanup level of 530 ppm lead. Under the ASAOC, Honeywell, under EPA and State of Indiana oversight, excavated approximately 6,750 tons of treated, lead-stabilized soil from seven areas ranging in depth from 1 foot to 2.5 feet and disposed of this lead-stabilized soil in a licensed landfill.
