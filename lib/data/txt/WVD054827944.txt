### Background

The Big John's Salvage - Hoult Road Superfund Site is located in the northeast portion of the city of Fairmont, West Virginia, on the eastern bank of the Monongahela River along the western edge of WV Route 150 (Hoult Road). The former industrial property covers 38 acres, approximately 20 of which were used for coal tar refining, salvage operations, and waste disposal (Uplands Areas). The remaining 18 acres include a low-lying drainage area that discharges to the Monongahela River at the western portion of the property and wooded hillsides in the northern and eastern portions of the property. In July 2000, the site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List, making it eligible for long-term investigation and cleanup.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Between 1925 and 1973, the site was owned by Reilly Corporation or its predecessor companies (Reilly, later doing business as Vertellus) and was used primarily in the processing of approximately 12,000 gallons per day of crude tar from the adjacent Domestic Coke Corporation (predecessor of ExxonMobil).

In January 1973, Reilly sold its property on Hoult road to Big John’s Salvage, who owned and operated a metal, glass and oil salvaging operation at the site until 1984. During this time of ownership, Big John Salvage accepted various scrap and salvageable materials from Westinghouse Electric, including crushed fluorescent light bulbs containing mercury and other hazardous substances, lead dust and mercury-tainted waste oil.

From 1984 through 2017 property changed ownership several times via Sheriff’s sale due to failure to pay property taxes. The two primary parcels that comprise the site are currently owned by the Vertellus Environmental Response Trust and the Fairmont Custodial Trust and the to facilitate cleanup.

In 2000, Viacom (successor to Westinghouse) entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) with EPA, wherein they agreed to address the cullet piles and to stabilize other areas so that hazardous materials would not leave the site. The cullet piles were then excavated and sent to appropriately permitted facilities for disposal.

EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order (UAO) directing Reilly to undertake certain response actions necessary to prevent the release of coal tar-related hazardous substances to the environment. Reilly stabilized the site by cleaning out oily wastes from tributaries and installing a collection and treatment system capable of capturing a majority of oily, tar-like, contamination moving down the East and Middle tributaries toward the Sharon Steel Run.

In September 2010, EPA issued an action memorandum selecting the response action required to clean up the site. The memorandum requires:

- Dredging and removal of sediment from the Monongahela River.
- The construction of a multi-layered Subtitle D landfill cap at the Uplands Area to contain contaminated soil and sediments. The cap will be designed in a manner that will allow the site to be safely redeveloped or to provide wildlife habitat.
- Updating the existing groundwater containment and treatment system.

In October 2012, three companies – Vertellus Specialties Inc. (Vertellus), Exxon Mobil Corp., and CBS Corp. – entered into a consent decree with EPA and the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) agreeing to perform cleanup work selected in the action memorandum and to reimburse the EPA and the state of West Virginia $11 million for past cleanup costs at the site. Under the terms of the consent decree, Vertellus was the “Performing Defendant” and the others were Non-Performing, or “Cash Out” Defendants.

Between September 2013 and May 2016, Vertellus operated the on-site groundwater collection and treatment facility and began the process of developing a design to implement the response actions selected in the September 2010 Action Memo with EPA and WVDEP oversight. In May 2016, Vertellus filed for Bankruptcy which was approved by the Courts in April 2017.

In December 2016, EPA formally took over the work responsibilities and secured financial assurance funds established in accordance with the consent decree. The takeover of water treatment plant operations was coordinated so there was no lapse in operations.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Work is currently ongoing to prevent the release of tar seeps to surface water and the Monongahela River. Since 2001, more than 23.8 million gallons of contaminated water have been captured in a collection system and cleansed in a series of water treatment systems before they could enter the river.

In April 2017, the US Army Corps of Engineers was retained to complete the design for the dredging and removal of tar and contaminated sediment from the Monongahela River. Related investigations completed in late 2019 determined that there are more contaminated sediments in the river than were anticipated in the 2010 Action Memo. EPA signed an updated 2023 Action Memo to approve the change in scope and add funding to continue a Non-Time Critical Removal Action at the site.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included several past removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions from 1983 to the present include removing piles of crushed fluorescent light bulbs containing mercury and lead; controlling the migration of contaminants from the site with engineering controls; cleaning out oily wastes from tributaries; and installing a collection and treatment system to capture a majority of the oily, tar-like contamination moving down the East and Middle tributary toward Sharon Steel Run.
