### Background

The Verona Well Field is located in Battle Creek, Michigan. Site contamination impacted three aquifers and 27 drinking water wells over a 160-acre area. EPA determined that the sources of contamination were three 1-acre facilities. The Thomas Solvent Company used two facilities for storage, blending and containerization of solvents; the Grand Trunk Western Railroad operated a paint shop on the third facility. Leakage from containers and underground storage tanks, spillage, and direct dumping contaminated the soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

The site’s long-term remedy included blocking the migration of contaminated groundwater, soil vapor extraction, groundwater extraction and treatment, groundwater monitoring, and institutional controls. In addition, impacted residences received public water access. Construction of the remedy took place between 1987 and 2010. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires attainment of cleanup standards and monitoring and evaluation of institutional controls.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA recently finished a status review of the site’s ongoing cleanup operations and maintenance. These reviews are done every five years to ensure that the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This is the fifth five-year review for this site. A report detailing this review, in which the site’s remedy was found continuing to be protective of human health and the environment, is available under “Site Documents and Data”.
