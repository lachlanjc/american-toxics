### Background

The Janeville Disposal Facilities are located on a 65-acre parcel of land on Black Bridge Road in Rock County, Wisconsin.

The Janesville Ash Beds site operated from 1974 to 1985. It comprises five ash beds in an area about 400 feet by 400 feet. Industrial liquids and sludges were deposited in this area and allowed to evaporate. Dried sludge was then disposed of in two adjacent landfills: the " [Old Landfill](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/janesville-landfill )," another Superfund site, and the "New Landfill." Both are now closed.

The primary contaminants in the groundwater were volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as tetrachloroethene, trichloroethene, and vinyl chloride. The area surrounding the ash beds is industrial property and vacant land. There are no private residential wells or municipal supply wells in the line of the groundwater plume between the facility and the Rock River, the groundwater discharge point. However, there are about 12 homes within one-half mile to the northwest of the site. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA’s groundwater cleanup at the Janesville Old Landfill (and Janesville Ash Beds), consisted of several actions including a landfill cap and gas collection and treatment systems which continue to prevent exposure to waste materials and minimize the flow of water through the waste mass. Natural processes appear to be controlling and reducing groundwater contaminant levels. All necessary controls are in place and are being enforced. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing. All immediate health threats have been addressed. There are no unsafe exposures to site-related contaminants.

Several companies and the city of Janesville were responsible for the contamination. Today, EPA and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, oversee, review and approve their work. The city of Janesville serves as the agent for the group by monitoring and maintaining the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is conducting a five-year review of the Janesville Old Landfill and Janesville Ash Beds. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This is the fifth review of the Janesville sites.

More information is available at the Hedberg Public Library, 316 S. Main St., Janesville, and on this web page under Site Documents & Data. The review should be completed by July 2021.

The five-year-review is an opportunity for you to tell EPA about site conditions and any concerns you have. Contact the community involvement coordinator or remedial project manager.

### Enforcement Information

A group comprised of several companies and the city of Janesville is responsible for the cleanup. According to a legal agreement, EPA and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources oversee, review and approve their work.
