### Background

The Estech General Chemicals Co. site is an inactive facility located in a heavily industrialized area at 150 Marble Street, Calumet City, Cook County, Illinois. An abandoned building, historically part of the pesticide plant, is the only remaining structure on site. A three to four-acre wetland and aquatic area is in the northwest portion of the site.

The Estech General Chemicals Corporation manufactured, stored, and disposed of pesticides and fertilizers at the facility from 1952 until 1969. After Estech ceased operations at the site, it was used as a disposal location for demolition debris, construction debris and special wastes. The disposed special waste included shredded automobile interiors and soft parts, referred to as “auto fluff” or “white goods fluff”.

Contaminants were discovered up to 20 feet deep in a 7.5-acre lagoon, groundwater, sediment, and site soils. The property borders the Grand Calumet River, which has a fish consumption advisory due to the presence of PCBs. In 1999, EPA placed a cap over 27 acres of auto fluff, consisting of a layer of 12 inches of clay and topsoil.

The rule to place the Estech General Chemical Company Site on the National Priority List (NPL) was finalized on September 30, 2015. The site was originally proposed for addition to the NPL on March 2015.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In Spring 2020, EPA began the remedial investigation by conducting the first phase of soil, groundwater, surface water, and sediment sampling at the site. The sampling results will help determine the extent of contamination at the site that resulted from historical industrial and dumping activities. The sampling results will also help EPA develop cleanup alternatives that are protective of human health and the environment. Fencing was installed in 2020 to limit access to the site area.

The second phase of sampling activities is ongoing.
