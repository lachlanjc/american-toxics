### Background

The 6-acre Jadco-Hughes Facility [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) Site is located on Cason Street in Belmont, Gaston County, North Carolina. A neighborhood that includes low-income residents borders the site to the north. Commercial businesses border the site to the south. A forested area borders the site to the east. Cason Street and commercial businesses border the site to the west. Catawba Heights Elementary School is located east of the site but has not been affected by site contamination. The site’s broader surroundings include residential and commercial land uses.

The site includes an area where C.A. Hughes operated a solvent reclamation and storage facility from 1971 to 1975 and Jadco stored chemical waste drums in 1975. From 1971 to 1975, C.A. Hughes operated a solvent reclamation and storage facility at the site. Operations included reprocessing of chemical waste from industries to recover usable materials and storage of the materials on site. Jadco’s operations ended in late 1975.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1986 because of contaminated groundwater and soil resulting from facility operations and waste handling practices at the site.

The EPA, the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (now known as the [North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NC DEQ)](https://deq.nc.gov/), and the site’s [potentially responsible party (PRP)](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) Steering Committee, a subset of the site’s PRP Group, have investigated site conditions. By treating groundwater and soil, placing institutional controls on the site property, and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, the EPA, NC DEQ and the site’s PRPs continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. A water line connects nearby residences and businesses to the public water supply.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The EPA, the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (now known as the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NC DEQ)Exit, and the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP) Steering Committee, a subset of the site’s PRP Group, have investigated site conditions.

**1978**  
By 1978, the site’s PRPs had removed 18,000 drums of waste from the site, placed contaminated soil in an unlined landfill on site, and regraded the site.

**1983**  
The PRPs removed additional bulk storage tanks and other drums from the site.

**1990**  
EPA selected the site’s long-term remedy in a [Record of Decision (ROD)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/10410082.pdf). The cleanup plan included:

- using a soil vapor extraction (SVE) system and flushing soil with uncontaminated water;
- extracting and treating contaminated groundwater;
- discharging treated groundwater to the local water treatment plant;
- placing institutional controls on the site property to limit land uses and to prohibit the use of groundwater at the site; and
- placing a fence around the site to limit access.

**1994**  
EPA updated the cleanup plan in 1994, including soil sampling following soil cleanup activities to determine whether soil leachate meets groundwater cleanup goals.

**1996**  
The PRPs began soil and groundwater treatment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11050391.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2016. The remedy at the Site currently protects human and the environment in the short term because active remediation of source soil and sediment contamination is complete, groundwater contamination is being treated, there is no human exposure to contaminated groundwater and most institutional controls have been implemented.

EPA and the site’s PRPs are working to implement the recommendations from the Five-Year Review. Soil and ground water treatment are ongoing. EPA completed the last Five-Year Review in 2016 and plans to complete the next Five-Year Review in 2021.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Fencing surrounds the site and limits access.

Institutional controls were placed on the site property to limit land uses and to prohibit the use of groundwater at the site.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRP Group to investigate and clean up the site. The PRP Group continues to fund site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
