### Background

The 1.25-acre Pagano Salvage site is located one mile southeast of Los Lunas in Valencia County, New Mexico, near the east bank of the Rio Grande. In 1983, Pagano Salvage purchased electric transformers/capacitors containing polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated oil from Sandia National Laboratories, a U.S. Department of Energy facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Pagano Salvage removed the oil, poured it over insulated wire and burned off the insulation to recover the metal. The burning took place on unprotected ground at several locations. Following the site’s cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1992.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site was remediated. No future remedial activities are planned. A removal action addressed all significant site risks. EPA selected “no further action” for the site in the site’s 1999 Record of Decision.

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1992.
