### Background

The Letterkenny Army Depot is located five miles north of Chambersburg in Franklin County, PA. The U.S. Army established the 19,243-acre facility in 1942 for ammunition storage, and since 1947 the facility has been used for military purposes associated with munitions and vehicle maintenance. There are two Superfund program National Priority List (NPL) sites associated with the Letterkenny Army Depot: the Property Disposal Office (PDO) site and the Southeast (SE) Area site. This narrative addresses the SE Area site, which was added to the NPL on July 22, 1987.

The Letterkenny Army Depot SE Area site includes areas associated with the overhauling, rebuilding and testing of vehicles; disposal, maintenance and storage of various military ordnance; and warehousing operations. These operations consisted of cleaning, stripping, painting, lubrication, and plating activities, which involved the use of solvents, blast media (such as sand from sandblasting operations), paints, chemicals, petroleum products, and metals. Storage, spills, releases, and disposal of these materials contaminated soil, groundwater, sediment and surface water with hazardous chemicals. Cleanups are complete at some areas within the SE Area. Operation and maintenance activities at those areas are ongoing. Investigations and remedy selection activities are ongoing at the remaining areas.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

This site is being addressed through federal actions. A February 1989 Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) between EPA, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) and the U.S. Army identified areas for investigation and possible cleanup. The FFA provided the framework and a schedule to accomplish this work. Currently, there are 35 operable units (“OUs”) being addressed under the Superfund program.

A list of the decision documents, including RODs, completed with a summary of the remedy can be found in the Operable Units section. Some OUs are grouped together and covered under one ROD, resulting in nineteen RODs for Letterkenny SE.

A full list of operable units can be viewed under the *Operable Units* section.

The site is being addressed by the U.S. Department of Defense under the Installation Restoration Program and Base Closure.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The U.S. Army has the lead role for cleaning up the Letterkenny Army Depot SE.

Per the Federal Facilities Agreement between EPA, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the U.S. Army, a Site Management Plan (SMP) is annually updated with activities at each operable unit and area of concern.

Cleanup work is ongoing at several operable units. Current work at Letterkenny SE includes work in OUs 3, 5, 6, 9 and 11.

A full list of activities per each operable unit can be found under the *Cleanup Progress* section.

The lead agency conducts five-year reviews for remedies implemented. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent can be found here, hyperlink [2017 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2243725). EPA is in the process of reviewing the 2022 Five-Year Review report.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Letterkenny SE is an active U.S. Army installation, and many OUs are not accessible to the public. To further protect human health by limiting exposures, the Army has implemented various Land Use Controls (LUCs) via deed restrictions, local ordinances, and on-base physical controls. These LUCs include prohibitions on excavations, use of groundwater for drinking or other purposes, vegetative caps, and fencing to prevent access.
