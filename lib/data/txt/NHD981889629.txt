### Background

The former Mohawk Tannery facility (a.k.a. Granite State Leathers) is located on approximately 30-acres in Nashua, Hillsborough County, New Hampshire. The currently inactive facility produced tanned hides for leather between 1924 and 1984. The Site was proposed to the National Priorities List (NPL) on the basis of past disposal practices which included the direct discharge of wastewater containing hazardous substances such as chromium, zinc, and phenol into the Nashua River and the disposal of sludge containing hazardous substances such as chromium, pentachlorophenol, phenol, and 2,4,6-trichloropehenol into a number of unlined disposal areas at the Site. Two of the largest disposal areas are located directly next to the Nashua River; with one of these areas within the 100-year flood plain. These disposal areas were not designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to prevent the washout of hazardous substances in the event of a flood. The confluence of the Nashua and the Merrimack Rivers is located approximately 3.5 miles downstream of the Site. Both the Nashua River and the Merrimack River are fished extensively, and wetlands are located along both rivers. Approximately 5,025 people receive drinking water from ground water wells within a 4-mile radius of the Site. However, a majority of the people living near the Site are being supplied with potable water through the local water district.

The Site is comprised by two contiguous, approximately 15-acre parcels of land: a developed "northern parcel" that was historically used for tannery and waste disposal operations, and a "southern parcel" that is undeveloped and does not appear to have been used by the former tannery.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Public health and environmental concerns have been addressed in the past by several federal, state, and local actions. In 2000, EPA Region 1 proposed the Site to the National Priorities List (NPL). In August 2000, EPA issued an [Action Memorandum](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/270138) to:

- Remove and dispose of asbestos-containing material from the old tannery building
- Characterize and dispose of contamination contained in drums and tanks on site; and dispose of these at an off-site facility.

This work was completed in January 2001. Removing asbestos-containing material and drums/containers from the site reduced the potential for exposure to hazardous substances.

Efforts by EPA (and the property owner) to further secure the Site have also reduced the potential for exposure to hazardous substances. To further secure the site, EPA repaired several gates and posted warning signs about the dangers of trespassing. The property owner maintains these gates and fences under a 2006 agreement with EPA and the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES).

In 2002, EPA proposed a [non-time-critical removal action](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/35785) for the Site’s sludge disposal areas. EPA developed cleanup options for the six waste disposal areas at the site and identified the Agency’s recommended cleanup approach. However, at the request of the City of Nashua, EPA did not move forward with the final NPL listing and the proposed NTCRA was put on hold. The City of Nashua believed there may be a viable developer that could possibly clean up the site, therefore requested that EPA not move forward with the non-time creitcal removal action was put on hold. The City of Nashua believed there may be a viable developer that could possibly clean up the site, therefore requested that EPA not move forward with the non-time critical removal action.

In 2018, EPA completed an [amendment](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/01/627479.pdf) to the 2002 environmental engineering/cost analysis. The amendment re-evaluates alternatives considered in 2002 and other possible removal actions, and it recommends the on-site encapsulation and impermeable capping of the wastes as the preferred alternative.

In September 2019, EPA issued an [Action Memorandum](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/640123) for the non-time critical removal action, which included the excavation, consolidation, and encapsulation of the sludge and contaminated soils at the Mohawk Tannery Site. In December 2020, EPA finalized an  [addendum](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/100016016) to the Action Memo to include the adjacent Fimbel Landfill and City Right of Way as part of the overall cleanup plan.

In December 2020, EPA reached an agreement with Blaylock that will ensure the successful remediation and beneficial reuse of the Site. This agreement is unique in that the cleanup costs are being shared with the developer, who will be reimbursed by EPA for part of the project cost. The agreement was developed in coordination with the City of Nashua and the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. The cleanup work addresses hazardous substances in soils, sludges, and contaminated waste to eliminate the threat posed to human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The removal design is underway. The removal action calls for removal of approximately 56,000 cubic yards of contaminated sludge, soils, and/or asbestos-containing material from the following properties: Mohawk Tannery, Fimbel Door, and City Right-of-Way (ROW). These materials will be consolidated and encapsulated with an impermeable cap in the area of the Mohawk Tannery Site where approximately 68,150 cubic yards of contaminated sludge and overlying soil is present.

The sludge containment structure will be built with a vertical barrier that will surround the former tannery lagoons (Area 1 and Area 2). The sludge containment structure will be covered by an impermeable cap. An asbestos-impacted material consolidation cell will also be constructed and covered with a marker barrier and two feet of clean fill.

The vertical containment structure and cap will be designed to withstand a 500-year flood event. Mitigation structures (e.g. drainage swales, detention areas etc.) will be built on Site to compensate for the flood storage loss that may result from a 100-year flood event.

Blaylock plans to submit the 100% Removal Design in March 2025, with the cleanup beginning in Summer 2025. The cleanup work is expected to take approximately 12 to 18 months.

EPA will continue to work closely with state and local officials as the project progresses. EPA, NHDES, and Blaylock plan to hold public informational meetings throughout the construction planning and removal process.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Numerous environmental investigations and removal/pre-remedial activities have been completed at the Site in association with tannery-related wastes, and soil and groundwater contamination, from 1985 to the present. Please refer to the Administrative Record for a list of these investigations and how to obtain copies of them.

### Green Remediation

The EE/CA Amendment screening process for all the cleanup alternatives considered short term and long term environmental impacts. The preferred alternative offers the best possible approach to minimize those.
