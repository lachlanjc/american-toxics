### Background

The 23-acre Ralph Gray Trucking Co. site is located in Westminster, California. Former agricultural activities and improper waste disposal practices at the site contaminated surface seep material and buried waste with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), sulfur and organic sulfur compounds, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). A development company removed the hazardous waste before building a neighborhood on the site, but wastes continued to seep from the ground until cleanup began. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund programâ€™s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2004.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Between 1987 and 1991, California Department of Health Services (DHS) removed seep annually and issued health advisories to residents. Cleanup began in 1992 and consisted of a removal action, or short-term cleanup, to excavate surface waste seeps and buried wastes. During the removal action, a contractor removed 45,000 cubic yards of hazardous substances from the site and conducted landscaping and built improvements. The contractor replaced excavated areas with clean backfill. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation administered a temporary relocation program for affected residents.

Post-cleanup sampling indicated that contamination at the site did not pose a risk to human health and the environment. EPA believes it has found and removed all significant sources of hazardous waste from the site. However, excavation of deeper soils may unearth small pockets of waste material.  

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2004.
