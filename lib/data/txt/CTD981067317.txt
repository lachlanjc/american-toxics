### Background

The 15-acre Cheshire Ground Water Contamination site is located in Cheshire, Connecticut. The site consists of a plume of contaminated groundwater; several tenants have conducted various manufacturing processes on site.

The 15-acre area has been leased by several manufacturing tenants. A major part of the site was owned by Cheshire Associates, a New York-based partnership, from 1966 to 1984. The Lembo-Feinerman Cheshire Trust is now the property owner. The company leased the site property to Valley National Corporation from 1966 to 1979 and to Cheshire Molding Co. from 1979 to 1980. Both companies made plastic molding at the site; neither kept records of disposal practices or waste quantities. Airpax Corporation Plant 2, which made electromechanical and electronic devices, leased the property from 1983 to 1995 and disposed of its wastes in accordance with state regulations. The wastes of principal concern at the site include organic chemicals and solvents.

After a successful cleanup, which included removing soil and providing municipal water to residents, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1997.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through state actions. In October 1983, past landowners Cheshire Associates removed 20 cubic yards of contaminated soil. In addition, municipal water supplies were provided to residences that had contaminated wells. An EPA investigation in 1996 concluded that there were low levels of contamination at the site and that these levels did not pose an unacceptable threat to public health or the environment. After this report, EPA proposed that no further cleanup was needed.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In October 1983, past landowners Cheshire Associates removed 20 cubic yards of contaminated soil. In addition, municipal water supplies were provided to residences with contaminated wells.

The site was deleted from the National Priorities List in 1997. Low levels of contamination are present at the site, but these levels do not pose an unacceptable threat to public health and the environment.  

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional Controls are not required for this site.**

This site does not require ICs which means there is no contamination remaining at the site that could result in an unacceptable exposure and/or remedy components at the site that could be damaged. For additional information on this site, the site contacts should be consulted.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits, and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left on-site and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remain on-site (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
