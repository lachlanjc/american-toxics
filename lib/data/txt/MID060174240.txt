### Background

The Ott/Story/Cordova Chemical Co. site is located in Muskegon, Michigan. Formerly, the site was an organic chemical production facility that operated under at least three owners from 1957 to 1985. The former production area is about 20 acres in size. Wastewater and production vessel residue disposal practices contaminated groundwater, soils and nearby Little Bear Creek and its unnamed tributary. About 10,000 drums of waste material, some of which contained phosgene gas, were also stockpiled on site. Following cleanup, operations and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s long-term remedy included groundwater treatment, excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil and sediment, and treatment of additional contaminated soil and sediment. The groundwater treatment facility started operating in 2000.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires attainment of groundwater cleanup goals, additional actions to address contamination in deep aquifers, and compliance with effective institutional controls.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Under EPA oversight, the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes & Energy continues to operate and maintain the groundwater extraction and treatment system. EPA, in partnership with EGLE, will replace or install several extraction wells and other components related to the extraction system in 2021 and 2022. In addition, EPA is evaluating supplemental remedial alternatives to treat the contamination in the source area that continues to dissolve into groundwater, which will speed up groundwater cleanup. EPA anticipates proposing and selecting a remedial alternative for source area treatment in 2021.

EPA is also conducting the sixth five-year review of the site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. The State of Michigan and former site owner Cordova Chemical Co. did a partial removal between 1977 and 1979. By that time, contaminated groundwater had migrated a mile to the southeast, contaminating the Creek and several private wells. Residents received bottled water until the 1982 installation of a public water system.  

### Enforcement Information

U.S. EPA issued Special Notice letters to PRPs on October 15, 1982, August 2, 1985, and May 9, 1989. However, no PRPs have been identified with ongoing liability for the site and EPA and the State of Michigan are responsible Site cleanup.
