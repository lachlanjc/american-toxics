Background
The PCE/TCE Northeast Contamination Site is in York, York County, Nebraska. The site is near several industrial facilities/businesses, and the associated groundwater contaminant plume extends to the east/southeast through residential areas. Previous investigations in the area have documented releases of trichloroethene (TCE), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA), 1,1-dichloroethene (DCE), tetrachloroethene (PCE) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) to groundwater in the northeastern York area. Groundwater contamination has been an ongoing issue since sampling by the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (NDHHS) in March 1990 discovered volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in some of York's municipal wells. In 1991, the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality conducted an investigation of the site. Based on the results of the investigation, the EPA provided bottled water to a number of affected residents under removal authority. In 1993 and 1994, Argonne National Laboratory began investigating the former Commodity Credit Corporation/USDA grain bin storage site, located northwest of the industrial facilities/businesses. The former USDA grain bin storage site, source area and associated groundwater contaminant plume, is currently being addressed in the state voluntary cleanup program. In 1995, the EPA conducted an Expanded Site Inspection (ESI) of the site. The ESI included questionnaires regarding chemicals used at the industrial facilities of interest along with field investigation activities. Soil samples were collected and field screened from nine facilities. Samples were also collected from 13 public water supply wells. No VOCs were detected in the public water supply wells. In 2010, the NDEQ conducted an investigation of the site. The investigation documented PCE and TCE exceeding drinking water standards in a number of private drinking water wells. Based on these results, the EPA began a removal action to continue sampling private drinking water wells and where necessary, provided an alternate water source or installation of a whole-house drinking water filtration system. The site was proposed for the National Priorities List in December 2013 and became final on the NPL in May 2014.  In November 2016, the EPA and Kroy Industries, Inc. entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent to conduct a Focused Investigation. The investigation activities conducted in 2017 and 2018 included geologic logging via electrical conductivity, hydraulic profile tool and membrane interface probe and groundwater and soil sampling within the study area to further characterize the site and prepare an updated conceptual site model. In May 2019, the EPA, Kroy Industries, Inc. and Kroy Building Products, Inc. entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent to conduct a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study. In 2020, remedial investigation activities will begin, which will include the collection of additional soil, soil gas and groundwater samples to further characterize the potential source area(s) and the groundwater contaminant plume. Remedial investigation activities were halted in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they were resumed in August 2020.  In 2022, the groundwater monitoring well network was installed, and routine groundwater sampling began to establish a consistent monitoring record and to monitor the groundwater contaminant plume. In 2023, routine groundwater samples were collected from the monitoring well network installed in 2022. Groundwater analytical results were incorporated into the remedial investigation report.  
The EPA received the Remedial Investigation Report, the Human Health and Ecological Risk Assessment, and Candidate Technologies Memorandum (for a treatability study under the existing Administrative Settlement and Administrative Order on Consent - ASAOC) in November 2023. The EPA provided comments to the respondent on each document in March and June 2024. The respondents provided a response to the EPA comments in August 2024. The responses to EPA comments adequately addressed the initial comments and approval of each document was provided subject to submission of revised documents. The EPA received the revised/final documents on January 31, 2025. The respondents are coordinating a groundwater monitoring event for targeted private wells and Site monitoring wells. Private well sampling access agreements are being prepared/negotiated. The scope and schedule for the groundwater sampling event will be provided to USEPA under separate cover during the first half of 2025. The up-to-date sampling data will further inform the development of a Treatability Study under the existing ASAOC.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Under EPA Removal authority, private drinking water wells are sampled on a routine basis. Periodic private well sampling activities are ongoing to verify that exposure does not pose a risk to human health. The respondent is preparing a work plan for a Treatability Study under the ASAOC enforcement document authority (Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study – EPA Docket No. CERCLA-07-2019-0204, 2019).

What Is the Current Site Status?
The EPA continues an ongoing removal action which consists of periodic private well sampling to ensure any current and future potential exposures to site contaminants of concern are addressed. As necessary, the EPA will install whole-house drinking water filtration systems or provide connection to the public drinking water supply. The Removal Action is scheduled to be closed by 09/30/2025 with the development of a Final PolRep report (to be developed and submitted by the site's EPA Remedial Project Manager).  In May 2019, the EPA, Kroy Industries, Inc. and Kroy Building Products, Inc. entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent to conduct a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study. In 2020, remedial investigation activities will begin, which will include the collection of additional soil, soil gas and groundwater samples to further characterize the potential source area(s) and the groundwater contaminant plume.
