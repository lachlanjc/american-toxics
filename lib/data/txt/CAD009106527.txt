### Background

The McCormick & Baxter Creosoting Co. site is a 29-acre former wood preserving facility at 1214 West Washington Ave. in Stockton, California. Utility pole and railroad tie treatment activities from 1942 to 1990 contaminated soil and groundwater with pentachlorophenol (PCP), dioxin, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs). Following construction of the site’s soil, sediment and surface water remedy, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing. EPA is working on a final groundwater cleanup remedy for the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The former wood preserving facility is located in an industrial area near the Port of Stockton. Except for an 8-acre area owned by Southern Pacific Railroad Company, McCormick & Baxter owns the entire site property. From 1942 to 1990, McCormick & Baxter treated utility poles and railroad ties with creosote, PCP and compounds of arsenic, chromium and copper. The company stored wood-treating chemicals in tanks, and oily waste generated by wood-treatment processes in unlined ponds and concrete tanks. A fish kill in 1997 alerted state agencies to a release of PCP-contaminated stormwater runoff from the McCormick & Baxter facility. In 1978, McCormick & Baxter constructed a perimeter dike to prevent stormwater runoff from the site and installed two stormwater collection ponds. The unlined oily waste ponds closed in 1981.

EPA is addressing the site in two stages: initial actions and comprehensive cleanup focused on groundwater, soils and surface water/sediment.

Initial Actions: EPA completed demolition of all site treatment vessels, structures and aboveground tanks and piping in 1994. From 1996 to 1997, EPA installed a piling wall along the shoreline of Old Mormon Slough to control seepages from the former oily waste ponds, excavated about 12,000 cubic yards of oily waste and backfilled the area with clean fill. EPA contained the excavated material on site in a lined repository. A cap on the central part of the site prevents infiltration and controls dust mitigation.

Groundwater: EPA selected an interim remedy in 1997 that included groundwater pumping and treatment. However, because evidence shows the groundwater plume is not showing any significant movment, EPA never implemented the remedy. In addition, there is evidence that the contaminants are breaking down at the plume’s edges. Investigations into the extent of the contamination will continue until EPA has enough information to propose a final groundwater cleanup plan.

Soils: The long-term soil remedy included excavation and containment of contaminated soils, backfilling of the area with clean fill, installation of a cap over the contained contaminated soils, and cap maintenance and institutional controls. Construction activities finished in 2011. Institutional controls limit site access, protect the remedies and prevent certain land uses.

Surface Water/Sediment: The long-term remedy included bank stabilization and placement of a sand cap over the contaminated sediment with ongoing monitoring. Bank stabilization and construction of the pre-capping remedy began in 2002. Capping work finished in 2006. EPA permanently removed vessels from the Old Morman Slough in 2007.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. The most recent review can be found [here](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/09/100034741.pdf). These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires evaluation of the need for institutional controls and ongoing operation and maintenance activities, including groundwater monitoring.
