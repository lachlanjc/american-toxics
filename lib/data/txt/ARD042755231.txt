### Background

**Background**

The Ouachita-Nevada Wood Treaters (ONWT) Superfund Site is located in Ouachita County, Arkansas. The ONWT site is a former wood-treating facility located on approximately 5 acres of land along North Main Street in Reader, Ouachita County, Arkansas. The site is about 3 miles northwest of Bluff City, Nevada County, Arkansas, and 3 miles northwest of Chidester, Ouachita County, Arkansas.  
  
The ONWT site was in operation from 1946 to 1987. The facility began operations as a sawmill in 1946. In 1956, the facility began treating wood using pentachlorophenol (PCP). The three impoundments at the site were originally constructed for emergency containment in case of a release. The treatment system operated by heating the oil, adding PCP, and then vacuum treating the wood. In 1972, the operator began using a chromium/copper solution. However, the chromium/copper solution failed to effectively protect the wood products and the process was abandoned. Following abandonment of chromium/copper wood treatment process, a mixture of diesel fuel and motor oil called “black oil” was used to treat the wood. This treating process also failed to adequately preserve the wood products.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions. EPA completed the first five-year review for the site in September 2011. It concluded that the selected remedy is currently performing as intended. The remedy is considered protective because there is no evidence of groundwater use near the site and thus no current exposure. Recommendations and follow-up actions from the Five-Year Review report are being addressed or continued to ensure long-term protectiveness of human health and the environment until remedial action objectives are met.  
  
Removal of contaminated on-site soils, abandoned drums and surface impoundments has significantly reduced the potential for contamination to migrate from the site into the intermittent stream and off-site wetlands. Once remedial action goals are achieved, groundwater will be suitable for use by a future resident.

On March 21, 2000, EPA began a time-critical removal action at the Site. The removal action addressed all aboveground sources of contamination, including tanks, drums, and impoundments, as well as all soil exceeding the 50 mg/kg action level for either arsenic or pentachlorophenol. Approximately 4,065 tons of contaminated soil were excavated and disposed of. The removal action was completed on June 24, 2000.  
  
EPA signed a Record of Decision (ROD) for the Site on September 28, 2005. The ROD, which sets forth the selected remedy for the Site, involves actions to address pentachlorophenol (PCP) contamination in groundwater. The major components of the remedy are:  
  
Recovery and Disposal of Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (LNAPL): Wells will be installed within the source area for the recovery of LNAPL. The recovered LNAPL will require off-site disposal. Any contaminated ground water recovered during the LNAPL recovery process will require on-site treatment or off-site disposal  
  
In-Situ Enhanced Bioremediation: Once LNAPL recovery operations stop, new or existing wells will be used for injection of bionutrients. Batch treatments of nutrient-containing amendment will be injected into the plume to enhance the naturally occurring biodegradation of pentachlorophenol.  
  
Installation of a Slurry Wall: A slurry wall will be installed along the western property boundary to prevent contaminant flow and dispersion to off-site areas to the west of the site. The wall would begin at the southwestern corner of the property and run northward along the property boundary. The exact length of the slurry wall will be determined in the remedial design.  
  
Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA): MNA will include sampling of monitoring wells and evaluation of the ground water plume to monitor migration of the plume and ensure natural biodegradation processes are occurring. Wells will be selected during the design phase for quarterly monitoring to evaluate decay rates and demonstrate plume stability.  
  
Placement of an Institutional Control: In order to further protect human health and prevent future ground water use from the shallow aquifer on site, EPA will implement institutional controls (ICs) at the site. EPA will negotiate a Consent Decree with the current landowner that would include a restriction on the installation of wells for the purposes of withdrawing water from the shallow aquifer. Under the Consent Decree, EPA would require the landowner to execute and record an easement running with the land that would grant right of access for activities related to implementing this ROD. Also, a deed notification will be filed with the appropriate land records office. During the performance of routine ground water monitoring activities at the Site, a Site evaluation will be conducted to ensure that there is no use of the contaminated ground water.  
  
EPA’s remedial action contractor completed construction of the remedial action in September 2006. During construction, a slurry wall was installed to prevent ground water contamination from moving to off-site areas west of the site. Also, a system was installed to recover light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) that is present in the ground water.On March 21, 2000, EPA began a time-critical removal action at the Site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA completed the second five-year review for the site in August 2016. The review concluded that the selected remedy protective because there is no evidence of groundwater use near the site and thus no current exposure. Recommendations and follow-up actions from the five-year review report are being addressed or continued to ensure long-term protectiveness of human health and the environment until remedial action objectives are met.
