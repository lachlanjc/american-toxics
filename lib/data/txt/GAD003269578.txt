### Background

The Woolfolk Chemical Works, Incorporated [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in Fort Valley, Georgia. Southern Railroad tracks and a station are located in the northwest portion of the site. Commercial businesses and residential areas border the site. Residences are located west, south and east of the site. Commercial businesses and light industrial areas are located north, northwest and east of the site.

Beginning in 1910 various companies used the Woolfolk Chemical Works facility for herbicide and pesticide production, packaging and storage. Production expanded after 1945 to include various organic pesticides. The earliest documented complaint associated with the site occurred in 1966 when a Georgia Water Quality Inspector investigated the site based on reports from local citizens that the facility discharged waste products to a ditch, which flowed into a nearby creek.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1990 because of contaminated groundwater and soils resulting from facility operations.

Currently, Peach County Public Library, a welcome center and an adult education center are located on portions of the site. The City of Fort Valley plans to reuse remaining portions of the site.

EPA, the [Georgia Environmental Protection Division (Georgia EPD)](https://epd.georgia.gov/) and one of the site’s former [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) have investigated site conditions. By continuing to clean up and monitor the site and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA and Georgia EPD continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

While cleanup actions have addressed contamination in the soil, sediments and the attic dust of nearby residences, groundwater contamination remains at the site. Groundwater contamination has been reported on and off-site and has impacted some private wells. The extent of groundwater contamination is unknown and is currently being investigated

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA identified several site PRPs. However, only one PRP actively conducted any cleanup. This PRP initially led site investigation and cleanup activities for contaminated groundwater and contaminated soil on off-site properties designated for redevelopment. EPA and Georgia EPD provided oversight.

**1986 - 1987**  
EPA began investigating the release or potential release of hazardous substances at the site. During that same year, one of the site's PRPs initiated a cleanup that removed much of the contaminated soils and installed series of monitoring wells to study ground water contamination. Included in the cleanup was the demolition of a building heavily contaminated with arsenic and construction of a cap over the contaminated soils and building debris generated during the cleanup. However, the action did not address dioxin for which appropriate disposal technologies had not been developed and contamination above health-based levels remained in the soils, sediments, structures, offsite soils, and nearby residences.

**1993 to 1997**  
The PRP removed contaminated soil and waste from 26 residential properties and the drainage corridor, cleaned up contaminated attic dust, and demolished a contaminated building.

The PRP purchased 17 residential properties, demolished the properties, and converted the area into a public library, an adult education center and a welcome center.

**1998**  
The PRP completed redevelopment construction and installation of a groundwater pump-and-treat system in 1998. The PRP operated the system until 2003 when it ceased operation, citing lack of funds.

**2008**

The EPA restarted the groundwater treatment system (GWTS) in 2008. However, the 2014 five year review determined the GWTS was not functioning as intended and was pumping an inadequate volume to contain the plume. The GWTS was shut down in 2014 and has remained non-operational.

**2015**

Groundwater samples were collected to investigate and to determine the extent of the groundwater contamination.

**2016**

Groundwater samples were collected to investigate and to determine the extent of the groundwater contamination.

**2017**

Groundwater samples were collected to investigate and to determine the extent of the groundwater contamination.

**2018**

Groundwater samples were collected to investigate and to determine the extent of the groundwater contamination.

**2019**

Groundwater samples were collected to investigate and to determine the extent of the groundwater contamination.

**2020**

Groundwater samples were collected to investigate and to determine the extent of the groundwater contamination.

**2022**

Groundwater samples were collected to investigate and to determine the extent of the groundwater contamination.

**2023**

Groundwater samples were collected to investigate and to determine the extent of the groundwater contamination.

Two separate vapor sampling events were collected from nearby residences to determine if contaminants entered the residences in the form of gas (or vapor) that can move from groundwater through the soil and work its way into buildings through cracks or openings in your home’s foundation. This process is called “vapor intrusion.” The results from both sampling events determined that, at this time, there was no immediat threat to the health of the residents.

**2023 - 2024**

The EPA installed 36 wells in four separate water bearing zones downgradient of the Site, some as deep as approximately 400 feet. These wells will be utilized to delineate the large groundwater plume extending from the Site, identify potential additional sources of contamination, and may also be used during future cleanup efforts. Groundwater sampling at the newly installed wells are proposed for January 2025. Results from this sampling effort will help develop a better understanding of the extent of the groundwater contamination.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Since 2009, EPA has continued cleaning up on-site contamination in soil, the capped area, buildings and the stormwater sewer system. These activities include digging up additional contaminated soil, stabilizing and consolidating the soil on site or disposing of it off site, and capping the area of disposal.

EPA continues to operate the site’s groundwater pump-and-treat system. EPA is evaluating options to improve the effectiveness of the system.

EPA is conducting a remedial investigation for contamination associated with the drainage ditch from the Spiller Street pipe past the railroad to Big Indian Creek. Following completion of the remedial investigation, EPA will evaluate cleanup options. EPA will discuss the cleanup options in detail in the feasibility study and summarize them in a proposed cleanup plan, which will be offered for public comment. EPA will document the selected remedy and the Agency’s justification for its selection in a final cleanup plan called a Record of Decision (ROD).

EPA completed the [most recent Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11201032.pdf) in 2024 and found that the remedy at OU2, OU3, and OU4 currently protects human health and the environment. However, a protectiveness determination cannot be made for OU1 at this time until further information is obtained. It is expected that groundwater investigations will take approximately 2.5 years, at which time a protectiveness determination will be made.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA negotiated an agreement with one of the site’s PRPs to investigate and clean up the site. This PRP and the other PRPs were also required to contribute towards the costs of the cleanup by court order. In 1998, the EPA took the lead at the site using federal funds for the cleanup. In addition, the EPA used $1.8 million in funding available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to fund cleanup activities at the site.
