### Background

The Detroit Steel Corp. McLouth Steel Gibraltar Plant is at 28000 W. Jefferson Ave., Gibraltar, Michigan, west of the Canadian National North American rail line. Catch basins there receive wastewater from adjacent landfills.

McLouth Steel Products Co. owned and operated the steel finishing operations from the early 1950s to 1996 in an area that was historically industrial. Processes included annealing, pickling, and cold rolling processes. DSC acquired the company as a result of bankruptcy. In 1997, DSC started an environmental investigation of the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

A remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) at the DSC McLouth Gibraltar site began in 2016. Multi-media data collection is ongoing to evaluate the nature and extent of contamination at the site, and to support a risk assessment. It is anticipated that the RI/FS report for OU2 (Countywide Landfill \[CWL\]) will be completed by 2023, while OU1 (Landfills A and B) and OU3 (groundwater) will be completed by 2026.

This site is one of many across the country to receive funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which invested $3.5 billion in environmental remediation at Superfund sites on the National Priorities List. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding will be used to implement remedial actions at the site, including the pumping and hauling of landfill leachate off-site from Landfills A and B, preventing outbreaks and impacts to the local drainage systems.

Leachate from Countywide Landfill is currently hauled off-site under Michigan Department of Environment, Great lanes, and Energy (EGLE) oversight. ELGE plans to construct an on-site treatment building at Countywide Landfill for long term leachate management. It is anticipated that construction of the treatment building will begin in 2024.
