### Background

The Smithtown Ground Water Contamination site is located in the villages of Nissequogue and Head of the Harbor, and the hamlet of St. James, on Long Island in eastern New York state. The site consists of an area of contaminated groundwater that has affected local drinking water supplies. Groundwater is contaminated with perchloroethylene (PCE), a solvent used in dry cleaning and metal cleaning. EPA connected affected residents to public water supplies and provided bottled water. EPA conducts long-term groundwater and surface water monitoring. Controls are in place to restrict the use of groundwater.

On October 9, 1997, EPA received a written request from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) requesting assistance in funding alternative water supplies for residences affected by contaminated groundwater. Attached to NYSDEC's request for assistance was a private well sampling survey, prepared by the Suffolk County Department of Health Services (SCDHS), which presented drinking water results from 35 private wells in the area. Analytical data from this survey indicated that several wells were contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), primarily PCE.

After immediate actions to protect human health and the environment in 1998, and site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in January 1999.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Immediate Actions: In 1998, EPA started supplying bottled water to residences with contaminated wells. These actions were taken to protect the health of the public until a more permanent solution could be put in place. In the fall and winter of 1998-99, EPA took further action. Where a public water supply was available, affected residences were connected. This included installing a service line from the water company’s distribution system at the property line to each house and disconnecting the well. At homes where water mains were not available, EPA installed individual carbon treatment systems or upgraded existing household treatment systems to EPA specifications.  

Long-term Cleanup: EPA conducted a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine the nature and extent of the contamination at the site and develop remedial alternatives to address the contamination. EPA observed sporadic and isolated pockets of contamination and no contiguous groundwater plume was detected. The remedial investigation was not able to determine the source(s) of the groundwater contamination. EPA selected the site’s long-term remedy in the site’s September 2004 Record of Decision. It included providing alternate water supplies to homes affected by the contamination, long-term groundwater and surface water monitoring, and institutional controls to restrict use of contaminated groundwater.

Affected residences have been connected to the public water supply.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in two phases: immediate actions to provide alternate water supplies and a long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.

In the 2004 Record of Decision (ROD), EPA selected a remedy of providing an alternate water supply to homes currently and potentially impacted by groundwater contaminated by VOCs. The work to connect residences within the area designated in the ROD to water mains began in November 2005. All residences, that accepted EPA's offer, were connected to the public water supply. Construction at the site was completed by the end of September 2006.

At this site, long-term monitoring program included groundwater sampling from a network of monitoring wells to monitor contaminant concentrations and migration overtime. In addition, five-year reviews for the site were performed from 2011 through 2020 to ensure that the cleanup was functioning properly. EPA determined after a third five-year review in November 2020 that the actions at the site protect people’s health and the environment. Furthermore, the results of the long-term monitoring of groundwater and surface water demonstrated that the groundwater aquifer has been restored to meet state and federal drinking water standards. As a result, no additional five-year reviews will be required.
