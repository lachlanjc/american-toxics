Background
The North Penn Area 6 Site is located within the North Penn Water Authority (NPWA) service district in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Five other National Priorities List (NPL) Sites (North Penn Areas 1, 2, 5, 7, and 12) and a state Superfund Site (North Penn Area 4) have also been identified in the NPWA area.  This Site is in the Borough of Lansdale and small portions of Hatfield, Towamencin, and Upper Gwynedd townships. The preliminary boundaries of the Site were determined based on groundwater quality data. In 1979, high levels of trichloroethene were detected in several wells within the Lansdale area. This discovery led to the addition of the Site to the National Priorities List in 1989. The Site is situated over a large area with commercial, industrial, and residential uses.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The Site is being addressed through federal, state, and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. Cleanup of the Site is divided into three Operable Units, as described below: Operable Unit 1 (OU1) – Twenty-Six (26) properties were initially identified by EPA as potential sources of contamination at the Site. Beginning in 1993, EPA evaluated 20 of the properties as part of the OU1 Source Control OU. Based on the OU1 Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS), EPA determined that soil contamination at four of the properties may have contributed to groundwater contamination and required remedial action. In September 1995, EPA issued the OU1 Record of Decision (ROD), which required soil remediation at the four properties. Cleanup activities associated with the OU1 soil remedy have been completed. Operable Unit 2 (OU2) - OU2 consists of six properties identified initially as having contributed to soil contamination at the Site, but which were not addressed in the OU1 effort. Under OU2, the owners or operators of these six properties conducted soil investigations in accordance with an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) for the RI/FS under EPA oversight. The potentially responsible parties at four of the properties have completed the work required at their respective properties under the RI/FS AOC. Investigations for soil contamination are ongoing at the remaining two properties. Operable Unit 3 (OU3) - The groundwater at the Site is being addressed as OU3. EPA completed the RI/FS for OU3 in 1999 and issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for OU3 in 2000. The remedy set forth in the OU3 ROD consists of groundwater extraction and treatment, monitoring of residential wells, and long-term monitoring of the groundwater. Currently, nine properties have been selected for installation of groundwater extraction and treatment systems, including the Property. EPA is responsible for implementing the remedy at five of the nine properties, and the remedy at the remaining four properties is being implemented by the respective responsible parties. To date, EPA has installed groundwater extraction and treatment systems at five of the properties. The respective responsible parties constructed and are currently operating treatment systems at two properties and remedial design activities are underway to install systems at two additional properties. EPA transitioned operation and maintenance of the treatment systems at four of the properties to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) in 2014 and 2017.   While a comprehensive VI investigation concluded in 2019, groundwater data at the Site is limited. It may be necessary to reevaluate the Site when additional wells are installed and additional samples are collected. On May 20, 2020, an Explanation of Significant Difference (ESD) was issued. An ESD outlines changes to the original cleanup plan to protect human health and the environment. This ESD modified the Operable Unit 3 remedy by removing the requirement to install a groundwater extraction and treatment system at the Ninth and Moyers source location. In early 2017 the sSite team began an evaluation of existing groundwater data to determine if a vapor intrusion (VI) investigation was warranted. After reviewing the groundwater data the sSite team determined that several of the properties at the sSite had elevated volatile organic compound concentrations in shallow groundwater which could lead to unacceptable risk associated with VI. In March 2019, a VI Study was conducted at several residences and businesses adjacent to sSite properties. An evaluation of the sampling result determined that there is no unacceptable risk associated with VI at the Site.

What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA continues to oversee the cleanup of the North Penn Area 6 Superfund Site. Operable Unit 1 (OU1) – In September 1995, EPA issued the OU1 Record of Decision (ROD), which required soil remediation at four properties. The OU1 remedial action was completed in 2004. Operable Unit 2 (OU2) - The potentially responsible parties at four properties have completed the work required at their respective properties under the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study Administrative Order on Consent (RI/FS AOC). Investigations for soil contamination are ongoing at the remaining two properties. Operable Unit 3 (OU3) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announces its intent to partially delete a portion of the North Penn Area 6 Superfund Site – Operable Unit 3. EPA has installed groundwater extraction and treatment systems at five properties at OU3. The respective responsible parties constructed and are currently operating treatment systems at two properties and remedial design activities are underway to install systems at two additional properties. The need for groundwater treatment is being reassessed at one additional property. On December 23, 2016, a direct final notice of partial deletion for the Site was published in the Federal Register and became effective on February 21, 2017. This partial deletion removed approximately 6.5 acres of the North Penn Area 6 Superfund Site, referred to as the Administrative Parcel, from the National Priorities List. EPA, in consultation with PADEP, determined that all appropriate response actions had been performed at the Administrative Parcel and that no further cleanup was required. The current property owner plans to reuse/redevelop the Administrative Parcel into a major residential development with 174 semi-attached condominium units. EPA﻿ developed two Proposed Remedial Action Plans (Proposed Plans) for the North Penn Area 6 Superfund Site. One outlined options for addressing soil contamination at the J.W. Rex property and the other outlined options for addressing groundwater contamination at the Central Sprinkler property. On March 30, 2018, EPA issued the Proposed Plans for public comment. The public comment period remained open from March 20, 2018 to April 30, 2018. In September 2018, a Record of Decision and Record of Decision Amendment were signed for the North Penn Area 6 Superfund Site. The Record of Decision documents EPA’s cleanup plans, which address soil contamination at the J.W. Rex property. The plans include excavation, off-site disposal, and institutional controls.  The Record of Decision Amendment documents EPA’s modification to the cleanup plan for the Central Sprinkler property. The amendment includes Enhanced Reductive Dichlorination, which treats the groundwater in place by enhancing the conditions for naturally occurring microorganisms to consume the contaminants in the groundwater. This will speed up the clean up process. The remedial design for soil cleanup was completed for the Operable Unit 2 (OU2), J.W. Rex Property, in accordance with the Record of Decision issued in September 2018. EPA began the remedial action at the J.W. Rex Property in April 2022. Remedial action is the construction phase of the cleanup. The remedial action was completed in fall 2023. In May 2020, EPA issued an Explanation of Significant Difference (ESD) (PDF) for the Operable Unit 3. This ESD modified the Operable Unit 3 remedy by removing the requirement to install a groundwater extraction and treatment system at the Ninth Street and Moyers Road source location. Top of Page
