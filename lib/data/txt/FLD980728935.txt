### Background

The Brown Wood Preserving site is located two miles west of Live Oak in Suwannee County, Florida. A wood treatment facility operated at the site from 1946 to 1978. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983 because of contaminated soil, sediments, sludge and groundwater resulting from facility operations.

EPA, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. Both residents and businesses use the public water system for drinking water. After completing all cleanup activities, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1995.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The 51-acre site is located two miles west of Live Oak in Suwannee County, Florida. The county-owned site is fenced and overgrown with trees and shrubs. The site is located in a rural agricultural area. A sawmill is located west of the site and a construction company is located east of the site. Land uses in the area include homes, businesses, light industry, a mobile home complex with approximately 450 residents, a private airport and a county storage yard all located within a half-mile of the site.

- From 1946 until 1978, several different companies operated a wood treatment facility at the site. Operators used creosote and pentachlorophenol (PCP) in pressure treatment processes and discharged wastewater into an open ditch, where it flowed into a five-acre unlined pond. A three-acre uphill lagoon southwest of the site contained 3,000 cubic yards of creosote materials.
- In 1983, EPA listed the site on the NPL. EPA initially led site investigation and cleanup activities, in cooperation with FDEP. Eventually, site PRPs assumed cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and FDEP. The site’s PRPs performed initial cleanup actions at the site in 1988, treating and discharging 200,000 gallons of lagoon and pit water into a sewage treatment plant; demolishing, salvaging and removing facilities and equipment on site; digging up and solidifying 15,000 tons of contaminated sludges; and backfilling the metal extraction pit.
- Site cleanup finished in 1989. As part of the cleanup, workers cleared 6 acres of land, removed an abandoned railroad track, installed a clay liner, built containment berms around the perimeter of the land treatment area, installed a treatment area surface drainage network and run-on drainage swales, shaped the runoff retention road, placed contaminated soil in the treatment and stockpile area, and installed an irrigation system.
- EPA confirmed completion of the soil cleanup in July 1990. After the site’s cleanup met all cleanup goals, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1995.
- Currently, there is no contamination remaining on site that potentially threatens local residents or the environment.
- The site is currently vacant. There are no restrictions on future reuse possibilities for the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [final Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/10988305) is available for review.

In 1988, EPA issued the site’s long-term cleanup plan. It included removing lagoon water, treating it as necessary and discharging it to a sewage treatment plant; digging up, treating and disposing of the most severely contaminated soil and sludge off site; breaking down contaminants in remaining soils biologically in a 14-acre treatment area with a liner and an internal drainage and spray irrigation system; and covering the biological treatment area with clean soil.

- Site cleanup activities were finished in 1989.
- After meeting all site cleanup goals, the EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 1995.
- Five-Year Reviews are not required for the site.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

Although EPA initially led site investigation and cleanup activities, EPA negotiated legal agreements with site PRPs to investigate and clean up the site.
