Background
The North 25th Street Glass and Zinc Site is located on the banks of the West Fork River in Clarksburg, West Virginia. The site was used for glass manufacturing from approximately 1898 through 1989. In addition, the Clarksburg Zinc Company operated on one parcel of the property from 1911 to 1924. Harrison Warehouse Services Company currently uses the property for the storage of recycled paper for a pulp facility. Part of the property is also leased to King’s Tire Services, Inc, which sells tires and performs a variety of automobile repair services. Lead, zinc, and arsenic are present onsite due to past glass and zinc manufacturing operations. In September 2016, the site was added to EPA's National Priorities List, making it eligible for federal investigation and cleanup under the Superfund program. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The North 25th Street Glass and Zinc Site consists of four adjacent parcels of land used for glass manufacturing from approximately 1898 through 1989. In addition, the Clarksburg Zinc Company operated on one parcel of the property from 1911 to 1924. In June 1970, the four property parcels were deeded to the Fourco Glass Company. In November 1986, Fourco merged into AFG Industries, Inc, with was renamed AGC Flat Glass North America, Inc. (AGC) and was the surviving entity. AGC sold the property to Harrison Warehouse Services Company, Inc in 1988.  The site (also formerly known as Fourco Glass) was added to the EPA Superfund database in 1990 following the discovery of asbestos containing material during demolition activities on the property. The asbestos containing material was removed from the site. A Preliminary Assessment was completed by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) in 1991 for EPA, and it was determined that no further action was necessary based on the cleanup of the asbestos containing material. In 2009, EPA and WVDEP re-evaluated the site due to a potential bike trail being established along a former railroad track adjacent to the site. EPA and WVDEP determined that a Site Inspection reassessment was warranted to assess potential risk associated with the glass and zinc operations that had occurred on the property. Elevated levels of arsenic, lead and zinc were found in onsite soils and sediments of the West Fork River. In 2010, WVDEP requested EPA assistance in cleaning up an area along the proposed bike path which was found to contain elevated levels of lead, zinc, and arsenic. The EPA removal program stabilized the area and capped it with asphalt. From October 2011 through March of 2015, EPA evaluated the sediments of the West Fork River to determine whether runoff from the site has contributed to degradation of the river. The investigations showed that arsenic, lead, and zinc from the former glass and zinc operations at the site are significantly elevated in the sediments of the West Fork River adjacent to the site.

What Is the Current Site Status?
Due to the significant contamination onsite and in the nearby river, the site was added to the National Priorities List in September 2016, making it eligible for long-term investigation and cleanup. The first step of the cleanup process is a Remedial Investigation to determine the extent of contamination and to evaluate potential remedies for cleanup of the site. The first phase of EPA’s Remedial Investigation sampling began in September 2019. Samples were collected for surface soil on the site property and in the nearby residential area. Subsurface soil was sampled on the site property. Monitoring wells were also installed to learn more about groundwater flow and collect groundwater samples. Data was shared with property owners during the Winter 2021. Phase II Remedial Investigation sampling began in Summer 2021 and will continue through 2023. Top of Page
Emergency Response and Removal
The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) requested EPA assistance in cleaning up an area along the bike path which was found to contain elevated levels of lead, zinc, and arsenic.

From October 2011 through March of 2015, EPA evaluated the sediments of the West Fork River to determine whether runoff from the site has contributed to degradation of the river. The conclusion of their investigation was that arsenic, lead, and zinc from the former glass and zinc operations at the site are significantly elevated in the sediments of the West Fork River adjacent to the site.
