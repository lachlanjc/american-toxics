### Background

The Pools Prairie Superfund Site is located in Newton County, Missouri, just southeast of the city of Neosho. In the 1940s, the United States government acquired approximately 43,000 acres of agricultural and residential land in Newton County to construct a U.S. Army installation named Fort Crowder. In the 1950s, a portion of Fort Crowder was transferred to the Air Force for construction of a rocket engine manufacturing plant, known as Air Force Plant No. 65, which included the Manufacturing Plant Area (MPA), the Components Test Area (CTA), the Engine Test Area (ETA) and later the Quince Road Area (QRA).

Rocket engine production and testing activities occurred at Air Force Plant 65 from 1957 to 1968. After 1968, the Manufacturing Plant was used to manufacture, test and refurbish jet airplane engines. The plant was sold in 1980 and used as an active privately-owned facility for testing and refurbishing jet and helicopter engines. The MPA was sold again in 2018 and is currently used to manufacture tiny houses. The CTA was subsequently used for jet engine overhaul and testing activities until about 1973, later being sold in 1976 to the Water and Wastewater Technical School, Inc. The CTA has been unoccupied for a number of years. The ETA is still owned by the United States and is part of Camp Crowder, an active facility used by the Missouri Army National Guard. The QRA was also sold and temporarily used to support jet engine overhaul and manufacturing activities. The original building has subsequently been demolished and replaced with new construction used for general storage.

Chemicals associated with historical operations at Plant 65 have been detected in soil and groundwater at each of the four historical areas discussed above (CTA, ETA, MPA and QRA) and these areas represent the identified source areas for the site. Site-related contaminants consist of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE).

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through potentially responsible party actions, with oversight provided by the EPA and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.

Extensive investigations have been completed at each of the four areas (MPA, ETA, CTA, QRA) where VOCs were potentially used. Investigations have detected VOCs in soil and groundwater in the source areas, as well as groundwater and surface water downgradient. Removal action activities have been completed at three of the four source areas, with the fourth currenly undergoing a removal action.

- QRA: Removal actions consisted of soil vapor extraction conducted from 2005 to 2008.
- CTA: Multiple removal actions were conducted from 1999 to 2008, including excavation of impacted soils and use of SVE.
- ETA: Removal action activities were completed in 2009 and included excavation and dual-phase extraction.
- MPA: Removal action activities were completed in 2022 and included excavation and SVE treatment.

In addition to these activities, the city of Neosho Public Water Supply was expanded to designated areas adjacent to the city limits in 1999 â€“ 2000. A secondary expansion was completed in 2014.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

A Phase I Remedial Investigation was completed in 2016 to gain a better understanding of groundwater flow in the in the area, including the geologic conditions that affect flow. The Phase II Remedial Investigation/Feasiblity Study will further characterize the nature and extent of site-related contamination and evaluate the potential remedial alternatives for the site. Phase II fieldwork is anticipated to be completed during Summer 2024. Once fieldwork is complete, a remedial investigation report summarizing site work and a focused feasiblity study evaluating cleanup options will be completed.
