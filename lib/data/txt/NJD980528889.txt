### Background

Chemsol, Inc. operated a solvent recovery and waste reprocessing facility on a 40-acre site in Piscataway, New Jersey, from the 1950s through 1964, where they mixed, blended, and distilled solvents. Numerous accidents, fires, and explosions at the facility contaminated the soil, groundwater, and air. Due to these incidents, the Township of Piscataway ordered the facility to close, and the site has remained unused since 1964. The EPA placed the Chemsol, Inc. site on the National Priorities List in 1983.

While a group of Potentially Responsible Parties, or PRPs, completed several short-term cleanups at the site to address immediate threats to people’s health and the environment, they continue to operate a groundwater treatment system on the site under EPA oversight. These PRPs are individuals or companies that may have owned or operated the site; generated waste that was disposed of or released on the site; or may, in some way be responsible for causing or contributing to the contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

To address the contamination on and from the facility, the EPA divided the site into three Operable Units, or OUs, each of which is a subset of the larger cleanup project. For OU1, the PRPs installed a system in 1994 that pumps and treats groundwater contaminated with organic solvents from beneath the property. Organic solvents are carbon-based substances capable of dissolving or dispersing one or more other substances and can spread through groundwater. They are used in many products, such as paints, varnishes, adhesives, and cleaning agents, and in the production of dyes, plastics, inks, and pharmaceuticals. The system at the Chemsol site removes the solvents from the water and prevents contaminant plumes, which are polluted areas of groundwater that contain hazardous substances, from flowing beyond the facility boundaries. This system is still operating.

The EPA expanded the onsite cleanup under OU2 to include removing contaminated soil and sediment to eliminate, to the extent possible, sources that could continue to affect groundwater quality. The property owner had previously dug up and disposed of soil containing [polychlorinated biphenyls](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts17.pdf), or PCBs, in 1988. Under EPA oversight, the PRPs removed large quantities (about 53,000 tons) of PCB- and lead-contaminated soil, stream sediment, and other material from the site in 2001 and 2002 for disposal offsite. The PRPs backfilled areas where soil was removed with clean soil, revegetated, and restored the areas. However, because the cleanup could not remove contaminants from some areas of bedrock on the site, the project team covered those areas with clean soil and issued deed restrictions to prevent contact with soil that contain levels of contaminants that exceed residential cleanup goals established for the site. Deed restrictions also prohibit residential use of portions of the Chemsol site.

The third portion of the Chemsol cleanup, OU3, requires the PRPs to investigate and address off-property groundwater contamination, a process that is ongoing.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The existing groundwater extraction wells help keep contaminated groundwater contained to beneath the property and the groundwater treatment plant continues to reduce the level of contaminants. The PRPs, with EPA oversight, are investigating how far the contaminated groundwater moved beyond the property boundaries before these actions were taken. The EPA expects the study results and start of off-property groundwater cleanup in 2026. Homes and businesses in this area are connected to a public water supply and the EPA has established a [Classification Exception Area](https://map22.epa.gov/cimc/superfundZoom&params=0200607&15) to the north-northeast of the site, which is a defined area in which installing or using groundwater wells is prohibited.

In addition to ongoing coordination with the PRPs and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, or NJDEP, the EPA continues to conduct a formal review of the site and all systems every five years, known as a “Five Year Review”. This thorough review uses site inspections, detailed record reviews, and discussions with PRPs, their contractors, and NJDEP to ensure that the current approach protects people’s health and the environment.
