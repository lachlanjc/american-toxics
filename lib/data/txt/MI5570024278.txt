Some areas of the site are still under investigation. Clean-up is being conducted by the Air Force, with Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) providing oversight.  If you have further questions about the status of the clean-up, please review EGLE’s webpage for addition information and contacts.
