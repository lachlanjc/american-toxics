### Background

**Current Activities**

- **Operable Unit 1 (OU1) Soil, Construction Debris and Groundwater**

Remedial Action (RA) to remove conaminated soil and debris in the Source Area began in late August 2023. As of December 2023, the contractor has excavated 960 cubic yards of contaminated soil. The soil piles have been sampled and analytical data submitted to waste disposal facilities. Once the waste profiles are approved by the receiving facilities, soil and debris will be transported from the site. During excavation additional soil contamination was suspected to be present under the manufacturing building. Addition soil characterization is required to estimate the volume of contamination. The New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) and EPA are reviewing work plan to remove this additional contaminated soil. Due to this finding of additional soil contamination the completion of the RA project will be delayed. NMED's contractor is continuing to develop plans for implementation of the groundwater remedy.

- **Operable Unit 2 (OU2) Indoor Air (Vapor Intrusion)**

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with support from the NMED, issued an interim Record of Decision (ROD for addressing vapor intrusion.

The EPA and NMED will continue to provide information regarding the cleanup of the Eagle Picher Site to the community through public meetings, announcements published in the El Defensor Chieftain newspaper, fact sheets, EPA’s website, and the Administrative Record file for the Site.

**Past Activities**

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in conjunction with the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED), conducted Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Studies (RI/FS) for the Eagle Picher Carefree Battery Superfund site (Site). A Remedial Investigation is an investigation to determine the extent of the contamination at the site and potential risk to the community. A Feasibility Study examines and evaluates various remedial cleanup alternatives.

An RI/FS was completed for the whole site in early 2014, and the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) on September 29, 2014. During this RI/FS, the EPA collected extensive samples of soil, soil gas, construction debris and groundwater to characterize the extent of contamination and risk to human health and the environment. Based on the data collected, the EPA proposed a remedy in the 2014 ROD for treating soil, construction debris and groundwater contamination present at the Site. During the ROD process, the EPA determined that there was insufficient data to characterize vapor intrusion risk in indoor air to residents living in homes that are located above the contaminated groundwater plume. Therefore, EPA decided to address the contamination at the Site in two Operable Units:  
• Operable Unit 1 (OU1) consists of soil, construction debris and groundwater  
• Operable Unit 2 (OU2) consists of indoor air

The OU2 RI/FS focused primarily on collecting data to determine if any risk is present to residents from vapor intrusion. From June 2015 through February 2016, the EPA conducted soil gas and indoor air sampling in areas south of the former Eagle Picher Site. In the first phase EPA collected external soil gas samples from approximately 40 locations near homes located along the groundwater plume area. Concentrations of volatile compounds present in the soil gas sampling indicated a potential for contaminants to migrate into indoor air. During the second phase, indoor air and subslab soil gas samples were collected from 11 homes that likely had the potential for vapor intrusion. To account for seasonal variability, two rounds of indoor air sampling was conducted first in November 2015 and then again in February 2016. Out of the 11 homes sampled only 1 home had indoor air concentrations that exceeded EPA and NMED screening levels. All others were either below the NMED screening level or below both EPA and NMED screening levels. Screening levels are protective of human health and are set by the agencies as a benchmark to evaluate the data. Merely exceeding a screening level does not mean there is an imminent health threat. It indicates that additional investigation is warranted.

**Site Location**

The Eagle Picher Site is located in the City of Socorro, Socorro County, New Mexico. The City of Socorro is located in the central part of Socorro County, New Mexico along the Rio Grande Valley. The Site encompasses two large tracts that are approximately equal to 55 acres and located along I-25, 2 miles north of Socorro, New Mexico.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state and federal actions. Both EPA and NMED have conducted various investigations, including sampling, at the site to determine the extent of contamination, potential risks to the community and various cleanup actions.
