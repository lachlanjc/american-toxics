### Background

The site includes 15 acres of a 37-acre fairground. The city of Tomah operated the area in the 1950s as an open, unlined dump while accepting industrial and municipal waste. Disposal methods and site operations contaminated the groundwater and soil with volatile organic compounds and heavy metals. After operations stopped, the area was covered and the site became part of the Tomah Fairgrounds. EPA added it to the Superfund list in 1987.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPAâ€™s original cleanup included land-use and groundwater restrictions as well as groundwater monitoring. EPA deleted the site from the Superfund list in 2001.

All wells have been abandoned and a state-approved long-term cover maintenance plan is being updated by the city of Tomah.
