### Background

The 60-acre American Creosote Works, Inc. (Jackson Plant) [Superfund](https://www.epa.gov/superfund) Site is located southwest of Jackson, Tennessee and includes numerous lagoons and other low-lying areas. The site is bordered by the Seaboard Railroad to the south, the Forked Deer River to the southwest, Central Creek to the north and west, and Industrial facilities to the east. The site’s broader surroundings include industrial, commercial and residential areas.

The site includes an area where a wood-treating facility operated from the early 1930s to late 1981. Several public and private wells are located within a three-mile radius of the site, including a city well field less than two miles east of the site.

From the early 1930s to 1981, a wood-treating facility operated at the site. Operations included discharging untreated process wastewater directly into the south fork of the Forked Deer River until 1973, when the operation built a levee around the facility to contain wastewater and surface water runoff. During construction, operations stored process water and sludge in pits on site that often overflowed into the main process area and the river during heavy rains and flooding. In 1974, the facility installed a wastewater treatment system.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1986 because of contaminated buildings/structures, liquid waste, sludge, soil and groundwater resulting from facility operations. By monitoring groundwater, implementing institutional controls and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, the EPA and [Tennessee Department of Environmental Control (TDEC)](https://www.tn.gov/environment.html) continue to protect human health and the environment from site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Site investigations and clean-up activities have focused on three areas, which the EPA refers to as [operable units, or OUs](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#o).

- **OU-1**: Cleanup focused protecting surface water, controlling access to the site and preventing accidental exposure to contaminated soil
- **OU-2**: Cleanup focused on contaminated surface soil, surface water, sediments and the aquifers affected by the site
- **OU-3**: Cleanup focuses on contaminated groundwater and dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL).

**1983**  
From June to August, the EPA conducted a short-term cleanup which included:

- Removal and treatment of about 30 million gallons of contaminated run-off water from the lagoons;
- Placement of the untreatable portion of contaminated water into empty tanks on-site for removal later;
- Removal of oily sludge from Lagoons 2, 3 and 4 and stabilization with lime kiln dust;
- Placement of approximately 10,000 cubic yards of stabilized soils and sludge into a pit excavated in Lagoon 3 and covered with a two-foot clay cap; and
- Installation of a control valve and drain pipe in Lagoon 4 to control the water level and drain the water to Clear Creek.

**1986**  
The EPA began a second removal action in March, separating and treating water and oil from the storage tanks on-site. Treated water was discharged to an on-site lagoon, and separated oil was pumped back to an above-ground tank for storage.

The EPA finalized the Site’s listing on the NPL in June.

**1989 - 1991**

The EPA issued the first cleanup plan for OU-1 to address surface cleanup activities and site stabilization while additional investigations of groundwater and soil contamination proceeded. The cleanup activities:

- completed construction of the flood protection levee;
- collected tanked liquid waste and sludge;
- treated the waste and sludge;
- incinerated the treated material off-site;
- demolished, dismantled and salvaged buildings, tanks, railroad lines, railroad ties and other plant equipment; and
- designed and installed a drainage control system.

**1993**  
The documented changes to the original cleanup plan for OU-1 in an [Explanation of Significant Differences](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/15653.pdf).

**1996**  
In September, the EPA finalized a cleanup plan in a [Record of Decision for OU-2](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/15742.pdf). The ROD addressed the cleanup of the creosote contaminated soils in the former process area and monitoring of surface waters, sediments and the groundwater to evaluate the effectiveness of the soil remedy.

**1998-2000**  
Under an agreement with the EPA, TDEC completed OU-2 remedial activities between September 1998 and May 2000. The activities included:

- removing, demolishing, dismantling, treating and breaking up facility structures into manageable pieces and buried on-site;
- draining and disposing of liquid waste and water at an approved off-site facility;
- excavating and solidifying contaminated soil from the former process area with cement, carbon and fly ash;
- backfilling and compacting the solidified soil materials in a 7-acre containment cell;
- constructing a geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) and a 24-inch soil cap; and
- grading the area and seeding it with grass.

**2006-2007**  
Dement placed fill material over most of the site, excluding the lagoons, to upgrade the area for use as a construction equipment storage yard and to comply with flood codes. Dement also constructed buildings on-site, including an office building and maintenance/storage shed.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [Seventh Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11200237.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2024. The remedies for OU-1 and OU-2 were found to be protective of human health and the environment.

Dement began placing fill material on site again in 2015. The EPA is currently working with the property owner Meadow Street Properties, LLC operated by Dement Construction Company, LLC to determine the analytical characterization of the fill material Dement placed to determine the next steps to ensure protection of human health and the environment.

The EPA began a feasibility study (FS) for remedial action at OU-3 in 2019. The remedial investigation (RI) and FS for OU-3 at the site is being completed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Investigation activities were designed to address specific data gaps and answer unresolved issues resulting from previous investigations. The objective of the RI/FS is to further delineate the extent of the dissolved phase contaminant plume in the unconfined aquifer in order to collect data to be used to prepare the OU-3 Record of Decision (ROD).

The activities conducted include:

- Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (NAPL) Delineation and Characterization – In 2015 the USACE advanced 36 soil borings at depth ranging from 20 to 80 feet deep to characterize the nature and occurrence of free phase creosote in the subsurface.
- Groundwater Delineation – An extensive groundwater monitoring system of 26 monitoring wells was installed in 2015 to better define the horizontal and vertical extent of the groundwater contamination on site.
- Dioxin Soil Characterization – Eleven surface and subsurface soil samples were collected for analysis of dioxin and furans to evaluate contaminant levels and determine if they pose an unacceptable risk.
- Surface Water and Sediment Characterization – Surface water and sediment samples were collected from the different streams, and lagoons onsite to determine if they act as a continuing source of groundwater contamination or as a transport mechanism to move contamination off-site.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

In 1991, the EPA fenced the site property.

According to the 1989 and 1996 RODs, deed restrictions are warranted to limit future use of the site to industrial uses. The property has historically been zoned for industrial land uses and remains zoned for industrial uses. When JEA owned the property, JEA filed a land use restriction with the Madison County Register of Deeds in July 2005. The restriction states that TDEC approval is required for any changes to the proposed use along with a demonstration that any such proposed use -- such as using the property for a residence, daycare, school or church with an outdoor playground — will not pose any danger to public health, safety or the environment. In addition, the restriction requires that, prior to any invasive activity that could compromise the integrity of the soil cap or lagoon clay covers present on the property, TDEC must be notified and a demonstration made that such activity does not pose a danger to public health, safety or the environment.

In October 2018, online sales information confirmed that property deeds reference the land use restriction in place for the site. The contaminant plumes are located outside of the restricted parcels to the southwest of the site. Additional restrictions may be warranted to capture the extent of contaminant plumes, which will be evaluated as part of the OU-3 remedy.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Investigations are underway to develop the cleanup plan for OU-3.
