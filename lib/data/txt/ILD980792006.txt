### Background

The Sauget Area 1 site is located in the villages of Sauget and Cahokia in St. Clair County, Illinois. It consists of three closed waste disposal areas (Sites G, H and I), a closed construction debris disposal area (Site N), a backfilled impoundment (Site L), an inactive borrow pit (Site M) and about 3.5 miles of Dead Creek. Following short-term response actions to protect human health and the environment, EPA is in the process of developing and implementing the site’s long-term remedy.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1995, EPA sampled, excavated, consolidated and covered 75 cubic yards of soil at Site G to protect public health and the environment. In 1999, EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order, or UAO, to the PRPs to conduct activities that included digging up contaminated sediment from Dead Creek Segment B-E, Site M and the basin area, and removing 22,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediment from Dead Creek. EPA pumped water in areas of Dead Creek to improve drainage and reduce standing water and placed a liner in the creek segment. A containment cell was constructed at Judith Lane in 2001.

EPA amended the UAO in 2001 to include cleanup of contaminated sediments in Creek Segment F and Borrow Pit Lake. The cleanup of Dead Creek and Borrow Pit Lake in Sauget Area 1 was completed in 2008. EPA approved the site’s Record of Decision, or ROD, for Operable Unit 1 in September 2013. This document outlines EPA’s plan for cleaning up remaining contamination at the site. It is the first of two cleanup decisions and cleanup actions for the site.

Under EPA’s cleanup plan, the selected remedy called for a Pilot Study of pulsed air biosparging to determine if the technology would be effective in treating contaminants at the site. The PRPs ran a pilot study using pulsed air biosparging from January 2020 to January 2021 and submitted the pilot study report to EPA in May 2021. EPA is currently reviewing the results of the pilot study.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being cleaned up by the potentially responsible party, or PRP, under state and federal enforcement agreements and oversight. EPA’s overall strategy for cleaning up the site is to first address soil, sediments, surface water, and groundwater contamination sources for OU1. Area-wide groundwater contamination resulting from contamination present in the Sauget Area 1 and [Sauget Area 2](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0500047) sites will be addressed in a separate cleanup plan. Groundwater is an environmental term for underground supplies of water.
