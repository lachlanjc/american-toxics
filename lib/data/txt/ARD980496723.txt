Background
The site is a 16.3-acre landfill on the flood plain between the Mississippi River and the St. Francis Levee in West Memphis, Crittenden County, Arkansas.  The Site is located at the southern end of 8th Street adjacent to the Tom Sawyer RV Park. Two barge terminals are located on the bank of the Mississippi River at the midpoint and south end of the site . Flooding is common between the months of November through June to a maximum depth of 15 feet. Aerial photographs indicate that the Site was excavated for gravel deposits resulting in a series of borrow pits that were subsequently used for the disposal of industrial and municipal wastes. The former unpermitted landfill area is subdivided into three separate disposal areas.  Area 1 (4.3 acres) consists primarily of a former municipal waste landfill.  Area 2 (8.1 acres) is predominately an industrial waste landfill with a large oily sludge pit occupying 2.5 acres of the area.  Area 3 (3.9 acres) consists of several smaller municipal and industrial waste disposal areas. The landfill on the site collected waste material beginning around 1957. The Gurley Refining Company used the site between about 1960 and 1970 for the disposal of waste sludge from its re-refining process west of the St. Francis Levee. The sludge waste in the pit has physical and chemical properties similar to material typically identified at oil reclamation facilities Between 1981 and 1988, EPA completed soil boring investigations of the oily sludge pit and surrounding landfill areas. Sampling found PAHs, PCBs, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, pesticides and heavy metals at the site.  Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The Site consists of a source control and ground water operable units (OU). The source control OU consists of a former unpermitted landfill area that is subdivided into three separate disposal areas. Area 1 (4.3 acres) consists primarily of a former municipal waste landfill.  Area 2 (8.1 acres) is predominately an industrial waste landfill with a large oily sludge pit occupying 2.5 acres of the area.  Area 3 (3.9 acres) consists of several smaller municipal and industrial waste disposal areas. The remedial action for the source control OU was completed in August 2000. The remedial action consisted of in-situ stabilization/solidification of 19,376 cubic yards of oily sludge waste and 20,372 cubic yards of ancillary soil, and the installation of a soil cover over the 4.28 acre area of treated material and an adjacent 2.7 acre area of the landfill in Area 1. Sampling during the remedial action confirmed that the in-situ stabilization/ solidification of the oily sludge pit and ancillary soils achieved the remedial goals and the chemical and physical performance standards specified in the 1998 ROD AmendmentFor the ground water OU, nine monitoring wells were sampled during eight sampling events in 2002 and the analytical results confirmed that the source area treatment and natural attenuation processes in the aquifer have reduced the metal concentrations below the remedial goals specified in the 1998 ROD Amendment. The nine ground water monitoring wells were plugged and abandoned in June 2003. EPA has conducted five Five Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site’s long-term remedy included the excavation, treatment and off-site disposal of contaminated sludge, soil and debris; a natural soil cover; installation of erosion control features; deed notifications; and groundwater monitoring. EPA later updated the remedy to include in-place stabilization and solidification of the oily sludge pit and monitored natural attenuation with institutional controls for groundwater. The in-place treatment of the oiliy sludge pit was finished in 2000. Groundwater monitoring has been completed. The central area of the Site (Area 2) is now occupied by an elevated, flat-topped mound containing the treated waste material from the oily sludge pit with a soil cover. The previous property owner brought concrete fill material in to raise the surrounding ground elevation consistent with the top of the mound, and above the flood level of the Mississippi River. The addition of concrete fill material to the Site by the property owner was also described in the prior five-year review reports. A vehicle security gate restricts access to the Site from South 8th Street. A security fence has been erected around the southern barge terminal to further restrict access. Another vehicle security gate restricts access from South 8th Street to the elevated roadway connecting the barge terminal located at the mid-point of the Site. There are currently no residential or industrial populations within the Site boundaries. Groundwater monitoring for the site has been completed. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2004. On July 4, 2024 EPA finalized the Fifth Five Year Review for the Site. ADE&E conducts annual institutional control inspections and post-flood site inspections for the site. The next FYR is planned for completion in June 2029. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Institutional controls were implemented at the site to prevent exposure to ground water and the treated waste and landfill contents. The Consent Decree entered in December 2000, required a property easement (Sections V.9.a and IX.24.b) running with the land that (i) grants a right of access for the purpose of conducting any activity related to the Consent Decree or any other activity related to implementing the ROD, including but not limited to, monitoring; and (ii) grants the right to enforce the land and water use restrictions listed in the Consent Decree to the United States, the State of Arkansas and its representatives, the other settling defendants, and other appropriate grantees.  The land and water use restrictions specified in the property easement included: 1) the prohibition on the installation of water wells in the alluvial aquifer until the remedial goals for the ground water operable unit were achieved (these remedial goals were met for the Site in 2002); 2) the prohibition on the removal of vegetation from the landfill cover if such removal may result in the subsequent erosion or removal of the soil cover over the landfill or treated material; and 3) the prohibition on the excavation or trenching into the treated material, landfill contents, or the associated soil cover with some exceptions. The property easement was executed on March 6, 2001 by the William L. Johnson Co. The prohibition on further excavation into the treated material, landfill contents, or soil cover effectively prohibits further well installation at the site due to the site-wide presence of the landfill and the treated oily sludge pit.     The condition of the soil cover on the treated oily sludge mound (Area 2) has not been an issue at any time since completion of the remedial action in August 2000. Property redevelopment activities are limited in the area of the treated oily sludge mound. The redevelopment activities consist of adding fill material to the flanks of the treated mound area and grading the fill to a gentle slope back to the bank of the Mississippi River. The addition of fill material has covered the top and flanks of the mound area and has prevented any erosion of the soil cover due to periodic flooding by the Mississippi River. Additional fill material has also been added to the Area 1 soil cover. The condition of the soil cover on the Area 3 landfill has remained unchanged since the first-five year review. The source control OU remedial action completed in 2000 did not alter the existing soil cover in Area 3. Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
Currently there are no scheduled operation and maintenance requirements for this Site other than annual site inspections to ensure that the institutional controls remain protective of human health. The stabilized/solidified waste in the former oily sludge pit does not require any maintenance and was designed to remain in-situ based on the stringent treatment standards. A geocomposite liner was also installed to reduce possible infiltration. The soil cover on the landfill and treated oily sludge pit area does not require mowing or other vegetation control since the vegetation helps to reduce potential erosion during flooding events. ADE&E conducts annual institutional control inspections and post-flood site inspections for the site.

Emergency Response and Removal
Initial actions included fencing the site and constructing a berm around the oily sludge pit to minimize human exposure to site contaminants.
