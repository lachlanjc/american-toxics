### Background

The 9-acre Cape Fear Wood Preserving [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) Site is located in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The Site includes the area where Cape Fear Wood Preserving Company operated a wood-preserving facility from 1953 to 1983.

The EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1987 because of contaminated groundwater, soil, sediment and surface water resulting from facility operations.

The EPA and the [North Carolina Department of Environment Quality (NCDEQ)](https://deq.nc.gov/) have investigated Site conditions and taken steps to clean up the Site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. By treating and monitoring groundwater and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, the EPA and NCDEQ continue to protect people and the environment from Site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the Site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The EPA leads Site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with NCDEQ.

The EPA divided the cleanup into four phases. Phase I focused on removing hazardous materials and physical hazards from the surface of the site as well as demolition of on-site structures. Phase II addressed contaminated soils under an active rail line along the western boundary of the Site. Phase III addressed soil contamination. Phase IV focused on cleaning up contaminated groundwater.

**1989**  
The Site’s [Record of Decision](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/10024831) S long-term remedy included removal and disposal of tanks and piping at an off-site facility; excavation of contaminated soil; treatment of contaminated soil by using low-level heat to pull contamination from soil; replacement of dug-up soil; and reuse or treatment of wastewater on ite.

**1991**  
The EPA [updated the remedy in 1991.](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/26547) Updates to the remedy included changing the long-term remedy to use soil washing to address soil contamination, stipulating that contaminants generated by the process could break down under natural conditions, selecting an alternative plan for treating groundwater, recognizing the potential need for pretreatment of contaminated water, and selecting Bones Creek as the discharge point for treated water.

**1995**  
The EPA [updated the remedy](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/14229) to allow for discharge of treated water into the drainage ditch on the southeast side of the Site.

The EPA updated the remedy changing the groundwater cleanup plan to better address the dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) in soil at the Site.

**1996**  
The EPA updated the remedy removing part of the soil cleanup process and changing the point of discharge for treated water to the local water treatment plant.

The EPA completed Phases I and II.

**1999**  
The EPA completed Phase III, completing soil cleanup to levels that support residential uses.

**2001**  
The EPA completed construction of the groundwater treatment system for Phase.

**2004**  
The EPA completed an in-depth review of site cleanup operations and made several recommendations, including more rapid removal of DNAPL. The EPA discontinued the use of 12 wells used by the treatment system and installed four additional DNAPL extraction points.

**2009**  
The EPA completed a study of the spread of groundwater contamination, which was moving in a west-southwesterly direction. As of June 2011, the groundwater treatment system has treated over 35.3 million gallons of groundwater. The EPA removed and disposed of about 168,400 pounds of DNAPL at an off-site facility.

**2012**  
NCDEQ assumed responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the site’s ground water treatment system.

**2016**  
The EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the Site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The 2021 [Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11166410.pdf) concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires implementing institutional controls and taking steps to more aggressively treat or contain the DNAPL. The new remedy selected in the 2023 [Record of Decision Amendment](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11138193.pdf) should accomplish the changes needed to achieve long-term protectiveness.

**2021**

The EPA completed a Five-Year Review of this site in September 2021, which can be viewed [here](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11166410.pdf).

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The remedies at the Cape Fear Wood Preserving Site are currently protective of human health and the environment in the short-term because no human exposure pathways exist to contaminated soil or groundwater.

The EPA completed a Five-Year Review of this site in September 2021, which can be viewed [here](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11166410.pdf).

The EPA is conducting a Remedial Design of the remedy selected in the 2023 ROD Amendment, and expects to complete that design in 2026. Construction will follow and should be completed two years after Remedial Action construction funding is received.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires implementing institutional controls and taking steps to more aggressively treat or contain the DNAPL. The new remedy selected in the 2023 [Record of Decision Amendment](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11138193.pdf) should accomplish the changes needed to achieve long-term protectiveness.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, the EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA was unable to identify any viable potentially responsible parties for the Site. The EPA is using federal funds for site cleanup activities.
