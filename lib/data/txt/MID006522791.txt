### Background

Before 1964, a dry cleaning business that stored dry cleaning fluid in a 500-gallon underground storage tank occupied the former Adams Plating building. The tank was removed in the 1950s, reportedly due to leaking.

Ownership changed in 1964 and electroplating operations began, which used metals such as chrome, nickel and copper. Waste disposal practices before 1980 led to contamination of surrounding soil and underground water supplies called “groundwater.” The primary concern at the site was chromium in the soil. The government placed the location on the National Priorities List, or NPL, in March 1989. The NPL is a list of hazardous waste sites eligible for cleanup under EPA’s Superfund program.

Between 1980 and 1993, officials performed a number of investigations and collected air, groundwater, soil, and surface water data. As a result, removal actions were implemented as part of an emergency response. EPA signed a record of decision in 1993, completed the initial cleanup in 1994, and has performed three, five-year reviews to ensure the cleanup steps taken in the 1990s still protect human health and the environment.

In 2010 a fire destroyed the Adams Plating building. EPA and MDEQ conducted an emergency cleanup that tackled hazardous chemicals moving off the property due to the fire. In 2011, EPA demolished and removed debris from the building, removed hazardous substances stored on the property, and removed and replaced contaminated soil.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA is working with local and state agencies to make sure the community’s health is protected from environmental contamination at the former Adams Plating Co. The 1-acre property is located at 521 N. Rosemary St. in Lansing. EPA’s partners in the cleanup effort are the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, and the Ingham County Health Department.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is conducting its sixth five-year review of the Adam’s Plating Superfund Site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up - with waste managed on-site - to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. A summary of the cleanup activities and an evaluation of the protectiveness of the implemented cleanup remedies will be included in the five-year review report.

Cleanup actions at the site included:

- Removing contaminated soil and installing vertical barriers against clean filled soil to reduce recontamination.
- Monitoring groundwater to see any potential movement of contaminated groundwater off-site.
- Restricting site use.

During the five-year review EPA will be conducting a site inspection, reviewing the status of the cleanup, and conducting a review of the current data.

Other planned cleanup actions for remaining contaminated vapors at the site include:

- Installing a vapor intrusion mitigation system in the basement of an affected residential property to passively carry the contaminated vapors from underneath the building to the outside.
- Updating deed restrictions to require a vapor mitigation system be installed if a building were to be constructed on the Adams Plating site property.

The review is expected to be completed in June 2025.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Since 2011, EPA has completed additional site investigations to evaluate the nature and extent of hazardous substances, pollutants in source materials, soil, groundwater, and soil gas at or from the site.

Based on the concentrations in the soil, groundwater, and soil gas samples collected after 2011, EPA conducted additional investigations to evaluate the potential for vapor intrusion. If gases enter a home, occupants can inhale them, which can potentially affect their health. To determine if the potential for vapor intrusion exists due to the Adams Plating site, EPA completed a vapor intrusion investigation at structures next to the property. Investigators collected indoor air samples at properties in March and July 2016 and March and May 2017.

Findings from those samples showed there were no exceedances of vapor intrusion criteria and no immediate health concerns.
