### Background

The Burrows Sanitation site is located in Hartford, Michigan. Disposal of plating sludges, waste coolants and oils took place at the site from 1970 to 1977. Waste disposal operations contaminated groundwater, surface water, soils, sediments and lagoons. Following cleanup, operations and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included excavation and disposal of contaminated surface soils and sediments, rechanneling of an adjacent wetland, and installation of a groundwater extraction system. Remedial actions related to soils, sediments and the wetland finished in 1989. The groundwater extraction system operated from 1992 to 1995.

EPA designated the site as Sitewide Ready for Anticipated Use (SWRAU) in 2008. the Site was delected from the National Priorities List (NPL) in 2015.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Histoically, the Site remvoal and remedial actions occurred to address heavy metals and volatile organic compounds at the Site. The February 2013 Five Year Review found the Burrows Sanitation Site remedy to be functioning as intended and protective of human health and the environment.

### Sampling and Monitoring

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions in 1984 disposed of sludges and contaminated soils.
