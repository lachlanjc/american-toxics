### Background

The St. Louis sites, under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP), consists of two locations designated as the St. Louis Downtown Site (SLDS) and the North St. Louis County Sites. These sites contain radiological and chemical contamination resulting from previous Manhattan Engineer District/Atomic Energy Commission operations. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is the lead agency performing the remediation of these two sites. USACE’s website contains updated information on the status of remediation and other community information.

The SLDS is comprised of the Mallinckrodt LLC (Mallinckrodt) property and surrounding properties in the vicinity. This site is located near the Mississippi River, north of downtown St. Louis, MO. The selected remedy presented in the Record of Decision for the St. Louis Downtown Site (SLDS ROD) (USACE 1998a) requires the excavation and disposal of radiological and chemical contamination in surface and subsurface accessible soil resulting from MED/AEC processing activities. The selected remedy also includes monitoring groundwater of the Mississippi Alluvial Aquifer.

The North St. Louis County Sites are located near the St. Louis Lambert International Airport in St. Louis County, MO, and are comprised of the following properties:

\- The Latty Avenue Properties, including the Hazelwood Interim Storage Site (HISS), the Futura Coatings Company and eight vicinity properties.

\- The St. Louis Airport Site (SLAPS).

\- The SLAPS vicinity properties, consisting of approximately 78 properties between the SLAPS, the HISS, Coldwater Creek (CWC) and the properties along CWC.

The Record of Decision for the North St. Louis County Sites (NC ROD) (USACE 2005a) was issued on September 2, 2005. The selected remedy presented in this ROD requires the excavation and disposal of radiological and chemical contamination in accessible soil resulting from MED/AEC processing activities. The other components of the selected remedy include:

\- Implementation of use restrictions at areas under roads, active rail lines and other permanent structures at which the residual condition is not consistent with unlimited use and unrestricted exposure.

\- Dredging contaminated sediments from CWC to remediation goals that support UU/UE.

\- Long-term groundwater monitoring in selected areas where soils contaminated above remediation goals are left in place or where contaminated groundwater has the potential to degrade adjacent groundwater or surface water systems.

After September 2, 2005, a remedial action was implemented at the North St. Louis County Sites under the NC ROD (USACE 2005a). Remedial actions were completed at the HISS and Futura by December 2013. Investigation and excavation in other areas are in progress.

More information about the history of each site can be found at the USACE website link at the top of this section.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) continues to remove contaminated soils from property within the North County Sites and the St. Louis Downtown Site that exceed the remediation goals in the Records of Decision. The source areas have been remediated, with SLAPS completed in 2007 and the HISS/Futura area in 2013. In late 2012, the USACE began Predesign Investigation sampling of Coldwater Creek (CWC) and properties within the 10-year flood plain starting near SLAPS at the most upstream location within the site. Remediation of CWC and adjacent properties, if warranted by the Predesign Investigation results, is planned and executed as the results from sampling are available.

As of 2023, the Predesign Investigation sampling along the approximately 14 miles of CWC and adjacent properties is nearly complete. Once Predesign Investigation sampling is completed on a property, the USACE notifies the property owner of the property status.

While remediation is on-going at both sites and inaccessible soils remain on-site, Five-Year Reviews are conducted to evaluate the protectiveness of the remedies. These reviews consider any changes to health-based standards and risk factors associated with the contaminants of concern and evaluate whether the remedy is performing as expected. Each Five-Year Review Report is posted to this page under the Site Documents and Data section.

The USACE finalized the fourth Five-Year Review in August 2020. The USACE made the following protectiveness statements in the draft fourth Five-Year Review Report:

OU1 SLAPS

The remedy at the North St. Louis County Sites is expected to be protective of human health and the environment upon completion. In the interim, remedial activities completed to date have adequately addressed all exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks in these areas.

OU2 SLDS

The remedy at SLDS is expected to be protective of human health and the environment upon completion. In the interim, remedial activities completed to date have adequately addressed all exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks in these areas.

The EPA had several significant comments on the draft fourth Five-Year Review Report that relate to the protectiveness of the remedy which were not resolved by USACE prior to the deadline for completion of the Five-Year Review. As a result, the EPA made an independent assessment of the protectiveness of the remedies as follows:

OU1 SLAPS

The EPA is making an independent assessment of the protectiveness of “deferred protectiveness.” A protectiveness determination of the remedy at the St. Louis Airport site cannot be made until further information is obtained. Further information is necessary to evaluate temporary/interim institutional controls and the potential for exposures from inaccessible soils or identified accessible soils that have not yet been remediated; evaluate the vapor intrusion pathway; and to provide additional characterization of groundwater sufficient to delineate and monitor groundwater impacts.

OU2 SLDS

The EPA is making an independent assessment of the protectiveness of “deferred protectiveness.” A protectiveness determination of the remedies for both the accessible and inaccessible soils of the St. Louis Downtown site cannot be made until further information is obtained. Further information is necessary to evaluate temporary/interim institutional controls and the potential for exposures from inaccessible soils or identified accessible soils that have not yet been remediated; evaluate the vapor intrusion pathway; and to provide additional characterization of groundwater sufficient to delineate and monitor groundwater impacts.

The USACE and the EPA are currently coordinating on development of a Five-Year Review Addendum to resolve these issues and so that the protectiveness of each remedy can be determined.

### Sampling and Monitoring

USACE conducts ongoing monitoring of creek water and sediment to evaluate the physical, radiological and chemical conditions in the creek. The 2022 Coldwater Creek (CWC) surface water and sediment sampling events were completed in April and October of 2022, with surface water and sediment samples collected at 10 sampling locations. The data collected were compared to monitoring guidelines and/or remediation goals listed in the North County ROD. The results of the surface water and sediment sampling were all below the monitoring guidelines and/or remediation goals.

Following the major flooding event on July 26, 2022, the St. Louis District’s FUSRAP performed a data-collection exercise with more than 280 samples over the length of CWC within site boundaries. Samples were collected from surfaces such as roads, culverts, playground equipment, bike paths, guardrails and fences. The results of the exercise show that no radiological contamination above the cleanup criteria was re-deposited in the CWC floodplain by the flood water.

Monitoring for particulates in air, including radionuclides, is conducted by USACE around excavation areas. In addition to air monitoring, the USACE also collects any water which comes in contact with contaminated soil during excavation. This water is tested to determine compliance with National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit requirements. The results of this data can be reviewed in the monitoring reports posted on the USACE FUSRAP website below.

Radon in air is measured over six month periods both outdoors and in buildings that are above contaminated soils which are inaccessible. Gamma radiation is also measured around these buildings. Groundwater monitoring is conducted at select groundwater wells quarterly to assess the impacts of the inaccessible soil contamination on groundwater and whether contaminate groundwater is impacting CWC. The results of this monitoring can also be reviewed in the monitoring reports posted on the USACE FUSRAP website below.
