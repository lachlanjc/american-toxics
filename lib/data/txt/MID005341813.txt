Background
Gelman Sciences Inc., a former medical filter manufacturer near Ann Arbor, Michigan, left contamination stemming from years of waste handling on its facility grounds. A plume of 1,4-dioxane has spread through the groundwater in Ann Arbor and Scio Townships, including a western part of the city of Ann Arbor. In 1992, a county circuit court ordered Gelman to address the plume. Gelman was ordered to contain the plume, prevent groundwater use in contaminated areas, prevent well use within the plume or areas threatened by the plume, connect affected properties to municipal water. Michigan Environment, Great Lakes and Energy is the enforcement lead for Gelman site.
