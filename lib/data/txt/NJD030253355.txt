### Background

The four-acre former A. O. Polymer site, located at 44 Station Road in the Township of Sparta, Sussex County, New Jersey, was the former location of a resin manufacturing facility. From the early 1960s until 1993, the facility produced resins, plastics, paper coatings, and specialty polymers, and was involved in the reclamation of spent solvents. Poor waste handling practices led to volatile organic compound contamination of soil and groundwater at the site. The site has been the focus of regulatory authorities since the early 1970s, when local residents noticed odors in the air and well water. During operation of the site, the State cited the operator twice for improperly discharging plant wastewater, and thirteen times for air quality violations. In 1978, the Sparta Health Department and the State found volatile organic compounds in three domestic water wells adjoining the site. These domestic wells were abandoned and the properties were connected to the public water supply.

Short-term response actions removed stockpiled drums and contaminated soils from a former disposal pit area, and disposed of them offsite. Long-term remedial measures included installation of a groundwater pump-and-treatment system to remove contamination from groundwater, and installation of a soil vapor extraction system to remove soil contaminants beneath the disposal pit area. Both short-term and long-term response measues have been completed and all environmental remediation equipment has been removed from the site. Groundwater continues to be monitored.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

During the 1982 removal action 1,970 cubic yards (3,152 tons) of contaminated soils, 900 drums, and 120 cubic yards of debris were removed from the disposal pit area. In the early 1990s, while pursuing long-term remedial response actions to address the threat posed by contaminated soils located beneath the disposal pits, a more immediate threat developed when the site owner abandoned the property. Removal actions were taken by the EPA to address the health threats posed by the unsecured hazardous waste in the abandoned buildings and tanks, as well as hazardous materials stockpiled on an adjoining property. Under these immediate actions, EPA removed over 34,000 pounds of hazardous waste, 37,600 pounds of non-hazardous waste, 3,491 gallons of bulked hazardous liquids, 91 cubic yards of asbestos-containing materials, and 121 cubic yards of contaminated soil.

The site was addressed in two stages: Short-term removal actions, and a long-term remedial phase focused on the cleanup of the entire site.

Short-Term Removal Actions: In 1982, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection removed the contents of the disposal pit area and disposed of them off site. In 1993, manufacturing operations ended at the site, and the property owner abandoned the site in 1994, leaving behind unsecured hazardous waste. In April 1994, EPA initiated a removal action to address immediate environmental hazards posed by the abandoned facility. In addition, EPA also performed a separate removal action to address hazardous materials stockpiled by the site owner on an adjoining property.

Long-Term Remedial Actions: As part of the long-term remedial phase, studies were conducted that found widespread groundwater contamination at the site which was traced to a source in the soils beneath the former disposal pit area. In the spring of 1992, EPA ordered the site’s potentially responsible parties to conduct the remedial design and implement the long-term remedial actions. A soil vapor extraction system, designed to remove soil contaminants beneath the former lagoon area, began operating in 1995. A groundwater pump-and-treatment system began operating in August of 1998.

In July 2018, EPA signed an Explanation of Significant Differences to explain the modifications to the Soil Vapor Extraction and groundwater treatment remedy. The change to the remedy provided for the enhancement of the SVE and groundwater treatment systems using *In-Situ* Thermal Remediation, as well as the use of an interim groundwater cleanup goal of 300 micrograms per liter (µg/L) for Trichloroethylene (TCE) within the thermal treatment area. The enhancement to the soil vapor extraction and groundwater treatment systems resulted in approximately 99% mass removal of TCE across the Site. Thermal treatment at the site was completed in April 2019. Following successful heat treatment, the groundwater pump and treatment system was shut down in the fall of 2020. Long-term groundwater monitoring continues at the Site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA placed the site on the Superfund Program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1983, following site investigations and the short-term removal actions that were taken to protect human health and the environment. EPA deleted the Facility Area portion of the Site from the NPL on August 26, 2000. The site was sold to a private developer in 2009 and underwent redevelopment. The SVE system has achieved soil cleanup goals and was shut down, dismantled, and removed from the site in 2018. The groundwater treatment system, optimized by heat treatment, shut down in 2020 after reaching an interim groundwater cleanup goal for TCE. The groundwater pump and treatment system has also been dismantled and removed from the site. Long-term groundwater monitoring will continue.
