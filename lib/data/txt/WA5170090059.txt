### Background

The Naval Air Station (NAS), Whidbey Island (Ault Field) site is located on Whidbey Island, Washington, at the northern edge of the Puget Sound. NAS Whidbey Island is one of two separate sites located on Whidbey Island. The second site is referred to as the Naval Air Station (NAS), Whidbey Island (Seaplane Base). Since the 1940s, operations at the air station have generated a variety of hazardous wastes. These activities contaminated soil, sediments and groundwater with hazardous chemicals.

NAS Whidbey Island was commissioned on September 21, 1942. Originally, NAS Whidbey Island was used for seaplane patrol operations, rocket firing training, torpedo overhaul, and both recruit and Petty Officer training. After World War II, the facility was placed on reduced operating status and, in December 1949, was upgraded to increase its Pacific Fleet support capabilities. The Ault Field site has been separated into four OUs (1, 2, 3 and 5). The Seaplane Base is OU-4. The station’s current mission is to maintain and operate Navy aircraft and aviation facilities, and to provide associated support activities.

Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires maintenance of land use controls and routine maintenance and monitoring at OU-1 – Area 6.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1990, the U.S. Navy signed a Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) with EPA and the state to address site contamination. EPA divided the site into four separate areas, or operable units (OUs), to better address cleanup. The OUs address landfill areas, fire training areas, waste storage and disposal areas, and site ditches. The site’s long-term remedy for these areas included excavation of contaminated soil and sediment; land use controls; groundwater monitoring; groundwater extraction and treatment; landfill capping; bio-venting; and oil skimming. Remedy construction took place between 1993 and 1997.  

### Sampling and Monitoring

Groundwater monitoring is performed periodically at this site (specifically at Operable Unit 2) as a part of the institutional controls for this area.
