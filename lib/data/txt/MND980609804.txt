Background
The 80-acre Reilly Tar & Chemical Corporation/St. Louis Park Plant site (Reilly site) is located near the intersection of Louisiana Avenue and U.S. Highway 7 in the city of St. Louis Park, in Hennepin County, Minnesota, as shown on the site map (PDF) (1pp, 2.46MB, About PDF). From 1917 to 1972, Republic Creosoting Company, owned by Reilly Industries, operated a coal tar distillation and wood treatment facility at the site. The facility discharged thousands of gallons per week of wastewater in several ditches that flowed to an adjacent peat bog. (A bog is a wetland that accumulates peat, a deposit of dead plant material.) The wastes generated at the site were mostly polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs), which contaminated soil at the site, the peat bog, and groundwater beneath the site. Six drinking water wells in St. Louis Park, and one in the city of Hopkins, were closed due to contamination. In 1972, the site was sold to the City of St. Louis Park. From 1978 to 1981, seven municipal wells were closed due to contamination. In 2002 the city redeveloped the site into Louisiana Oaks Park. Portions of the northern end of the site have been developed as a residential complex. Periodically, the city conducts work at the site that requires digging. Plans for the work, including safe handling of any contaminated soils that are found, and air monitoring to protect workers and nearby residents, are approved by EPA and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
This site is being addressed through federal, state, municipal, and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. Several site cleanup milestones have already been achieved. In 1984, EPA issued a remedy decision for construction of a drinking water treatment plant for two St. Louis Park wells, and the plant was constructed in 1985. In 1986, EPA selected a remedy for most of the remainder of the site. The bog was filled and covered with clean fill in 1986. The city began pumping two wells to control more highly-contaminated groundwater near the source in 1987. In subsequent years, the city began pumping additional wells further from the source to control the spread of the plume. A treatment plant for St. Louis Park drinking water well SLP4 was added in 1992. It is estimated that approximately 47,000 people use the groundwater from aquifers near the site, which are now treated to meet all required health standards. (An aquifer is a natural underground layer, often of sand or gravel, that contains water.) The remedy left contaminated soil in place at the site, covered by clean soil.

A more detailed explanation of response actions appears in the 2016 Fifth Five-Year Review Report (PDF) (75 pp, 40.98MB, About PDF). Five-year reviews are prepared to evaluate the implementation and performance of site remedies to determine if they remain protective of human health and the environment. Generally, reviews begin five years following the start of a CERCLA response action and are repeated every succeeding five years so long as future uses of the site remain restricted.

What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA completed its sixth five-year review of the Reilly Tar & Chemical Corp. (St. Louis Park Plant) Superfund site in June 2021. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed onsite – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. The report’s protectiveness statement states: “The remedy at the site currently protects human health and the environment because drinking water affected by site-related contamination is being treated prior to use.” Read the full report: Sixth Five-Year Review Report - Reilly Tar & Chemical Corp. (St. Louis Park Plant) June 2021 (PDF) (127pp, 18MB, About PDF). EPA is working with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) and the city of St. Louis Park to oversee the city’s groundwater monitoring to ensure the treatment remains effective.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
See the Institutional Controls section of the Fifth Five-Year Review Report (2016) (PDF) (75 pp, 40.39MB, About PDF) for a summary of the site’s planned and/or implemented institutional controls (ICs). Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
The City of St. Louis Park monitors groundwater contamination and operates several pumping wells at the site. St. Louis Park regularly samples water quality in municipal drinking water wells and also samples a wide network of 75 groundwater monitoring wells in 5 aquifers. EPA, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), and MDH oversee the City’s groundwater monitoring and ensure that the treatment remains effective.

Enforcement Information
The United States District Court for the District of Minnesota approved a proposed amended consent decree and remedial action plan (CD-RAP) Exit that had been lodged by the U.S. Department of Justice in October 2019. The city of St. Louis Park was notified accordingly on July 23, 2020. An objector has filed an appeal regarding the court’s decision, which is currently being handled by the Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division's Appellate Section. The consent decree allows for the City of St. Louis Park to continue implementing the ongoing cleanup of groundwater contamination at the Reilly Tar & Chemical Corp. site. It addresses issues raised by: 
the 2016 bankruptcy liquidation of Reilly Tar’s successor in liability,
updated state and federal performance standards for various contaminants of concern, and
an evolved understanding of the conceptual site model. 
The consent decree reflects a cooperative approach among the remaining parties. Under its provisions, the City of St. Louis Park formally undertakes the obligation to finance and perform the remaining work addressing contaminated groundwater. The consent decree replaces the 1986 Consent Decree (PDF) (95 pp, 3.1MB(95 pp, y, 3.1 MB, About PDF))﻿ and Remedial Action Plan (PDF) (195 pp, 6.13MB) to ensure continued protection of human health and the environment.
