### Background

The 18-acre Amnicola Dump site is located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It includes an area used for construction debris disposal from 1970 to 1973. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983 because of contaminated debris, groundwater and soil resulting from facility operations. EPA, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) and the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. In 1996, following cleanup activities, EPA took the site off the NPL.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s PRPs led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and TDEC.

- In 1989, EPA issued the cleanup plan (a Record of Decision, or ROD) for the site. It included digging up and screening contaminated soil and debris; treating contaminated soil on site; disposing of any contaminated debris off site; placing a solidified mass on site, above the groundwater table, and outside the 100-year floodplain; monitoring groundwater quality for four years; and conducting a public health assessment five years after cleanup activities.
- In 1993, EPA updated the remedy, requiring off-site disposal of contaminated soils and debris instead of on-site treatment.
- The site’s first and final Five-Year Review, completed in 1997, found that the site’s cleanup approach continues to protect people and the environment. In 1997, the PRPs discontinued quarterly groundwater monitoring based on a Five-Year Review recommendation.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is an inactive construction debris disposal area in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Commercial properties, including a restaurant, a recycling business and warehouse-based businesses, surround much of the site to the east and south. Forested areas border the site to the north. The Tennessee River borders the site to the west.

During the 1930s, operators reportedly used the area for clay mining operations. Operations left several water-filled pits at the site. From 1970 to 1973, the City of Chattanooga operated a dump on the property. The site owner reportedly handled, stored and burned creosote-contaminated railroad ties on the site during this time. In 1973, the City of Chattanooga closed dump operations due to EPA and TDEC concerns over unauthorized dumping and the discharge of leachate from the site into the Tennessee River. As part of closure activities, the city covered the disposal area and improved site drainage.

- In 1983, EPA listed the site on the NPL.
- In 1993, the site’s PRPs completed all cleanup activities. These activities included digging up and disposing of contaminated soil and debris off site and filling in the dug-up areas with stone.
- Following cleanup activities, EPA took the site off the NPL.
