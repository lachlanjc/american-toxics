### Background

The Torch Lake site is located on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Houghton County, Michigan. The site includes several areas ranging in size from about 10 acres to over 200 acres. Copper mining activities in the area from the 1890s until 1969 produced mill tailings (called stamp sands) that contaminated lake sediments and the shoreline. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal Superfund-lead actions. The State of Michigan is responsible for operation and maintenance activities.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires compliance with effective institutional controls and ongoing monitoring of Torch Lake.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included covering 800 acres of slag piles and tailings with soil and vegetation, long-term monitoring of Torch Lake, and institutional controls. Construction of the soil and vegetative cap started in September 1998. Long-term monitoring of Torch Lake started in 1999. Remediation of the 800 acres of stamp sands and slag finished in 2005. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

Additional work on the site includes a pilot project on Gull Island, which is located in the middle of Torch Lake. In 2003, EPA, the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) and MDEQ planted around 15,000 fast-growing plants on the island to determine if they would grow without the addition of clean soil cover. EPA has closely monitored this project. In 2004, an additional 20,000 plants were planted. Field inspections during the summer of 2007 showed a lack of growth for some of the most recent plantings; however, the areas where trees and shrubs were planted are successfully established.  

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions disposed of drums and contaminated soil from the lake.
