Background
The Metaltec/Aerosystems site is located in Franklin, New Jersey. The Aerosystems Technology Corporation (Aerosystems) and the Metaltec Corporation (Metaltec), a subsidiary to Aerosystems, made ballpoint pen parts, paint spraying equipment, lipstick cases and a variety of other metal products on site from 1965 until 1980. When active, the 15.5-acre area included the Metaltec plant, a process well, a wastewater lagoon, a drum storage area, wastewater-soaked ground and two piles of waste material.  Plant operations contaminated soil and groundwater with heavy metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs are potentially harmful contaminants. Sources of contamination at the site have been remediated. Long-term groundwater treatment is ongoing. Under current conditions at the site, potential or actual human exposures are under control. After conducting investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In 1980, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) began sampling the facility's wastewater lagoon and surrounding soil as part of a site inspection. Results revealed the presence of VOCs and heavy metals. These contaminants leached from the lagoon into surrounding groundwater, and upon sampling residential wells, the state found VOCs at levels above federal standards for drinking water. The Franklin Water Supply Well and contaminated private wells were closed in 1980, and affected residents were connected to the Borough's primary water supply. This site is being addressed in two long-term remedial phases, the first of which focused on source control of site contaminants and the second is addressing groundwater cleanup.  Response Action Status Source Control: In 1986, EPA selected a remedy for cleaning up the sources of contamination at the site. The remedy featured: (1) excavating and treating 10,000 cubic yards of soils contaminated with VOCs in Parcel 1 and taking them off-site for disposal at an EPA-approved landfill; (2) excavating contaminated soils from Parcels 2, 3, and 4 and disposing of them off site at an EPA-approved landfill; (3) providing an alternate water supply for Franklin to replace lost drinking water capacity; and (4) studying the site further to identify the extent of groundwater contamination and to evaluate the best options for cleanup. In 1988, EPA excavated 5,000 cubic yards of soil from Parcels 2, 3, and 4, transported them to an approved landfill and backfilled the excavated areas with clean fill. An alternate water supply pipeline to provide water from two privately developed wells was completed in 1991. Cleanup of contaminated soils from Parcel 1, which was initiated in 1993, was completed in March 1995. Groundwater: In 1989, EPA completed a study of groundwater contamination at the site. A Record of Decision, issued in 1990, selected a remedy for the site which included extracting the contaminated groundwater and treating it by air stripping to remove the VOCs. Any remaining organic contaminants would be removed by carbon adsorption. The remedial design for the groundwater extraction and treatment system was completed in September 2006, and the remedial construction was completed in June 2009.  The groundwater extraction and treatment system is currently in the Long-Term Response Action period.  This has further reduced the potential for exposure to hazardous material and is preventing the spread of and cleaning up the contamination on-site. The treated groundwater is discharged into an unnamed tributary of Wildcat Brook. The site is monitored to ensure the effectiveness of the remedy. The source control actions and the groundwater restoration efforts described above have greatly reduced the potential for exposure to hazardous materials at the Metaltec/Aerosystems site.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The source control actions and the completion of cleanup measures described above have greatly reduced the potential for exposure to hazardous materials at the Metaltec/Aerosystems site while further cleanup activities are being planned and enacted. The remedial design for the groundwater extraction and treatment system was completed, and the remedial action was funded in September 2006. Construction began in March 2008 and was completed in June 2009. The groundwater extraction and treatment system is currently in the Long-Term Response Action period. In July 2020, EPA transferred the responsibility for operation of the groundwater extraction and treatment system from EPA to NJDEP. Top of Page
