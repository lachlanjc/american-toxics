### Background

The Conservation Chemical Company Site is a 6 -acre area in Kansas City, Missouri. Chemical storage and disposal operations from the 1960s to the 1980s led to contamination of groundwater and soils. The Conservation Chemical Company handled an estimated 48 million gallons of liquids and sludges and 1,144 tons of solids and buried 93,000 cubic yards of materials at the site. Groundwater, on and off the site, contains metals, cyanide, phenolic compounds and volatile organic compounds (VOCs); soils contained the previously-listed contaminants and dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

The long-term remedy included dismantling buildings, equipment and drums; installing a permeable soil cap and security fence; extracting groundwater and installing monitoring wells; treating groundwater and monitoring the quality and level of off-site groundwater. Construction of the remedy was completed in 1991. Additional findings led to the installation of a replacement well in 2007. Additional findings led to the installation of a replacement well in 2007.

The EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent Five-Year Review in 2022 determined that the remedy is protective.

The site’s next Five-Year Review is scheduled for 2027.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site remedy is protective of human health and the environment.

The site was visited on a daily basis during the high water event in March and April of 2019. Flood water encroached on the site; however, the water did not negatively impact the landfill cap. The flood waters receded and the site continued to be protective.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

There are deed restrictions in place for this site.
