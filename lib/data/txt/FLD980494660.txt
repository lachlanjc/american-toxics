### Background

The 101-acres Beulah Landfill [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located about 10 miles northwest of downtown Pensacola, in Escambia County Florida. The landfill operated from 1950 to 1984. Prior to the landfill’s closure in 1999, operators ran the site’s northern and southern sections independently. The northern landfill, used from 1950 to 1960, accepted mostly municipal trash. The southern sludge disposal pits began receiving domestic septic tank wastes in 1968 and continued to accept municipal trash, industrial waste, demolition debris and municipal sludges until 1984, when the state ordered a halt to operations at the pits.

In 1990, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency listed the site on the [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n). The County capped and closed the landfill under the State Landfill closure program.

In 1993, The EPA determined that no CERCLA action was necessary to ensure protection of human health or the environment.

In 1998, The EPA deleted the site from the NPL. The FDEP is managing the site under the State Landfill Closure Program.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The FDEP is managing the site under the State Landfill Closure Program. Escambia County is responsible for maintaining the vegetation and landfill cover and for preventing erosion. The EPA conducts Five-Year Reviews.

**1985**  
In 1985, Escambia County began landfill closure activities.

**1988-1993**  
From 1988 to 1993, the Superfund investigation disrupted closure activities.

**1990**  
In 1990, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency listed the site on the National Priorities List (NPL).

**1993**  
In a 1993 Record of Decision (ROD) EPA determined no action was necessary under the Superfund Law to ensure protection of human health or the environment at the site. This “no action” approach meant that EPA would not require a Superfund cleanup at the site. However, the ROD explained that Escambia County would close the landfill under the State of Florida’s landfill closure program, which includes groundwater and surface water monitoring.

**1994**  
Escambia County started the groundwater and surface water monitoring program in 1994. Escambia County has continued the monitoring program on a semi-annual basis as a condition of the state-administered landfill closure permit.

**1998**  
In 1998, The EPA deleted the site from the NPL.

**1999**  
Escambia County restarted the landfill closure process and completed it in 1999.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11189888) was published by the EPA in 2023**.** The No Action remedy at the Site currently protects human health and the environment because the former landfill has been closed under an FDEP-approved landfill closure program, including capping of wastes. Long-term groundwater and surface water monitoring is in place to ensure protectiveness. There are no complete exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks under CERCLA.

EPA plans to complete the next Five-Year Review in 2028.

A local model airplane club uses one portion of the site as a model airplane flying field. The other portions of the site remain unused.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Long-term groundwater and surface water monitoring is in place to ensure protectiveness.
