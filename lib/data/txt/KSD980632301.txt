### Background

The site includes a former municipal and industrial waste landfill on the upland area of an approximately 80-acre parcel of land on the southern bluffs of the Kansas River. The site currently is owned by Waste Management. A bulk fueling facility and a customer convenience center for refuse drop-off have been constructed onsite, but off the landfill cap.

Active landfilling operations were performed on portions of the site during the period of January 1952 to September 1970. The site property was operated as a residential trash disposal service from January 1952 until 1962. The trash was disposed in the horseshoe-shaped ravine area of the site. Industrial wastes reportedly were disposed of at the site, including, but not limited to, fiberglass wastes, paint sludges, spent solvents, metal tailings, soaps and pesticides. In addition, sludges consisting primarily of petroleum refinery wastes were dewatered in a surface impoundment constructed within the southern portion of the site. The site was closed as of November 30, 1970. After closure of the landfill, the site was used in 1977 for disposal of waste rock materials from the construction of Interstate Highway 435 (I-435). In May 1995, a portion of the site was used to store stockpiles of various aggregate materials and used as the access route to Shawnee Rock Company. Waste Management operates the landfill to the west and south of the site.

The site was added to the National Priorities List on September 8, 1983. The site remedy specified in the Record of Decision was to cap the wastes in place with an impermeable cap, then monitor groundwater and groundwater seeps to assure that contaminants were not migrating.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The selected remedy included the construction of an impermeable multi-layer cap over the waste disposal area and groundwater monitoring to determine the effectiveness of the remedy. Deed and access restrictions apply to the site. Construction of the remedy was completed July 16, 1996.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party actions. The EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews verify whether the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended. The December 2020 review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. While there are currently no known or suspected complete contaminant pathways, a proper monitoring program needs to be in place for the remedy to be determined protective in the long term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires maintenance of the vegetative cover, monitoring of any erosion or drainage problems, and continued operation, maintenance and monitoring of the remedy.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

A deed with restrictions consistent with the requirements of the Consent Decree was recorded with the Johnson County Register of Deeds on June 19, 1996. Access to the site is controlled by fencing and 24-hour security provided by WM personnel who operate the Johnson County Landfill.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The cap is in great condition and is maintained by mowing and removing sapplings that appear during inspections. Cap inspections are conducted twice a year (spring/fall). In addition to cap inspections, annual seep and groundwater sampling is conducted to monitor contaminants at the site. Groundwater contaminants at the site have been consistent over the past 10 years with contaminant concentrations fluctuating with no trend indicated. Seeps at the site have been typically dry at most locations with only two seeps generally flowing. Volitile organic compounds, semi-volitile orgaic compounds and metals have been detected in groundwater samples collected and were generally consistent with previous monitoring events.
