### Background

The eight acre Brandywine Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) site is located in Brandywine, Maryland. From 1943 to 1987, several U.S. Navy (USN) and U.S. Air Force (USAF) installations used the former DRMO property to store wastes and excess governmental materials. Site activities contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Removal actions to address contaminated soil and interim remedial actions to address contaminated groundwater are complete. The investigation to characterize the source of dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) in groundwater is complete. The Site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in May 1999.  
The [Record of Decision (ROD) (PDF)](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2255983) was signed March 28, 2018. The ROD discusses all activities prior to the selection of a cleanup method and describes how the cleanup method will be protective of human health and the environment.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

A 2009 Federal Facility Agreement (FFA) between EPA, Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and the U.S. Air Force identified areas for investigation and possible clean-up. The FFA provided a framework and a schedule to accomplish this work. Currently, there are two Operable Units (OUs) being addressed under the Superfund Program. MDE and the Prince George’s County Health Department continue to work with both the U.S. Air Force and EPA at the Brandywine DRMO. The site cleanup was divided into two Operable Units (OUs). During cleanup, a site can be divided into Operable Units, a number of distinct areas depending on the complexity of the issues associated with the site.

EPA has signed Records of Decision (RODs) selection remedies at the two DRMO OUs.

OU 1 – TCE Contaminated Groundwater (GW).

2006 ROD - The site’s interim remedy consisted of a shallow groundwater extraction and treatment system; treatment of the dilute shallow groundwater plume through installation of permeable biostimulation injections around the groundwater extraction trench; monitoring to evaluate the effectiveness of the interim remedial action and define the dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source area; and implementing groundwater use restrictions.

2018 ROD - The selected remedy consists of electrical resistance heating (ERH) of the shallow groundwater and the DNAPL zone and it includes a vapor recovery and treatment system. The remedial design and implementation of the ERH system was completed in 2018. The ERH DNAPL treatment is anticipated to last approximately 4-5 years and includes several years of groundwater monitoring to verify the ERH system has cleaned up the shallow groundwater and DNAPL zone or source area. Restrictions for development and the extraction of shallow groundwater are prohibited while the remedy is operated. All local private wells were closed and replaced with public water.

OU2 – Soil Contamination

2008 ROD – No Further Remedial Action Required. Contaminated soil was excavated and disposed of off the Site utilizing a Non-Time Critical Removal Action.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Currently, 2 Operable Units under investigation which may require a remedy at the site.

The U.S. Air Force has the lead role for cleaning up the Brandywine DRMO Site.

Per the Federal Facilities Agreement between EPA, the MDE and the U.S. Air Force, a Site Management Plan (SMP) is annually updated with activities at each operable unit and area of concern. For detailed information on the current cleanup status, contact the U.S. Air Force remedial project manager.

The U.S. Air Force conducted a site investigation (SI) to determine the presence or absence of Per- and Polyfluroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in the environment at Brandywine DRMO and released the report in 2018. PFAS are a group of synthetic chemicals that have been in use since the 1940s. PFAS are found in a wide array of consumer and industrial products. These compounds are a class of synthetic fluorinated chemicals used in industrial and consumer products, including defense-related applications. Aqueous film forming foam, firefighting agents containing PFAS, are and have been used to extinguish petroleum fires. The SI determined that PFAS has been released into the environment above the EPA lifetime health advisory (HA) levels. A PFAS site characterization investigation is underway. The U.S. Air Force is the lead agency responsible for cleanup of PFAS.

The **Community Involvement Plan** is currently being updated and is revisiting the need to reconstitute a Restoration Advisory Board and to further investigate potential environmental justice concerns. Not all surrounding communities will be impacted by site releases and remedial activities, and those that may be impacted may be impacted differently, depending on location. Each Federal agency shall make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations.

A full list of activities per each operable unit can be found under the Cleanup Progress section.

TheEPA conducts Five-Year Reviews (FYR) of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review, completed in May 2021 concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. The remedy is considered protective in the short-term until adequate PFAS and vapor intrusion data becomes available. The next five-year review is scheduled for May 2026.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

- The surface area of Brandywine DRMO is an open parcel owned by the U.S. Air Force and is surrounded by six feet tall fencing with do not enter warning signs.
- The use of groundwater wells as a potable source of drinking water is prohibited. The local homes have been connected to a public water supply.
- The Site is not suitable for residential land use.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions between 2007 and 2009 addressed soils contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the former storage yard, in wetland and non-wetland areas downgradient of the yard, and in the CSX railroad right of way. Actions also included the removal of underground storage tanks, the demolition of contaminated on-site structures and the removal of drums containing various wastes.
