Background
The Hydro-Flex, Inc., site is a three-acre area in Topeka, Kansas. Beginning in 1970, Hydro-Flex, Inc., made specialized tubing, hoses, heat exchangers and fittings at the site. From 1970 to 1981, operators discharged rinse water and sludge from a chromate metal finishing bath through a septic tank and into a series of buried silos. Wastes also were discharged into an on-site industrial well. After site investigations, the EPA and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) determined that the area did not pose a threat to human health and the environment. The EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1993.
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The EPA and the KDHE determined that the site does not pose a threat to human health and the environment. The site was deleted from the National Priorities List (NPL) in November 1993.
What Is the Current Site Status?
The first Five-Year Review of the site was conducted in 1998, and the site was found to be protective of human health and the environment. The second Five-Year Review was conducted in 2003. During this review, the EPA and the KDHE conducted a site inspection, and the KDHE collected groundwater samples. The second and final Five-Year Review concluded that the site continues to be protective of human health and the environment, and that hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants no longer remain on site at levels that do not allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure.
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
