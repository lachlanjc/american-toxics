### Background

The Delavan Municipal Well #4 site is defined as the contaminated aquifer used by Well #4. Well #4 was closed in 1982 due to contamination by volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Since 1993, Well #4 has been treated by a VOC-stripping tower. Stripping tower effluent is blended in a reservoir with water from two other wells prior to being pumped to the water distribution system. Concentrations of contaminants entering the water distribution system are consistently below levels considered a health risk.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through a combination of potentially responsible party (PRP) and federal and state actions.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy consists of an extraction well and groundwater aeration system that discharges VOCs to the atmosphere. Emissions are monitored regularly in accordance with an air emission permit. The discharge does not exceed permitted conditions.
