Reuse Assessment
  The Lower Neponset River Superfund Site Reuse Assessment Report identifies reasonably anticipated future land uses at the Site to guide for EPA's cleanup decision-making process and inform land use planning activities by state and local governments and other interested parties. The report provides background information and identifies current land use, ownership and demographic considerations at the Site as well as stakeholder perspectives and feedback gathered in 2022 and 2023.
  Neponset River Watershed Report Cards
  Each year, the Neponset River Report Cards are developed to measure and evaluate progress towards meeting the State of Massachusetts bacterial water quality standards for swimming, boating, and general health of the watershed.
