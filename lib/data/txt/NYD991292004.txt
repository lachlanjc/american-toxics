### Background

The Pasley Solvents and Chemicals site is located in the Town of Hempstead, Nassau County New York. The 75-foot-by-275-foot area is a former tank farm used for the storage of oils, solvents and chemicals. Poor waste handling and storage practices resulted in contamination of soil and groundwater on and off the site property with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in September 2011. A police station is currently located on site.

From 1969 to 1982, Pasley Solvents and Chemicals Company (Pasley) operated a chemical distribution facility on site. The principal activity at the site included the delivery of various chemicals to the site, storage of chemicals in on-site tanks and eventual transfer of the chemicals to 55-gallon drums for distribution. These chemicals reportedly included a wide range of aromatic and halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, various solvents, ketones and alcohols. Pasley also operated as a "scavenger," transporting waste and sludge to the site. Commander Oil Corporation owned the site property. Prior to 1969, Commander Oil Corporation occupied the site and distributed fuel oils.

After site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s NPL in June 1986.

Plato Holdings LLC bought the site property from Commander Oil Corporation in August 2003. The new owner leased the property to the Metropolitan Transit Authority. A police station is currently located on site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Following a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the nature and extent of the contamination and to evaluate remedial alternatives, EPA selected the remedy in the site’s April 1992 Record of Decision, or ROD. It included treatment of contaminated soil using soil vapor extraction and treatment of the 400-foot-by-60-foot contaminated groundwater plume using groundwater extraction and treatment. EPA updated the site’s remedy in May 1995, changing the groundwater portion of the remedy to air sparging. EPA entered into a consent decree with potentially responsible party (PRP) Commander Oil Corporation in January 1996 to implement the remedy.

Construction of the remedy finished in October 1997. During the operation of the remediation system, vapors from 15 on-property and five off-property extraction wells were monitored on a monthly basis. Air discharge, prior to carbon treatment, from the system was monitored monthly to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in removing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from soil. Groundwater monitoring wells were sampled quarterly from November 1997 through October 2000 and semiannually from November 2000 through March 2003.

EPA has conducted two five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The reviews concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. Post-remediation groundwater monitoring and confirmatory soil sampling verifies that the site has achieved the following ROD cleanup objectives:

\* The soils will be treated until the soil cleanup objectives are met or until no more VOCs can be effectively removed from the unsaturated zone.

\* Contaminated groundwater will be treated to meet either federal or state groundwater standards except in those cases where upgradient concentrations are above such standards.

EPA considers the site to be suitable for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. Therefore, no further five-year reviews are required for this site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site was addressed in a single long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.

EPA selected the remedy in the site’s April 1992 Record of Decision, or ROD. It included treatment of contaminated soil using soil vapor extraction and treatment of the 400-foot-by-60-foot contaminated groundwater plume using groundwater extraction and treatment. Construction of the remedy started on June 26, 1997 and was completed on October 21, 1997. The Operation, Maintenance and Monitoring (O & M) Manual was approved by EPA in November 1997. O&M activities were initiated in November 1997.

Groundwater monitoring wells were sampled quarterly from November 1997 through October 2000 and semiannually from November 2000 through March 2003. All treatment equipment was removed from the site in August 2004.

Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s NPL in September 2011.

### Enforcement Information

EPA entered into a consent decree with Commander in January 1996 to implement the remedy.
