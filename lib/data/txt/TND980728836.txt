### Background

The 27.25-acre Murray-Ohio Dump [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located on Glen Springs Road in Lawrence County, Tennessee, about three miles southwest of Lawrenceburg. Several streams are located near the site, including the Southeast Branch, Southwest Branch and Northeast Branch, which all flow into Shoal Creek. County and city-owned landfills surround the site. The site’s broader surroundings include rural residential areas as well as forested and agricultural land.

The site includes an area where two landfills operated from 1963 to 1982. Operations buried paint and electroplating sludge wastes from the production of lawn mowers, bicycles, toys and other metal products on 6 acres of the site. Operations released liquid waste and sludges into open trenches on site. The City of Lawrenceburg operated a sanitary landfill on the remaining area of the site.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1983 because of contaminated groundwater, soil, surface water and sediment resulting from landfill operations.

EPA, the [Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC)](https://www.tn.gov/environment/about‐tdec‐home.html) and the Murray-Ohio Manufacturing Company, the site’s [potentially responsible party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), have investigated site conditions. By conducting cleanup activities, monitoring on-site seep, surface water and groundwater, placing institutional controls on the site property, and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA and TDEC continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. A water line connects nearby residents and businesses to the public water supply.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA leads site cleanup activities in cooperation with TDEC.

The site includes two landfill areas covering 0.25 acres and 27 acres, respectively. The 0.25-acre area is known as the 1973 Disposal Area. The western portion of the 27-acre area is known as the Pre-1973 Disposal Area. The eastern portion of the 27-acre area is known as the Post-1973 Disposal Area.

**1990**  
The Murray-Ohio Manufacturing Company performed the site’s remedial investigation/feasibility study.

**1994**  
EPA issued the site’s long-term cleanup plan. It included

- a cover system for the Pre-1973 Disposal Area
- improving and stabilizing the slope of the existing cover over the Post-1973 Disposal Area
- a cover system for the overland flow area
- fencing of the disposal areas and institutional controls to prohibit the use of groundwater for any purpose and the use of the site for residential purposes
- maintaining the cover systems
- monitoring the site area
- establishing a contingency plan for the construction of a landfill seep collection and treatment system.

**1995 – 1998**  
The PRP performed cleanup activities from 1995 to 1998.

The site’s PRP placed protective covers over the landfill areas to contain the sources of groundwater contamination.

**2003**  
EPA began monitoring and maintaining the landfill cap cover system, including mowing and seeding the area.

**2005**  
EPA assumed responsibility for site cleanup activities.

**2009**  
EPA revised the cleanup plan, adding cleanup activities for off-site surface water and sediment in a tributary of Shoal Creek. The updated remedy included

- constructing wetlands during stream restoration activities to enhance the oxidation reduction potential and raise the pH of the water
- dredging, dewatering and consolidating sediment contamination
- constructing several wetlands to sequester metals within the surface water and sediment
- placing naturally occurring bacteria in backfill material to change the oxidation state of the metals within the sediment
- using monitored natural attenuation to address contamination in surface
- continuing to monitor groundwater and re-evaluating and maintaining the multi-layer cover system to ensure the long-term effectiveness of site cleanup activities.

EPA completed a focused feasibility study to address contamination in landfill discharge and began remedial design activities to address the 2009 cleanup plan revisions.

EPA is conducting on-site seep, surface water and groundwater monitoring and continues to conduct remedial design activities.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA completed the site’s [fourth Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2278054) in 2016. It found that the cleanup remedy remains protective of human health and the environment in the short term. For the cleanup to remain protective over the long term, operation and maintenance activities should continue and institutional controls implemented on the property.

EPA plans to complete the next Five-Year Review in 2021.
