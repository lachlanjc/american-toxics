### Background

The 40-acre Camilla Wood Preserving [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) Site is located in Camilla, Georgia. Louis Wood Preserving Company operated a wood-treating facility at the Site from 1947 until 1950. The Escambia Treating Company purchased the facility in 1950 and continued wood-treating operations. The Camilla Wood Preserving Company assumed operations from the Escambia Treating Company and continued operating until 1991, when the facility shut down.

The EPA placed the Site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1998 because of contaminated soil and groundwater resulting from facility operations.

The EPA and the [Georgia Environmental Protection Division (Georgia EPD)](https://epd.georgia.gov/) have investigated Site conditions and taken steps to clean up the Site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. By conducting cleanup activities, the EPA and Georgia EPD continue to protect people and the environment from Site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the Site. Contaminated soils were excavated and capped and the groundwater is being treated and monitored annually until cleanup goals are attained.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The EPA leads site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with Georgia EPD.

**1991**  
The EPA performed the following actions:

- placed a fence around the Site property;
- treated 95,000 gallons of on-site wastewater; and
- solidified contaminated materials placing them in an on-site storage area.

**1994**  
The EPA performed the following actions:

- treated an additional 52,000 gallons of on-site water, and
- removed and disposed of 30,723 gallons of contaminated materials at an off-site disposal facility.

**2007**  
The EPA performed the following actions:

- dug up and removed contaminated soils from the western part of the Site; and
- completed a time-critical removal action to excavate and remove contaminated soils to reduce concentrations of dioxins, pentachlorophenol (PCP), creosote, and carcinogenic polyaromatic hydrocarbons (CPAHs) to below removal action levels.

**2009**  
The EPA selected the long-term remedy for the eastern part of the Site. The remedy includes:

- stabilizing and solidifying contaminated soils in the source area
- stabilizing and solidifying the top two feet of contaminated soil outside of the source area
- sealing subsurface features
- installing a vertical barrier around the source area in the upper-level of the aquifer
- using monitored natural attenuation for the areas of the upper-level aquifer located outside of the vertical barrier wall
- carrying out stormwater improvements
- using chemicals on site to break down contaminants
- using microbial cultures to break down contaminants
- placing institutional controls on the site property to limit future land uses to non-residential uses, prohibit use of groundwater for drinking water, and prohibit soil removal or digging within the treated material area.

**2011 – 2015**  
The EPA completed the remedial design in February 2011. The EPA completed the following remedial actions in November 2015:

- a stormwater detention basin;
- constructed a vertical barrier wall and an engineered cap.

The EPA is working with the City of Camilla to place institutional controls restricting groundwater usage and protecting the engineered cap.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA published the [most recent Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11174350) in 2022**.** The remedy, as implemented, is protective of human health and the environment in the short-term because contaminated soils were excavated and capped and the groundwater is being treated and monitored annually until cleanup goals are attained.

The EPA is working with the City of Camilla and Georgia EPD to identify and implement institutional controls for groundwater and soils for the constructed remedy to remain protective of human health and the environment.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The EPA is working with the City of Camilla and Georgia EPD to identify and implement institutional controls for groundwater and soils for the constructed remedy to remain protective of human health and the environment.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, the EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA was unable to identify any viable potentially responsible parties for the site. The EPA is using federal funds for site cleanup activities.
