### Background

The 80-acre Holcomb Creosote Co. site is located in Yadkinville, North Carolina. It includes an area where Holcomb Creosote Company operated a wood-treating facility from the 1950s to 2009.

In November 2009, the NCDENR (now NCDEQ) inspected the site property and noted several areas of concern, including a creosote treatment vessel, a 55-gallon sump, a catch basin, a transfer area and underlying soils, a concrete storage pit, above ground storage tanks, and about 30 55-gallon containers. As a result of this investigation, the NCDENR issued several notices of violations to Holcomb Creosote Company, including failure to determine whether solid waste generated by the company was a hazardous waste; failure to obtain a permit for storage and disposal of waste creosote; and failure to treat, store and dispose of hazardous waste in compliance with state and federal regulations.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2012 because of contaminated soil, sediment, groundwater, surface water and on-site structures resulting from facility operations. EPA and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) have taken steps to clean up the site to protect people and the environment from contamination.

In October 2011, the North Carolina RCRA program referred the site to the EPA’s Superfund program to address known and potential hazardous waste contamination. The NCDENR has conducted a significant amount of work at the site under the RCRA program. With the transition of the site to the Superfund program, the scope of the environmental assessment at the site has expanded.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA leads site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with NCDEQ.

**2011**

EPA conducted an emergency response action to stop contamination releases and the spread of contamination into the unnamed stream and nearby Dobbins Mill Pond. EPA installed a boom across the stream to capture contaminated surface water, disposed of creosote-contaminated lumber, dug up contaminated soil, backfilled dug-up areas with clean soil, and removed site structures containing creosote-contaminated sludge. EPA also collected samples from the stream and on-site structures, removed contaminated soil from along the stream’s banks, and installed a fence to prevent trespassing on part of the site associated with the surface impoundment and sediments of the unnamed stream (tributary) of North Deep Creek. More information is available at [Response.epa.gov](https://response.epa.gov/site/site_profile.aspx?site_id=6638).

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA selected the following remedy for cleaning up the site:

Soil: Excavation of Contaminated Soil, In-situ stabilization/solidification of naphthalene and DNAPL contaminated soil, Disposal of Excavated Soil in a Capped On-site Containment Cell, Repair and Maintenance of Existing Caps, and Institutional Controls

Ground Water: In-Situ Chemical Oxidation, In-Situ Enhanced Biodegradation, Groundwater Monitoring and Institutional Controls

The chemical/biological oxidation processes in the groundwater destroys PAHs present in the dissolved phase and hardens the NAPL.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Fencing controls access to part of the site associated with the surface impoundment and sediments of the unnamed stream (tributary) of North Deep Creek.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The EPA collected samples of soil, sediment, surface water, groundwater and fish during the remedial investigation of the site from 2012 to 2014. Additional sampling was conducted to aid in the drafting of the remedial design.

### Enforcement Information

Enforcing environmental laws is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA is funding site investigation and cleanup activities.
