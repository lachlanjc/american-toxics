### Background

The 120-acre Petersen Sand & Gravel site is located north of Libertyville in Lake County, Illinois. Raymond Petersen purchased land in 1952 to mine sand and gravel. The company later dumped non-hazardous wastes, solvents and paint wastes in buried drums at the site between 1955 and 1958. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency inspected the site in 1971 and ordered it to close because of illegal dumping. The dumping contaminated groundwater, surface water and sediments with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Following cleanup, the Lake County Forest Preserve District (LCFPD) converted the quarry into a 115-acre recreational lake, which opened to the public in 2001.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Following cleanup, LCFPD converted the quarry into a 115-acre recreational lake, which opened to the public in 2001. LCFPD continues to monitor surface water and sediments at the site.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site included three disposal areas located in the quarry, just east of the Des Plaines River. The first disposal area, which IEPA reinspected in 1972 and found to be properly closed, contains non-hazardous wastes. In 1976, IEPA discovered 10 to 15 uncovered barrels of waste in the second disposal area of the gravel pit. Of these, about half contained paint and solvent wastes. Raymond Petersen owned the site until the Lake County Forest Preserve District (LCFPD) acquired it in 1979. In 1983, the LCFPD uncovered six more drums, containing unknown liquids in an area of the site outside the quarry, 100 yards east of the second disposal area. Cleanup included removal of hundreds of drums, 2,600 yards of contaminated soil and 26,000 gallons of surface water. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in February 1991.
