### Background

The 87-acre North Penn – Area 2 site is located in Hatfield in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. From 1963 to 1986, a former Ametek facility manufactured precision springs, reels and measuring and controlling apparatus, and used up to 4,500 gallons of trichloroethylene (TCE) per week as a degreasing solvent. Historical operations at the former Ametek facility contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. In 1986, the North Penn Water Authority detected TCE and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in on-site and downgradient wells. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In order to identify the source(s) of groundwater contamination, seven facilities in addition to the former Ametek property were investigated as potential source areas. The sole source of groundwater contamination was found to be the former Ametek facility.

Ametek treated and/or removed contaminated soil in 1987 and 1995. Sampling of residential wells in the area began in 1989 to ensure the protection of local residents from groundwater contamination while investigation into the nature and sources of the soil and groundwater contamination at the site continued. Ametek treated and/or removed contaminated soil in 1987 and 1995. Sampling of residential wells in the area began in 1989 to ensure the protection of local residents from groundwater contamination while investigation into the nature and sources of the soil and groundwater contamination at the site continued.

At the former Steiert property, lead contaminated soil and sediments were found during investigations. EPA oversaw the excavation of lead contaminated soil/sediment as a non-time critical removal action during 2007. Soil and sediment were stabilized and moved to an on-site berm which was capped and seeded. Post closure sampling was completed in September 2007. The approved final closure report for this removal action was submitted in January 2009.

At the former Ametek facility, Ametek treated and/or removed contaminated soil in 1987 and 1995. Sampling of residential wells in the area began in 1989 to ensure the protection of local residents from groundwater contamination while investigation into the nature and sources of contamination of the soil and groundwater at the site continued. The PRPs submitted an approved RI and FS and EPA issued the Record of Decision in May 2009.

The Final Design was approved in January 2012 and construction of the remedy took place in the spring and early summer of 2012. The main components of the remedial action were soil and sediment removal, and the continuing operation of a groundwater pump and treat system.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is overseeing the cleanup of the North Penn Area 2 site, which is being carried out by the potentially responsible party (PRP) for the contamination. The PRP, Ametek, agreed to investigate groundwater, soil, and sediment contamination which is summarized in the Remedial Investigation Report (RI). The PRPs also produced a Feasibility Study (FS) which identifies options to remediate the contamination. EPA approved the RI and FS in April 2005 and a proposed cleanup plan was issued for public comment in September 2007. EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) selecting the cleanup in May 2009. The final Remedial Design was approved in January 2012 and construction of the remedy took place in the spring and early summer of 2012. The main components of the remedial action were soil and sediment removal, and the continuing operation of a groundwater pump and treat system.

EPA conducts five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent, [2022 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/03/2329113.pdf) indicates that the site-wide remedy currently protects human health and the environment. However, in order for the remedy to remain protective in the long-term, the source of the change in groundwater flow and reduction of production well capacity observed in 2020 needs to be evaluated.

The next five-year review is scheduled to be completed by May 2027.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls are currently in place to protect the restored wetland, restrict future land use to commercial/industrial uses, and to prohibit any activity that could interfere with the operation of the groundwater recovery or treatment system. Additional information about the institutional controls is available in the [2022 Five-Year Review (pages 10-11)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/03/2329113.pdf#page=10).

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. EPA oversaw the excavation of lead-contaminated soil and sediment as a non-time-critical removal action in 2007. Soil and sediment were stabilized and moved to an on-site berm, which was capped and seeded.
