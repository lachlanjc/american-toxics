### Background

The North East 2nd Street site includes a former grain storage facility in Happy, Texas. The facility burned to the ground in 1962. Contaminants of concern include carbon tetrachloride (CTC), which firefighters used to put out the fire, 1,2-dibromethane (EDB), 1,2-dichloroethane (DCA) and chloroform. The selected remedy in the Record of Decision (ROD) is pump and treat. The Remedial Design was completed in June 2024 with construction anticipated to begin in late 2024.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is a former grain storage facility in Happy, Texas, approximately 30 miles south of Amarillo. Properties within a quarter-mile of the site include other grain storage facilities, light industrial operations, residential areas, a high school and an elementary school. A carbon tetrachloride groundwater plume is present in the upper transmissive zone of the Ogallala Aquifer, identified as a Major Aquifer in the State of Texas. The groundwater contamination originates from a historical release at the site. An explosion and fire caused the grain storage facility to burn to the ground in 1962. Firefighters used an unspecified amount of carbon tetrachloride to put out the fire. Monitoring wells have been installed and sampled which have delineated the extent of contamination. EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) on October 26, 2022 with pump and treat being the selected remedy.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA with support of US Geological Survey (USGS) is conducting Treatability Studies to support the final Remedial Design which is expected to be complete in early 2024. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) will provide funding for the construction of a groundwater pump and treat system consisting of a series of extraction and injection wells to address the carbon tetrachloride contamination.

### Sampling and Monitoring

EPA's contractor is conducting semi-annual sampling of monitoring wells at the site.
