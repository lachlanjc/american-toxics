### Background

The former U.S. Naval Construction Battalion Center (NCBC) Davisville is located in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, approximately 18 miles south of the state capital, Providence. A significant portion of the NCBC Davisville facility is located adjacent to Narragansett Bay.

In 1939, Quonset Point was acquired by the Navy to establish a Naval Air Station (NAS). By 1951, operations at NAS Quonset Point had expanded and became the Headquarters Naval Construction Battalion Center (NCBC). The NCBC loaded ships and trained men for both the Korean and Vietnam Conflicts.

NCBC Davisville was composed of three areas: the Main Center, the West Davisville storage area, and Camp Fogarty, a training facility located approximately 4 miles west of the Main Center. In December 1993, Camp Fogarty was transferred to the U.S. Department of the Army and subsequently assigned to the Rhode Island National Guard.

Adjoining the southern boundary of the Main Center was the Naval Air Station (NAS) Quonset Point, which was decommissioned and transferred to the Rhode Island Port Authority (currently named the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation) and others between 1975 and 1980.

In November 1989, NCBC Davisville was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) for evaluation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) program, commonly known as Superfund. Of the 24 suspected areas of contamination initially identified, 16 warranted investigations under CERCLA.

In 1991, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced that NCBC Davisville was closing under the Base Realignment and Closure Act (BRAC). NCBC Davisville was officially closed on April 1, 1994.

Details regarding the specific work performed and the current status of the 16 Operable Units are provided in the "Cleanup Activities" section below.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**Operable Unit 7 (OU 7)/Study Area (SA) 01, Site 02, Site 03, and SA 04 - Construction Equipment Department (CED)**

The investigation into the nature and extent of four areas was completed in 2016. These areas include the CED Battery Disposal Area (Study Area (SA) 01) and Drum Disposal Area, CED Solvent Disposal Area (Site 02), CED Drum Storage Area (Site 03), and the CED Asphalt Disposal Area (SA 04). The Navy removed 197 tons of contaminated soil at the CED Battery Disposal Area and the CED Asphalt Disposal Area in 1996. No contamination from Navy sources was detected in groundwater above relevant Federal and/or State standards.

A Record of Decision (ROD) was signed on March 25, 2021, selecting the cleanup remedy for contaminated soils at the CED Area. The major components of the selected remedy include Land-Use Controls (LUCs) to prevent potential and future residential use of the CED Area; development of a Soil Management Plan (SMP) to address how to safely manage soils exceeding the RIDEM Residential Direct Exposure Criteria (DEC), performance of annual LUC inspections to verify that site conditions remain in compliance with the LUCs, and five-year reviews (FYRs) to confirm that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

Although contaminants are present in groundwater underlying the CED Area above relevant State and Federal standards, the 2021 ROD did include a groundwater component because the contamination is migrating from an off-base source (the Former NIKE Battery PR-58 and Disaster Village Training Area) and is unrelated to former military activities at the CED Area. However, to prevent exposure to groundwater contamination, the Navy, as a separate action will establish LUCs prohibiting the use of groundwater underlying the CED Area until the cleanup goals and remedial objectives outlined in the [NIKE PR-58 decision document,](https://www.bracpmo.navy.mil/BRAC-Bases/Northeast/Former-Naval-Construction-Battalion-Davisville/) issued in June 2019 by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, are achieved.

In late 2021, Navy prepared a draft update to the base-wide Land-Use Control Implementation Plan (LUCIP) to incorporate the OU7 CED Area LUCs. Upon review and approval by EPA and RIDEM, a final Updated LUCIP will be issued. The property will be transferred to the Quonset Development Corporation (QDC) for commercial/industrial redevelopment in early 2023

**OU2/Site 12 - Buildings 316 and OU6/Site 14 Building 38**

In 1991, the Navy removed flooring materials and underlying soils from Building 316, the Defense Property Disposal Office (DPDO) Transformer Oil Spill Area, and Building 38, the Transformer Oil Leak Area. Additional sampling after removal operations revealed elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) outside the excavated areas. A final cleanup remedy was selected in the fall of 1993 requiring excavation and off-site disposal of remaining PCB-contaminated materials at a federally-licensed disposal facility. The design for the long-term remedy was completed in 1994. Construction activities began in 1995 and were completed in 1997. The excavation was performed up to residential values and no further action is required.

**OU 1/Site 9 - Allen Harbor Landfill**  
In 1985, contamination was discovered in Allen Pond due to sampling of the water, sediment, and organisms living in the pond. Given the landfill's location adjacent to the harbor, it is possible that leachate could have migrated into the harbor. An investigation into the nature and extent of site contamination and assessment of possible cleanup alternatives was completed and a remedy was selected in 1997 requiring landfill closure. Cap construction began in March 1998.

Another cap was constructed at the Site in 1999 due to the discovery of additional contamination after most of the inital cap was completed.

Over one acre of wetland mitigation was also completed in 1999. Long-term monitoring began in the winter of 2001. The first monitoring event report was submitted in July 2002, and monitoring/reporting is ongoing. Institutional controls are in place and being monitored on an annual basis. The most recent Five-Year Review occurred in 2023. EPA issued an independent finding of protectiveness for each of the remedial actions evaluated and specifying actions required to assess and/or ensure long-term protectiveness of human health and the environment.

**OU3 and OU5 - Site 08 DPDO, Film Processing Disposal Area (soils & groundwater), OU5/Site O5 Transformer Oil Disposal Area (soils), and OU5/Site 10 Camp Fogarty Disposal Area (soils)**  
The Navy investigated these sites in 1993. An additional investigation into the nature and extent of site contamination and assessment of possible cleanup alternatives was completed in the fall of 1995. From this assessment, the EPA determined that no further cleanup actions were required to address soils at these areas of the site. Groundwater was investigated and a final cleanup remedy of No Further Action was selected in June 1998. Additional metals-contaminated soil was removed in 2011 to facilitate the construction of a building at Camp Fogarty.

**OU4/Site 11 Fire Fighting Training Area, Solvent Disposal Area, and Disposal Area North West of Buildings W-3, W-4, and T-1**  
These areas were investigated in two phases. A removal action to excavate and send off-site 2,224 tons of PCB-contaminated soils was completed in 1997 at the Disposal Area North West of Buildings W-3, W-4, and T-1. A No Further Action ROD was signed for these areas on September 30, 1998.

**OU8/Site 07 Calf Pasture Point**  
Site investigations were performed in three phases, culminating in a [Record of Decision](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/46496) in September 1999 for groundwater monitoring and land use restrictions (LUCs). LUCs have been implemented and are monitored on an annual basis. Contaminants in groundwater discharging to the harbor pose no risk to public health or the environment. Long-Term Monitoring began in the summer of 2001. The first monitoring event report was issued in May 2002. The report recommended the installation of additional wells to monitor a newly found portion O of the plume. The second monitoring event took place in the spring of 2002. Off-site installation was completed in October of 2002.

Additional monitoring wells were installed in the Summer of 2012 and were included in the Long Term Monitoring Plan. Removal of approximately three tons of visually contaminated soil was taken off-site in 2011 after the Navy uncovered some cans of the five-year source material. Additional monitoring and evaluation took place during the 2018 ve-year eview. Navy and EPA agreed the remedy is currently protective and that additional work is needed to ensure the remedy will be protective in the future.

**OU9/Site 16 Creosote Dip Tank and Fire Fighting Training Area (Site 16)**  
Field work for investigations into the nature and extent of contamination were completed. The Navy found soil contamination in the northern part of the site and chlorinated solvents in groundwater moving across the site from previously transferred land northeast to Allen Harbor and east toward Narragansett Bay. This investigation determined there is no unacceptable risk to the commercial/industrial users of the site if the soil above state standards is removed, groundwater is not used for drinking water, and buildings are not built above the plume.

A cleanup plan was issued in 2014 requiring the removal of two feet of contaminated soil and one round of chemical oxidant injections into the groundwater. Contaminated soil was excavated in 2015 at the Creosote Dip Tank and Fire Fighting Training Area and the area was backfilled to grade. In 2015, permanganate was injected into groundwater underlying the Creosote Dip Tank and Fire Fighting Training area to treat the chlorinated solvent source area. The Navy is currently conducting long-term monitoring.

Institutional controls preventing drinking water wells or use of Navy-owned property for residential purposes have been implemented through the Lease In Furtherance of Conveyance (LIFOC) with QDC. The [2018 Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/100003653) confirmed that the remedy is currently protective. The Navy will perform additional work to ensure the remedy remains protective in the future. The Navy is working with the parcel owners to implement the institutional controls.

**OU10 QDC Outfall 001**  
The QDC Outfall 001 study area is currently undeveloped land, with the surrounding area used for recreational purposes, including the Quonset Bike Path. Based on a review of historical “as-built” drawings of drainage systems at the former NCBC Davisville, QDC Outfall 001 is the discharge point for an underground drainage pipeline that originates from the former Building 224. The former Building 224 and nearby truck wash pad and oil water separator were used by the Navy as vehicle maintenance and truck-washing facility and are the presumed sources of contamination present in the outfall area. Building 224 was demolished in 2006.

Contaminants associated with materials used in these activities or other historical activities conducted at the Former Construction Equipment Department (CED) Area may have been disposed of into the Building 224 drainage system, discharging at QDC Outfall 001. It is believed the primary source of contaminants in the wetland is the vehicle wash pad and oil water separator. Pesticides may also have been used by the Navy to control insects and other pests at the Site. The primary contaminants identified as being associated with the QDC Outfall 001 consisted of petroleum hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and heavy metals. The field investigation was completed in September 2016. The Navy removed contamination in 2017 but found additional contamination and drums. A removal action was initiated, eventually removing approximately 300 drums and 834 tons of contaminated soils.

A supplemental site investigation was performed in early 2020 to confirm the removal of impacted soils and evaluate the potential release of drum contents to groundwater. The Navy in coordination with EPA and RIDEM are reviewing the current information to determine if additional samlping is warranted to issue a revised Remedial Investigation report.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Long-term monitoring continues at various areas throughout the site, and a Five Year Review Report was issued in March 2023. An update to the 2018 Base-Wide Land-Use Control Implementation Plan (LUCIP) was issued in April 2023 to incorporate the LUCs required by the March 2021 ROD for OU7. Similar changes are not required for OU9 Site 16 because the changes memorialized in the September 2021 ESD did not affect the LUC components of the remedy selected in the 2014 ROD.

On March 28, 2023, the EPA completed the Fifth Five-Year Review process for the former NCBC Davisville military installation by issuing an independent finding of protectiveness for each of the remedial actions evaluated and specifying actions required to assess and/or ensure long-term protectiveness of human health and the environment.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The public needs to heed all signs, physical restrictions, and land use regulations. The public can also stay aware of any changes through local media, by checking in with this website, and attending the annual Restoration Advisory Board meeting, a venue for the Navy to update community members about cleanup activities at the site.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The Navy monitors the Institutional Controls (ICs), landfill cover, and gas, and samples groundwater at Allen Harbor Landfill, Calf Pasture Point, and the Creosote Dip Tank and Fire Fighting Training Area on an annual basis.
