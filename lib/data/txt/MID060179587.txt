### Background

The 80-acre Waste Management of Michigan – Holland Lagoons site is located near Holland, Michigan. Jacobusse's Refuse Service Company operated on site from about 1945 until 1972. Successor companies, including Waste Management of Michigan, operated on site until 1980. The area accepted solid and liquid waste for disposal. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil and created about the potential for groundwater contamination. Further study indicated that contaminated groundwater was associated with the adjacent Southwest Ottawa County Landfill Superfund site. Following cleanup, EPA has taken the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL).

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 2013.

EPA conducted one five-year review of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. No additional five-year reviews are required because the remedy allows for unlimited exposure and unrestricted use.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Prior to completion of the site’s remedial investigation and feasibility study, the site owner removed underground storage tanks, excavated potentially contaminated soils and the former municipal trash landfill area, and disposed of materials off site. All subsequent soil samples showed levels of metals at or below levels of concern. Based on these results, EPA selected a “No Further Action” remedy for the site. EPA took the site off the NPL in 2013.
