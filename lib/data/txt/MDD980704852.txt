Background
The Southern Maryland Wood Treating site was a wood treating facility located in Hollywood, St. Mary’s County, Maryland. The facility was in operation from 1965 until 1978. Twenty-five acres of the 94-acre property were utilized for wood treatment operations using creosote and pentachlorophenol (PCP). Process waste water was piped into six unlined lagoons located near the process buildings. The soil, groundwater and an adjacent stream became contaminated with the wood treating chemicals. The site operators abandoned the site in the early 1980s leaving behind the process equipment, deteriorating tanks of creosote and PCP, and all the contaminated environmental media. The site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in 1986 and deleted from the NPL in 2005. The clean-up objectives for the site were accomplished. EPA will not conduct additional five-year reviews of the site since no waste was left in place and clean up objectives were achieved. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site’s long-term remedy included installation of a sub-surface barrier wall and thermal desorption of contaminated soil. Installation of the barrier wall finished in 1990. Excavation of 270,000 tons of contaminated soil and treatment using thermal desorption units took place between 1998 and 2000. A water treatment system operated from 1995 until 2000 to remove contamination from stormwater and surface water while soil cleanup took place. A second water treatment system operated from 1998 to 2000 to treat contaminated condensate generated by the thermal desorption process. Following soil treatment, regrading and revegetating of the site with a diverse mixture of wildflowers and grains suitable for wildlife habitat took place. Groundwater monitoring took place from 2000 until 2002. The site received a Ready for Reuse Determination in 2004. After cleanup, EPA deleted the site from the National Priorities List in 2005.

What Is the Current Site Status?
All construction cleanup work for the site has been completed. The site has been cleaned to residential standards and has unrestricted use. In April 2005, the Southern Maryland Wood Treating Superfund Site was deleted from the National Priorities List. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent, 1999 Five-Year Review (PDF), concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The site no longer requires five-year reviews.

Emergency Response and Removal
The cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions included off-site disposal of hundreds of waste drums, as well as wood-treating chemicals and contaminated soil contained in several tanks. Removal actions also included demolition of on-site buildings in danger of collapse. Top of Page
