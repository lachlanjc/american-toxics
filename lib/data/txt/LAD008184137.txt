### Background

The Exide Technologies, LLC (Exide) Baton Rouge Recycling Center operated a battery recycling facility located in East Baton Rouge Parish, approximately 10 miles northeast of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The facility operated as a secondary lead smelter and refinery which recycled inorganic lead-bearing materials from early 1969 to 2009.

When the Site was idled in 2009, all remaining inventory and feed stock material was either processed or shipped off-site, and remaining waste materials were removed and sent for off-site disposal or stabilized to render the materials non-hazardous which supported placement in the on-site landfill. There are multiple unlined waste pits remaining at the Site which produce metals impacted leachate that is treated by an on-site Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and subsequently discharged to Bayou Baton Rouge which bounds the north and bisects the western portions of the Site.

In May 2020, Exide declared Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. On October 23, 2020, the facility was abandoned by Exide and placed into the Exide Environmental Response Trust (Trust). The Trust was managed by the Exide Environmental Corporation (Trustee) and the beneficiary was the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ). The Site is currently inactive except for continuing operations related to stormwater collection, waste pile and landfill leachate collection, and operation and maintenance of the WWTP system. The Trust scheduled the WWTP for shutdown on March 31, 2023, once settlement funds from the Trust were exhausted. On March 22, 2023, EPA Region 6 Removal Response Program received a request from EPA Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) to conduct an emergency response which would involve taking control/operation of the WWTP to avoid shutdown of the WWTP. The Trust continued operating the WWTP until April 10, 2023, when EPA officially took over operation of the WWTP.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Now that the site has been listed on the National Priorities List (NPL), it is eligible for federal funding. EPA will work with LDEQ on further site investigations and involve the community. The EPA is conducting a Non-Time Critical Removal Action (NTCRA) to continue wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) operations at the Exide Baton Rouge Site.

NTCRA are conducted at Superfund sites when the lead Agency determines, based on site evaluation, that a removal action is appropriate, and a planning period of at least six months is available before on-site activities must begin. Because NTCRAs can address priority risks, they provide an important method of moving sites more quickly through the Superfund process. The NTCRA is described in the Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis (EE/CA) that will been released for public comment.
