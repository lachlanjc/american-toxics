### Background

The EPA added the Meeker Avenue Plume site to the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in March 2022. The Meeker Avenue Plume site is in the Greenpoint/East Williamsburg area of Brooklyn, New York and spans several city blocks. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway roughly bisects the site in a west-southwest to east-northeast direction. The former ExxonMobil Brooklyn Terminal is to the north of the site, with residential properties and McGolrick Park located to the west and Newtown Creek to the east.

The soil, soil gas and groundwater at the Meeker Avenue Plume site are contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds, or CVOCs, including tetrachloroethylene, or [PCE](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts18.pdf), trichloroethylene, or [TCE](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts19.pdf), cis-1,2-dichloroethylene, or [DCE](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts87.pdf), and [vinyl chloride](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts20.pdf). The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, or NYSDEC, discovered the contaminants while overseeing the investigation and remediation of an adjacent petroleum plume, which overlaps the northeastern portion of the Meeker Avenue Plume site.

The NYSDEC has been investigating soil, groundwater, soil gas, and indoor air at the site since 2007. The NYSDEC identified several sources of the subsurface contamination and properties that pose a significant threat to human health and the environment. During their investigation, the NYSDEC installed over 25 sub-slab depressurization systems, otherwise known as mitigation systems, to reduce the impacts of vapor intrusion to residential and commercial buildings. These systems use an electric fan to prevent contaminated vapors from entering structures through the subsurface. The vapors are instead vented above the roofline where they quickly dilute into the atmosphere. The EPA signed a Record of Decision in 2024 to address contaminated vapors located below and inside of residential and commercial buildings in the same fashion as the NYSDEC. The EPA has not yet identified the full nature and extent of contamination in the groundwater, soil, or soil gas at the Meeker Avenue Plume site. Now that the site has been added to Superfund’s National Priorities List, the EPA is fully investigating the extent of contamination and will work towards cleaning up the contaminated plume.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The EPA has not yet conducted cleanup at the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA added the site to the National Priorities List on March 17, 2022. This will allow for a full remedial investigation to determine the extent of the contamination and how best to address it.

In the spring of 2023, the EPA began a remedial investigation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, building on what had already been completed by the NYSDEC. The remedial investigation will allow EPA to evaluate the site's historical data as well as the overall nature and extent of contamination at the site, and any human and/or ecological health risks associated with the site. This investigation will assist the EPA with identifying potential clean up options for the site.

### Sampling and Monitoring

As of March 2024, the EPA had collected air samples within 35 residential and mixed-use structures, 11 public housing buildings, and one public school. The EPA has results that show that no further action is needed at 29 of the residential and mixed-use properties, the 11 public housing buildings, and the public school. Four of the residential properties require additional monitoring, and two require the installation of mitigation systems. In December 2024, the EPA sampled 10 residential and mixed-use properties and additionally, will be conducting indoor air sampling in March 2025 and in subsequent years.

In 2023, the EPA sampled groundwater from over 340 monitoring wells in and around the current investigation area in the Greenpoint and East Williamsburg neighborhoods of Brooklyn as part of the remedial investigation of the Meeker Avenue Plume site. The EPA is currently assessing data gaps from the 2023 groundwater investigation and is in the process of installing additional monitoring wells. The EPA conducted a second round of groundwater sampling at 440 monitoring wells in September and October 2024, and will evaluate the results in early 2025.

### Emergency Response and Removal

The EPA will evaluate the site to determine what actions, in addition to actions already taken by the NYSDEC, are needed to address risk to people at the site in the short- and long-term.

### Enforcement Information

The EPA has not taken any enforcement actions at this site. As part of the process of evaluating sites on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List, the EPA conducts an investigation to determine if there are viable parties that should be held legally responsible for needed cleanup actions.
