### Background

The U.S. Army at Redstone Arsenal (RSA) is an active installation that encompasses 38,300 acres of land southwest of Huntsville, Alabama. Since opening in the early 1940s, development within RSA has largely revolved around the historical need to produce, and later dispose of, conventional and chemical munitions. From 1942 to 1945, DA operations were used to manufacture raw materials for toxic agents and incendiary materials, and to assemble, store, and ship the final products. Onsite waste disposal activities included the disposal of construction debris, drums, and chemical munitions, and open burning of combustible materials.

After the war, the RSA became a center for the receipt, storage, and demilitarization of Allied and German chemical agents. In 1949, RSA’s mission changed to research and development of rocketry and guided missile systems. In 1960, civilian rocketry and missile activities were transferred to National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) [The George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC)](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/cadminrecord.cfm?id=0400440) which is located in the central portion of the installation (1,841 acres).

Since then, the area known as MSFC has been used to develop, test, and manufacture space vehicles and components. MSFC is NASA’s principal propulsion development center. NASA uses a state of the art propulsion laboratory for developing and testing the newest propulsion system innovations at MSFC. Its scientists, engineers, and support personnel also play a major role in managing experiments conducted on the International Space Station and management and development of the Space Launch System.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency added RSA (DA/NASA) to the NPL by publication in the Federal Register (FR), 59 FR 27989, on May 31, 1994. MSFC is included in the area of RSA listed on the NPL. The NPL listing is fence to fence. The RSA and NASA cleanup programs are separately funded and operated. They coordinate on common programmatic needs such as data sharing, consistent cleanup and technical issues.

In 2001, the EPA, NASA and Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) signed a Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) for the MSFC portion of the site. The FFA integrates both NASA’s RCRA requirements and Superfund requirements. The FFA helps make sure that the parties will fully investigate environmental impacts associated with past and present activities. It also helps ensure that they will take appropriate cleanup actions. The FFA establishes schedules, priorities and enforceable milestones for cleanup activities.

To date, there is not a signed FFA at RSA.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

RSA is a site of technical complexity in part due to its comingled groundwater plumes and complex hydrogeology. EPA is involved to protect human health and the environment and address the contaminants of concern (e.g., solvents, metals, pesticides, perchlorate) which have impacted groundwater, soil and sediments. RSA leads site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and ADEM.

Extensive groundwater contamination in the complex Karst geology of the region presents remedial challenges. In addition to the Interim ROD, RSA developed a facility-wide groundwater monitoring plan to monitor and determine the presence of contaminants in the groundwater that may be leaving the installation and/or coming onto the installation from outside sources.

Site investigation and cleanup activities are ongoing. RSA is currently cleaning up the site in accordance with its RCRA permit. RSA has made progress in remediating sites at the installation and is actively working on high-priority sites.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Initial investigations began in the 1970s with surface media investigations. By the 1990s, groundwater and soil contamination was confirmed in many of the industrial areas. As part of the site cleanup strategy, EPA identified 25 operable units (OUs) at RSA. These OUs refer to different parts of the site. EPA completed six Records of Decisions (RODs) and issued an interim Installation-wide Groundwater ROD to protect human ingestion and exposure to contaminated groundwater until final remedies are established.

- The major parts of the Interim ROD included prohibiting the use of groundwater at the Arsenal for drinking water purposes (including seeps and springs); controlling the use of Arsenal groundwater for non-potable uses in support of the Army’s mission; and initiation of formal coordination with local government agencies who may conduct activities on or off the Arsenal involving potentially contaminated groundwater where the Army is not in control of the action.
- Led by RSA, numerous studies and cleanup actions are underway, including the effort to map and dispose of 17 suspected chemical warfare munitions (CWM) sites.
- At MSFC, there are 9 OUs which include over 80 surface media sites (soil, surface water, and sediment), 5 major groundwater plumes, and 17 source areas related to the contaminated groundwater. EPA completed 3 RODs and issued an interim source area ROD and an Installation-wide Groundwater ROD to protect human ingestion and exposure to contaminated groundwater until final remedies are established. In addition, NASA has completed numerous time-critical removal actions to address immediate risks to human health and the environment. NASA, EPA, and ADEM are collectively working together to address the environmental cleanup at MSFC under the FFA.
