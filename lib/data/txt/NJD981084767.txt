### Background

The Puchack Well Field site is located in Pennsauken, New Jersey. In the 1970s various organic and inorganic contaminants were detected in water collected from wells at the Puchack Well Field. In 1984, due largely to chromium contamination, the general use of the Puchack Well Field was terminated. However, in order to control the chromium plume, pumping at one well was allowed to continue through 1998.

Based on field work by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), EPA and the United States Geological Survey, EPA determined that the chromium contamination originated at a now defunct chromium plating facility near the intersection of Cove and River roads. The discharge from the plating facility first impacted the “Middle Aquifer” underlying the property. The chromium then found its way deeper into the “Intermediate Sand Aquifer” and the “Lower Aquifer” where the contamination eventually impacted the Puchack Well Field’s wells.

In September 2006, EPA decided that the best way to treat the chromium in groundwater was through the direct injection of reagents into the contaminated aquifers. The selected reagent, sodium lactate, converts highly toxic and soluble hexavalent chromium into the far less toxic and relatively insoluble form called trivalent chromium. Phase 1 treatment of the groundwater was completed in November 2013 and Phase 2 is expected to begin in 2018.

In September 2011, EPA decided that a similar approach could be used to clean-up the soil. A reagent (calcium polysulfide) was mixed with the contaminated soil, thus converting the hexavalent chromium to the trivalent form. This will prevent any additional chromium from entering the underlying groundwater.

Unlike the groundwater phases, the soil cleanup was designed and implemented by a “potentially responsible party.” The soil clean up was completed in 2016.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Immediate Actions: The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) initially addressed the site. All of the Puchack Well Field groundwater wells were shut down and removed from service. Residents were connected to the public water supply.

Groundwater: EPA selected the remedy for the site’s chromium-contaminated groundwater plume in the site’s September 2006 Record of Decision, or ROD. It consists of groundwater treatment, long-term groundwater sampling and monitored natural attenuation, and institutional controls to restrict well installations and groundwater use in areas of chromium-contaminated groundwater. A. Groundwater treatment for Phase 1 was completed in 2013, series. Post-injection sampling continued for three years.EPA expects Phase 2 to begin in 2018.

Source Areas: The soil cleanup was completed in 2016.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Because of the nature and complexity of the site, EPA divided the investigation and cleanup into two phases, called operable units. OU1 deals solely with the investigation and cleanup of the chromium contaminated groundwater. OU2 deals with the investigation and clean up of the source areas that are contributing to the groundwater contamination that impacted the Puchack Well Field.

The Record of Decision (ROD) for OU1, was completed in September 2006. In 2008, a pilot study to evaluate an in-situ chrome treatment system for groundwater was completed. The RI/FS for OU2 was completed and a ROD was finalized in 2011. The Remedial Design for OU1 was approved in 2011, and its Phase 1 implementation was completed in 2013, with the associated monitoring completed in 2016..

The site's responsible parties completed the soil remedy in 2016.

After immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, and additional site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in March 1998.
