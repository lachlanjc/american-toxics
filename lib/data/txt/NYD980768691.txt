Background
The 350-acre Colesville Municipal Landfill site is located in Colesville, New York. The Town of Colesville owned and operated the 35-acre landfill from 1965 until 1969, when ownership transferred to Broome County. The landfill accepted about 9,000 tons of municipal waste each year. From 1973 to 1975, industrial wastes, such as organic solvents, dyes and metals were placed in the landfill, resulting in groundwater contamination. The landfill closed in 1984. Two streams collect surface water drainage from the landfill and empty into the Susquehanna River. The New York State Department of Health inspected the site in 1984 and detected volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the groundwater. 
Approximately 1,900 people live within three miles of the site and depend on private wells as their source of drinking water. The closest residence is 300 feet from the site. The area is rural and woodlands surround the landfill. The Susquehanna River is used for fishing and recreational activities.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed in two stages: an initial action and a long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site. . Initial Action: Broome County, a potentially responsible party, provided residents with bottled water or activated charcoal filters for contaminated private wells and monitored the wells quarterly. Long-term Cleanup: In 1991, following a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the nature and extent of the contamination and to evaluate remedial alternatives, EPA selected the remedy in a Record of Decision, or ROD. The selected remedy included capping the landfill, installing a leachate collection system, collecting and treating contaminated groundwater, and providing an alternated water supply system for affected residents. Capping of the landfill and wetlands restoration was completed in 1995. Several of the affected residences were purchased by the County and were demolished. Two new deep wells were installed to provide an alternate water supply to the two affected residences that remained. Based upon a design-related study conducted at the site in 1998, it was determined that extracting contaminated groundwater at the landfill as called for in the ROD would not likely be an effective means of remediatinq the groundwater at the source in a reasonable time frame. Specifically, aquifer tests determined that the aquifer near the landfill has a low permeability, which would severely limit the area of influence of the extraction wells and would allow the groundwater to be pumped at only a very low rate (0.25 to 0.5 gallon per minute). Such conditions would necessitate the installation of an inordinate number of extraction wells. This conclusion led to an evaluation of alternative groundwater technologies and the performance of a pilot-scale study to evaluate the effectiveness of one of the more promising technologies, enhanced reductive dechlorination. This process involves injecting an easily degradable carbohydrate solution (molasses) into the contaminated  groundwater, which provides excess organic carbon that promotes microbial activity in the aquifer, enhancing the breakdown of chlorinated VOCs.  Based upon the results of the pilot study, which showed a significant decline in VOC concentrations, it was concluded that this technology, in combination with the installation of downgradient extraction wells (as called for in the ROD), offered the most technically feasible approach to controlling the migration of contaminated groundwater to ensure that groundwater beyond the property boundary meets groundwater standards. The change to the remedy was documented in a 2000  Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD).   The groundwater management system, as modified by the ESD, became operational in 2002. It consists of 17 automated reagent injection wells, three groundwater recovery wells, and an on-site groundwater treatment system. Molasses was injected every three months until 2012 at which time the extraction wells were shut down and molasses injections were discontinued to conduct an In-Situ Reactive Zone Discontinuation Pilot Study.  The study ended in 2014.  Based upon its review of the results of the pilot study, EPA concluded that the natural attenuation capacity of the aquifer was not sufficient on its own to degrade the VOCs and that resuming molasses injections would enhance the naturally-occuring biodegradation of site contaminants to help the site groundwater achieve cleanup levels. The PRP resumed the molasses injections in 2019, as needed. In 2000, during an inspection of the site, EPA determined that contaminated water from a spring and low-lying wet area in the vicinity of the landfill were discharging to nearby streams. In-situ treatment measures were subsequently implemented to prevent the migration of contaminated water from the spring and low-lying wet area. The implemented actions were documented in a 2004 ESD. PA determined that to ensure the protectiveness of the remedy, an institutional control that requires vapor intrusion sampling to determine whether this pathway is of concern if buildings are constructed in this area in the future or if the nearby vacant houses are occupied, was needed. To that end, letters were sent by EPA to the Broome County Department of Public Works and the Town of Coleville Office of Code Enforcement indicating that EPA and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation should be contacted prior to the approval of any building permits or Certificates of Occupancy for the residential properties in the vicinity of the site that do not have environmental easements and restrictive covenants. Periodic reminders to these agencies are issued. This modification to the remedy was documented in a 2016 ESD.

What Is the Current Site Status?
It is expected that molasses injections will encourage further contaminant degredation and reduce contaminant concentrations. Monitoring will confirm this and will be used to determine whether additional injections are necessary. EPA performed five-year reviews at the site in April 2000, April 2005, April 2010, May 2015, and March 2020. These reviews ensure that the remedy is protect public health and the environment and is functioning as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that the response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health in the short term. protects human health and the environment in the short-term because unacceptable exposure to contaminated media has been interrupted by the implemented remedial actions and has been completed and has addressed all human health and ecological risks and all ICs are in place, preventing unacceptable use of soil and groundwater.   To be protective in the long-term, contaminant trends need to be evaluated to determine whether concentrations are decreasing and whether additional injections are necessary. For the remedy to be protective in the long-term, natural attenuation parameters need to be evaluated to determine if natural attenuation is occurring, the continuing contaminant contributions from the springs into the stream need to be evaluated, sediment sampling/scraping needs to continue and technologies need to be evaluated to address increasing groundwater contaminant concentrations in the vicinity of laandfill perimeter monitoring well﻿. The next five-year review will be by March 2025.
