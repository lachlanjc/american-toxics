### Background

**Current Status**

Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. The third five-year review (FYR) was completed on September 3, 2013. The FYR reveals the site continues to be protective to human health and the environment in the long term. The Fourth Five-Year Review Report is scheduled to begin in early 2018.

**Site Background**

The 12.8-acre D.L. Mud, Inc. site is located about 2.5 miles southwest of Abbeville, Louisiana. The area was originally part of a 25.6-acre parcel of land used as a drilling mud facility until 1986. The remaining portion of the 25.6-acre parcel is now known as the Gulf Coast Vacuum Services Superfund site. While the facility was open, operators used large tanks and surface impoundments to mix and store raw materials and waste. The types of wastes generated, stored or disposed of at the site were defined as “non-hazardous oilfield wastes,” which can contain hazardous substances. Site activities and waste disposal practices contaminated soil with hazardous chemicals.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through PRP actions.  
  
EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires additional investigation, analysis and coordination efforts between the Gulf Coast Vacuum Services and D.L. Mud sites to determine the source of persistent exceedances of maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) at well G-21, and an explanation for increasing concentrations of manganese and chromium at the site. Additionally, the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP) must complete an operation and maintenance plan for EPA’s review and approval.

In 1981, The Dowell Division of The Dow Chemical Company (Dow) purchased a 12.8-acre portion of the parcel that contained the barium sulfate-based drilling mud blending operation. Ownership of the D.L. Mud site transferred to Dowell Schlumberger, Inc. (DSI) in 1984, and the property was sold to D.L. Mud in 1985. D.L. Mud went out of business in 1986. Currently, the site in not in use.In 1981, The Dowell Division of The Dow Chemical Company (Dow) purchased a 12.8-acre portion of the parcel that contained the barium sulfate-based drilling mud blending operation.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long term remedy included excavation and off-site disposal of visually contaminated subsurface soil, institutional controls, and groundwater monitoring. Remedy construction took place between 1998 and 1999. Site maintenance and groundwater monitoring activities are ongoing.  
  
Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2000.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions in 1983 included removing drums containing various wastes; cleaning up, packing and disposing of spilled materials; regrading the site; and constructing a levee around an on-site tank farm. A removal action in 1987 included disposal of 1.3 million pounds of tank contents, 14,800 gallons of tank liquids and associated contaminated soil; decontamination and demolition of tanks; excavation and disposal of 800 cubic yards of contaminated soil; and placement of clean fill over excavated areas.
