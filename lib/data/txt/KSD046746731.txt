Background
The 2.5-acre Ace Services Site is a former chrome plating facility in Colby, Kansas, where chrome plating was applied to farm implements. From 1969 to 1975, chrome plating wastewater generated during operations at the Ace Services facility was discharged directly to the ground surface immediately west of a tributary to Prairie Dog Creek.  A local citizen filed a complaint with the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) in early 1971. KDHE and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency collected wastewater samples in 1971 and 1972 that showed the presence of chromium. In 1974 and 1975, Ace services installed concrete retention vats and an evaporation lagoon was built to receive discharged wastewater. The evaporations lagoon was not lined. Chromium contaminated wastewater leaking from the retention vats and seeping from the unlined lagoon contaminated the soil, and ultimately the ground water. Lead contamination was also present at the site, presumably from releases of lead chromate, which is formed when lead anodes are used in the plating process.
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In 1988, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment issued an Administrative Order requiring Ace Services to clean up the site. The work required by this order was not completed and in 1992, the KDHE coordinated the removal of plating wastes. In 1994, the EPA conducted a removal effort to clean up the contaminated soils and concrete, and structures at the site. The Ace Services site was proposed for inclusion on the EPA's National Priorities List (NPL) in 1995.  A Record of Decision describing the remedial response actions for the site was issued by the EPA in 1999. The ROD was amended in September of 2001. The site is divided into two Operable Units. OU1 included decontamination of the plating and machine shop buildings by removal of the concrete floor surfaces and cleaning of all other interior surfaces. OU2 included the demolition of existing buildings in order to construct an on-site groundwater treatment plant in their place and allow for removal of contaminated soil. An optimization study was conducted in 2007 by the EPA with the goal of accelerating the cleanup of the groundwater plume. As a result of this study a shallow well, which historically had high concentrations of chromium, was converted to an extraction well.  A second optimization study was initiated by the EPA in 2012. The recommendation from an EPA Headquarters contractor was to increase pumping of extraction wells upgradient near the groundwater treatment plant and decrease pumping rates from the downgradient to the upgradient direction until chromium concentrations are below the action level. These optimization recommendations have been implemented. In addition, an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) was issued by the EPA to implement additional optimization recommendations. The 2012 ESD included recontouring and capping of a 32,000-square-foot area with a geosynthetic membrane covered by additional soil and vegetation. This action was conducted to address remaining contaminated soil at depth in the area of the former waste lagoon which received stormwater drainage. The Third Five-Year Review conducted by the EPA found the Ace Services site to be protective in the short term and stated that the need for additional institutional controls on the property would be evaluated. In August 2019, the EPA issued an ESD. All work that was included in the 1999 ROD, the 2001 ROD Amendment, and the 2012 ESD remain the same except that the 2019 ESD memorializes a final decision to remove institutional controls, or ICs, in the form of deed restrictions on properties over and near the contamination plume, not including the site itself, as part of the groundwater remedy for the site. This requirement is being eliminated due to sufficient controls in place to prevent the use of contaminated groundwater as a potable water supply. The Fourth Five-Year Review was completed in September of 2023 and the remedy is currently protective.
What Is the Current Site Status?
An ion exchange groundwater treatment system was constructed and is in operation. Groundwater is monitored semi-annually. Exposure pathways to groundwater have been removed through connection of private wells to the city water system and institutional control in the form of a permit requirement by the city for installation of new wells. The site property is zoned light industrial. In April 2014, the site was transitioned to the operations and maintenance phase that is conducted by the KDHE.  In 2018, the Third Five-Year Review found the Ace Services site OU2 to be protective in the short term and stated that the need for additional institutional controls on the property would be evaluated. OU1 is complete, and the buildings have been demolished so OU1 was not evaluated. Since the Third Five-Year Review, additional samples were collected to deterimine if additional plume contaminant efforts are necessary and the State has continued upgradient investigations to determine if upgradient contamination impacted the site. In August 2019, the deed restriction requirement was eliminated because sufficient controls are in place to prevent exposure and a notice of contamination would provide sufficient notice to potential purchasers of the Site about contamination at the Site. In 2023, the Fourth Five-Year Review found the OU2 to be protective in the short term. Further evaluation of the long-term protectiveness is being done to determine if optimization of the Site remedy is effective for future protectiveness. OU1 is complete, and the buildings have been demolished so OU1 was not evaluated.
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
The site is currently zoned as light industrial by the city of Colby, Kansas and future use of the site area is expected to continue to be light industrial and/or commercial. ICs have been implemented for the Site through public education and warnings about the use of the groundwater in the contaminated plume area. Colby city statute 15-103 prohibits new wells and prevents inappropriate use of groundwater. The 2019 Explanation of Significant Differences removed the deed restrictions on properties over/near the contamination plume, including the Site itself, and determined that an IC informational device such as a deed notice or other appropriate mechanism would be adequately protective as it will provide potential buyers of the site with notice of the contamination and will inform potential buyers of site usages that should be avoided to prevent exposure to the contamination. The deed restriction requirement was eliminated because sufficient controls are in place to prevent exposure to contaminated soil and the use of contaminated groundwater as a potable water supply. The EPA recorded notices of contamination regarding the site with the Thomas County Recorder of Deeds on July 8, 2019.
Sampling and Monitoring
Recent elevated chromium groundwater concentrations and the increasing chromium concentration trends in MW-15S, MW-18S, and MW-18S may require additional downgradient monitoring and/or considerations for preventing contaminant migration. If increasing chromium concentrations are found in MW-19S and MW-19i in the future, reassessment of the extraction system’s capture zone and/or monitoring well network may be become necessary.
