### Background

The 632-acre Memphis Defense Depot (Depot) is located in Memphis, Tennessee. It is a former warehousing and distribution center for the U.S. military where waste handling and disposal occurred. Releases of chemicals from the wastes that were released on site resulted in contaminated soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment. In 1992, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL). EPA, the Tennessee Department of Environment & Conservation (TDEC) and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) have undertaken investigations and cleanup actions to protect human health and the environment.

Significant progress in reducing contaminant concentrations in groundwater and soil have been made. The parties are currently evaluating additional cleanup activities to prevent migration and restore groundwater. No one at the Depot or off site is exposed to the contaminated groundwater. The DoD, EPA and TDEC continue to ensure the protectiveness of the site’s remedy through long-term monitoring of groundwater, land use controls and the required Five-Year Reviews of remedy performance and overall site protectiveness.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Depot is located at 2163 Airways Boulevard in Memphis, Tennessee. The Depot covers 642 acres in a mixed residential, commercial and industrial area of south-central Memphis. The surrounding area’s population is largely African-American and economically disadvantaged. The Depot consists of two adjacent areas:

1. Main Installation: An intensively developed 578-acre area with open storage space, warehouses, former military family housing and outdoor recreational areas.
2. Dunn Field: An approximately 60-acre open storage and waste burial area.

The Depot is surrounded by small commercial and manufacturing businesses to the north and east and by single-family residences to the south and west. Operations at the Depot began in 1942; the installation provided supplies, including clothing, food, medical supplies, electronic equipment, petroleum products and industrial chemicals, to the U.S. military. Hazardous substances were used and stored on site as part of Depot operations, resulting in soil and ground water contamination from leakage, spillage, disposal of out-of-date materials and normal application of pesticides. In 1946, the U.S. Army disposed of leaking mustard bombs at Dunn Field. Other wastes disposed of at the Depot included oil, grease, paint thinners, methyl bromide, pesticides and cleaning fluids. Storage and distribution of material continued until the facility closed in September 1997. Environmental assessment activities at the Depot began in the 1980s. The Depot was placed on EPA’s National Priorities List of contaminated sites in 1992. EPA, TDEC and DLA worked collaboratively with DRC throughout the 2000s to enable the Depot’s cleanup, environmental restoration and reuse.

- In 1995, EPA, TDEC and the Depot entered into a Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) with DoD’s Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) that outlined the process for site investigation and cleanup under EPA’s Superfund program. DLA, a DoD agency and the former operator of the Depot, was the lead agency for cleanup and restoration activities.
- In December 2010, the DoD assumed responsibility from DLA for remaining environmental restoration activities. DoD maintains overall responsibility for site cleanup and long-term stewardship, with oversight provided by EPA and TDEC.
- In 2010, DoD completed the construction of the remedy and met EPA’s Sitewide Ready for Anticipated Use criteria. Operation and maintenance activities and long-term monitoring are ongoing. Land use controls (LUCs) have been established for both the Main Installation and Dunn Field; compliance with LUCs is monitored and reported annually to ensure that only appropriate land uses are located at the Depot.
- The DoD, TDEC and EPA completed the third Five-Year Review for the site in 2013. It found that the cleanup continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires updates to the groundwater remedy and additional monitoring. In the interim, exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks are being controlled. LUCs are preventing exposure to, or the ingestion of, contaminants of concern.
- In November 2012, enhanced bioremediation treatments were restarted and continued through 2013; in addition, DoD, EPA and TDEC are currently reevaluating timeframe estimates for groundwater to achieve site cleanup goals.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA and TDEC have addressed site contamination under both the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and Superfund. Since early 2005, all activities have taken place under the authority of the Superfund program.

EPA has divided the site into four areas, or operable units (OUs): OU-1, Dunn Field; OU-2, the former industrial area; OU-3, the southeastern watershed and golf course; and OU-4, the former material storage area.

Three EPA-approved cleanup plans (Records of Decision, or RODs) have addressed all contaminants of concern, enabling the site to be returned to productive use.

Groundwater treatment and long-term monitoring activities at the Main Installation and Dunn Field are ongoing. Additional delineation of the extent of groundwater contamination at the Main Installation, along with expansion of the treatment areas and alternative technologies, are being considered by the DoD, TDEC and EPA to address contaminated groundwater migration and accelerate the cleanup schedule. The next Five-Year Review of cleanup progress at the Depot was required in January 2018 and EPA comments to the report has been submitted to the Army for review.

### Enforcement Information

In 1995, EPA, TDEC and the Depot entered into an FFA with DLA that outlined the process for investigation and cleanup activities at the Depot under the Superfund program.
