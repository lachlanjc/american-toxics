### Background

The Waste Management of Wisconsin, Inc. (Brookfield Sanitary Landfill) site is located in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Waste Management operated a 20-acre sanitary landfill at the site from 1969 to 1981. In 1976, the company received a permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to accept municipal waste. The site was recapped in the late 1980s with ongoing gas extraction. In 1985, monitoring found site groundwater was contaminated with cyanide. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site has been addressed through state, federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources is overseeing the cleanup. Waste Management placed a new clay cap on the landfill in 1988 to meet current regulatory standards. The cap has been properly graded and vegetated and does not show signs of erosion. Drainage ditches carry excess runoff away from the site. Landfill gas is extracted and destroyed using a flare. Gas probes currently monitor methane levels and gas pressure.

Construction of the remedy finished in 1991. The remedy eliminates the principal threat posed by the site by preventing direct contact with contaminated materials, venting landfill gases and greatly reducing water flow through the waste.

The facility is currently under WDNR's Closure Long-Term Care Plan. Wisconsin Statute 504.07 par. 9 prohibits any use of a closed facility unless WDNR approves such use in writing. Additional on-site gas probes were installed in December 2003 along the western boundary, due to proposed development in that area. The site owner is investigating the extent of the groundwater plume that extends to the southeast.
