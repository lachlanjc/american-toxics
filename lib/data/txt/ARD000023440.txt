Background
﻿Background The 193-acre Vertac, Inc. Superfund Site (the Site) is located at 1907 Hill Road in the City of Jacksonville, Pulaski County, Arkansas, and is approximately 15 miles northeast of Little Rock. The Site includes two areas, known as Parcel 1 and Parcel 2, which Vertac Chemical Corporations acquired at different times. Parcel 1 includes the former central process area and is approximately 93-acres. Parcel 2 boarders the northern boundary of Parcel 1 and consist of 100-acres. Parcel 2 did not include production facilities; however, the parcel was used by the former facility as drum storage. Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) did use Parcel 2 of the Site for staging and cleanup activities during remedial activities for the Site. The City of Jacksonville later acquired Parcel 2 and this portion of the Site was redeveloped as a recycling center, a dog park, police department facilities, and fire training facilities. Site operations led to the contamination of soil, sediment, debris, surface water, and groundwater. The potentially responsible party (PRP), Hercules, is responsible for Site maintenance, groundwater monitoring, and operations of the groundwater treatment system. EPA oversees the operation by the PRP, and as an added layer of precaution, EPA conducts five-year reviews (FYRs). FYRs are conducted every five years from when the initial remedy was constructed to ensure the Site remedies remain protective of human health and the environment. A total of six FYRs have been conducted with the Sixth FYR Report completed on September 23, 2024. It is important to note that the Fifth FYR Report (2019) deferred protectiveness, which indicates a FYR Addendum may occur prior to the subsequent FYR.  Prior to the Sixth FYR Report (2024), a Five-year Review Addendum Report was completed on March 27, 2024. Site History  The Site has served a multitude of former industrial processes. During the 1930s and 1940s, the onsite portion of the Site was first developed by the federal government as a for munitions complex, for the World War II Arkansas Ordinance Plant. The munitions complex was built in the location of the former central process area with the complex extending beyond the present Site boundary. Following the decommissioning of the Arkansas Ordinance Plant, the Site was utilized by different companies which produced herbicides and/or pesticides from the late 1940s to late 1980s. In 1948, the Reasor-Hill Company purchased the Site and used it to manufacture insecticides and herbicides. The insecticides used were 1,1,1-trichlor-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT), aldrin, dieldrin, and toxaphene. The herbicides manufactured included 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), and 2,4,5- trichlorophenoxypropionic acid (2,4,5-TP or Silvex). The production of 2,4,5-T results in TCDD as a contaminant. In 1961, Hercules Powder Company, known as Hercules, Inc. (Hercules), bought the Reasor-Hill facility and continued the manufacturing and formulation of herbicides. From 1964 to 1968, Hercules produced a herbicide known as Agent Orange. Agent Orange is a mixture composed of equal amounts of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Similar to the 2,4,5-T production, TCDD is a contaminant in the production of Agent Orange. In 1971, Hercules discontinued operations at the Site, but from 1971 to 1976, Hercules leased the plant to Transvaal, Inc. (Transvaal). Transvaal produced 2,4-D and intermittently 2,4,5-T. Transvaal later bought the facility from Hercules in 1976. In 1978, Transvaal underwent bankruptcy and was reorganized to Vertac Chemical Corporation (Vertac). Vertac operated the plant until 1986. In 1979, ADEE-DEQ (Arkansas Department of Energy and the Environment, Division of Environmental Quality; known as Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology (ADPC&E) at the time) and EPA began what would become more than a decade of enforcement and cleanup activities including six phases of response actions. The Site was added to the national properties list (NPL) on September 8, 1983.  Remedial actions were completed by late 1998. National Priorities Listing (NPL) History

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
EPA divided the Site into four areas, or operable units (OUs), for cleanup. The OUs are: (1) the  Offsite Areas OU, which includes releases to areas outside of the former Vertac facility boundary, including Rocky Branch Creek, the east and west leg, and its corresponding floodplain, Bayou Meto, and offsite residential soils known as South Residential Area; (2) OU1: Onsite Above Ground Onsite Aboveground Media/Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C landfill (OU1 landfill), the former facility buildings and other aboveground contaminated media used by the former facility; (3) OU2: Onsite Surface and Subsurface Soils, later including a portion of offsite residential soils known as Jacksonville Residential Area or East Residential Area, and (4) OU3: groundwater contamination. Health Considerations
Contamination at the Site is being addressed through federal, state and PRP actions. EPA has conducted several FYRs of the Site’s remedy. These FYRs evaluate the existing remedies for each OU to ensure each remedy functions as intended by the respective decision documents and to ensure the protection of human health and the environment. The most recent review, the Sixth FYR Report (2024), concluded that response actions at OU1 and OU3 are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and the remedy at these OUs continues to be protective of human health and the environment. However, residential soils associated with Offsite Areas OU and OU2 are not protective; and therefore, the Site is not protective until residential soils associated with Offsite Areas OU and OU2 are addressed. OU3 and OU1 are under operation and maintenance by Hercules, the PRP, and EPA and ADEE-DEQ are responsible for ensuring that the work is performed adequately. Exposure pathways at OU1 and OU3 are under control. The contaminated groundwater is the within the fractured Atoka Formation and is contained to the former facility boundary by a French drain and groundwater extraction wells. The onsite contaminated groundwater is not used, and no groundwater supply wells are located within a half mile of the Site. Potable water for the surrounding area is provided by the City of Jacksonville public water supply. OU1 RCRA Subtitle C Landfill is capped and continues to meet Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements (ARARs). Offsite Areas OU and OU2 pose potential dioxin risk to residents and recreators. Affected residential soils are to the south and east of the former facility boundary. EPA is updating the relevant decision documents to ensure the protection of human health. Soil remedial action activities are being conducted by Hercules under EPA oversight. Additionally, during this time, EPA is working with Hercules, Hercules’ contractors, state, and local stakeholders to communicate with affected property owners. Communications with affected property owners are ongoing. Communication methods include door-to-door activities, mailed letters, and distribution of factsheets.

What Is the Current Site Status?
In 2012, EPA published a reassessment of the oral non-cancer toxicity value, or reference dose (RfD), for dioxin and subsequently revised the risk-based screening levels. The revised screening level is 51 parts per trillion (ppt) for dioxin in residential soils and 720 ppt for dioxin in industrial/commercial soils. At the time of the cleanup in the 1990s, the risk-based cleanup level for dioxins in soils for residential and agricultural areas was 1 part per billion (ppb) (this is equal to 1,000 ppt), and 5 ppb (5,000 ppt) for industrial/commercial areas. Soil contaminated with dioxin above the cleanup levels at the time was removed. Respectively, soils below the cleanup level did not warrant cleanup. Areas where residential soil cleanup did not occur in the 1990s (dioxin values <1,000 ppt) were sampled in May 2023 and February 2024. The results of the May 2023 soil sampling event indicated values both above and below the current residential screening level of 51 ppt. Values above 51 ppt indicate potential human health risk and further sampling was conducted to determine extent of contamination. Additional sampling was conducted in February 2024 and also indicated values above 51 ppt. A risk evaluation was performed, which indicated there is unacceptable human health risk present from exposure to residential soils where dioxin was found to be above 51 ppt and 51 ppt was selected as the preliminary remediation goal for residential soils. EPA is working with local state agencies, the PRP, Hercules, and Hercules’ subcontractor to address residential properties where dioxin is above 51 ppt. EPA and Hercules’ are working directly with affected property owners and are finalizing a soil remedial action workplan. Additionally, EPA has drafted a decision document to revise the cleanup level to 51 ppt. The draft decision document is under review. Once the decision document is final, it will become publicly available.
