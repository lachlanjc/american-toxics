Background
Summary The Federated Metals Corporation (FMC) site is a former metal smelting, refining, recovery, and recycling facility, that operated nearly 50 years in Hammond, Indiana along the shore of Lake George.   After operations ceased at FMC, the corporation sold the manufacturing buildings and partially performed an EPA-required cleanup on site but filed for bankruptcy and abandoned the facility before the work was completed.  A bankruptcy Trust was established to finish the EPA-required work at the smelter, but no Trust funds were available to investigate soil contamination in the surrounding neighborhoods. EPA’s Superfund program then performed a limited removal action to remove lead-contaminated soil from “priority” yards in the surrounding neighborhood. History From 1937 through 1983, FMC operated a 36-acre smelting, refining, recovery and recycling facility along the border of Hammond and Whiting, Indiana. Historically, such smelter operations often emitted lead and other heavy metals from the facilities’ stack, baghouse, and waste piles. In 1985, FMC sold the smelter manufacturing facilities that comprised a 17-acre portion of the facility to HBR Partnership.  Subsequently, other businesses, including Northern Indiana Metals and Whiting Metals purchased the 17-acre parcel and continued to conduct smelting operations off and on until 2020.   Back in 1992, FMC and its parent corporation, ASARCO, entered into a federal consent decree to settle an EPA lawsuit alleging RCRA hazardous waste violations, and agreed to perform RCRA Corrective Action across the entire 36-acre smelter property, not just the 19 acres that FMC still owned. The Corrective Action involved consolidating slag dredged from adjacent Lake George with contaminated soils excavated from facility production areas, and non-hazardous baghouse demolition debris into an existing on-site landfill on the property. The landfill included a “phyto-cap” feature designed to use plants and trees to reduce landfill contaminants from leaching into the groundwater. In 2005, before the corrective action work was completed, ASARCO declared bankruptcy and abandoned the FMC facility. Four years later, in 2009, a bankruptcy settlement agreement established a Trust that took title to the 10-acre landfill and 9-acre area undergoing Corrective Action. The Trust completed the landfill cover, installed additional groundwater monitoring wells, and conducted several rounds of on-site and off-site groundwater sampling to confirm that the landfill cap was preventing groundwater contamination. However, no Trust funds remained to investigate potential releases of contaminants to the surrounding neighborhood.  Consequently, EPA’s Superfund program initiated an investigation of the neighborhood yards and excavated those yards that were most heavily contaminated with lead.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
From 2001 to 2006, the smelter property was subject to a $3.35 million federal Resource Conservation & Recovery Act (RCRA) corrective action/Indiana State RCRA closure project that is nearly complete. This work included demolition of an on-site baghouse; consolidation of debris, on-site hazardous wastes and slag dredged from Lake George into the landfill; and construction of a phyto-cap, a remedy technology which consists of growing selected plants and trees on top of a landfill. In December 2005, ASARCO declared bankruptcy and abandoned the site before the RCRA corrective action was completed. A federal bankruptcy court ultimately allocated $1.2 million to a federal Trustee to complete the corrective action. The Trustee has spent about half of the funds originally given by the bankruptcy court to complete the RCRA corrective action at the Federated Metals landfill, consisting primarily of landfill cap maintenance and groundwater monitoring. This RCRA corrective action work is still ongoing. At the request of EPA’s RCRA program, in late 2016 and early 2017 EPA’s Superfund Division sampled soils at city-owned properties and rights-of-way in Hammond and Whiting to determine if heavy metals from the former Federated Metals Corporation (FMC) facility had contaminated the surrounding residential areas. The results showed some lead and arsenic contamination at unoccupied properties in the community. In May 2017, EPA sampled the former facility’s landfill to determine whether contamination found in the community is from the former smelter.  The analysis showed a link between materials found in the landfill and materials found in the soils to the north of the site. These combined endeavors led EPA to define a new soil sampling area that included occupied residential properties. In October 2017, EPA along with the cities of Hammond and Whiting informed local residents of a sampling study taking place in residential properties to obtain a better understanding of the levels of arsenic and lead in the soil. The results showed that the soil in some of the properties sampled had lead above EPA’s Removal Management Levels or RMLs. RMLs help identify, areas, contaminants and conditions where a removal action may be appropriate. In May 2018 EPA held a public meeting at the Whiting Family YMCA to share with community members the activities taking place near the Federated Metals Corp. site (PDF) (1﻿ pp, 20 MB). Later that same month, EPA began excavating soil at priority properties in the sampling area (PDF) (1 pg, 841 K). EPA collected soil samples from 242 properties in the vicinity of the former Federated Metals plant to determine the extent of historic lead contamination in the area. The assessment found 163 residential yards that had soil lead levels above EPA’s health standard. Residential soil sampling data is available. From 2018 to 2019 EPA performed a short-term removal action excavating lead-contaminated soils in 33 priority residential properties in Whiting and Hammond. These priority properties were properties where surface lead levels were equal to or exceeded 1,200 parts lead per million parts soil, and where sensitive populations lived. For this project, sensitive population was defined as pregnant women, and children under seven. In August of 2021, the City of Hammond began a project to remove and dispose of lead-contaminated soil in Hammond properties affected by the site. In early 2023, the City of Hammond informed EPA that 47 residential yards were cleaned up. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
On September 6, 2023 EPA issued a press release announcing the addition of the Federated Metals Corp Whiting site in Hammond, Indiana to the Superfund National Priorities List. EPA conducted a 60-day public comment period from March 27 to May 30, 2023 proposing to add the site to the NPL and published a Support Document (PDF) (34 pp, 1.6MB) with responses to the public comments received. On October 18, 2023, EPA held a public meeting at Whiting High School to formally announce the addition of the site into the NPL. The meeting presentation (PDF) (25 pp, 2.55 MB) included an overview of the procedures to add the site into the NPL, the remedial process, community involvement activities, and information regarding lead health hazards and an upcoming site health assessment by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). On November 15, 2023, EPA provided a Superfund Process training (PDF) (45 pp, 2.55 MB) session followed by an Open House at the Whiting High School as part of EPA’s ongoing outreach activities. In September 2024 EPA published the Community Involvement Plan (PDF) (80 pp, 24.7 MB), or CIP, to help inform, engage, and support the communities affected by the site. This CIP also supports environmental and cleanup activities at and near the site. EPA used several information sources to develop this plan, including research, discussions with community members and information gathered at community interviews in December of 2023. Top of Page
