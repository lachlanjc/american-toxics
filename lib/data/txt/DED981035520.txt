### Background

The Sealand Limited Superfund site covers a 0.8-acre area in Middletown, Delaware. Sealand Limited and Oil Industry operated a creosote-manufacturing plant and a coal tar, gas tar, and ink oil storage and recycling facility on the site for approximately one year, closing in 1983. Leaking tanks and drums at the site contaminated ground water and soil. EPA added the site to the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1990, and after cleanup, deleted the site from the NPL in 1997.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA conducted two five-year reviews of the site's remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place continue to protect public health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent reveiw concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA. The remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. No additional five-year reviews are required.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site's long-term remedy, selected in 1991, included a decision of "No Further Action" because the site no longer posed a threat to hman health and the environment after the short-term cleanup was completed. The EPA deleted the site from the Superfund National Priorities List in 1997.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Removal actions, or short-term cleanups, addressed immediate threats to human health and the environment. These actions included the removal of 240,000 gallons of coal tar, 320 drums and 122 cubic yards of solid waste from the site. Removal actions also included the cleaning and off-site disposal of waste oil storage tanks and the capping of the drum storage area, as well as monitoring well installation and monitoring.
