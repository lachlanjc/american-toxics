Background
The Valley Park TCE Superfund Site is located in the eastern portion of the city of Valley Park, approximately 15 miles southwest of the city of St. Louis, in St. Louis County, Missouri. The site consists of two source areas, the former Wainwright Industries and current Valley Technologies properties, and two contaminated groundwater plumes within the Meramec River alluvial aquifer resulting from each source area. The Site consists of the following four operable units: OU01 - Wainwright Remedial Soil OU02 - Valley Technologies Soil OU03 - Wainwright Remedial Groundwater OU04 - Valley Technologies Groundwater OU01 addresses the soil contamination in an area within and adjacent to the property formerly owned by Wainwright Industries at 224 Benton Street. OU02 addresses the soil contamination within and adjacent to the property currently owned by Valley Technologies at 555 St. Louis Avenue. OU03 addresses groundwater contamination attributable to Wainwright Industries, and OU04 addresses the groundwater contamination attributable to Valley Technologies. Wainwright Industries owned and operated a metal stamping and tool and die shop at the property located on the northwest corner of the intersection of Benton Street and Third Street from 1949 to 1979. Part of the manufacturing process included a solvent degreasing system that used the solvents Trichloroethylene (TCE) from 1963 to 1970 and Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) from 1970 to 1979. These operations resulted in PCE and TCE contamination in soil and groundwater. Wainwright Industries ceased operations at the facility in 1979, and several other non-manufacturing businesses have been housed at the property since then. Beginning in 1954, Valley Technologies operated two divisions in Valley Park, Missouri, Precision Forgings and Valley Heat Treat, until it began operating solely as Valley Technologies in the early 2000s. Precision Forgings manufactured aluminum pressings and Valley Heat Treat provided heat treatment services on metal parts. Valley Technologies still operates a metal processing facility at the OU02 source area. Past operations by Valley Technologies resulted in TCE contamination in soil and groundwater. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Remedial Action (OU01 and OU03) Original Remedy (OU01 and OU03) The Record of Decision (ROD) for the selection of the remedial actions at OU01 and OU03 was issued in September 29, 1994. The major components of the selected remedies at OU01 and OU03 include the following: soil vapor extraction of contaminated soil; excavation and off-site disposal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contaminated surface soils; a groundwater extraction and treatment system with air stripping; air sparging was initially selected but subsequently removed; institutional controls; and groundwater monitoring. Following the OU01 and OU03 ROD, an explanation of significant differences dated April 2, 1996, was issued to make the following changes to the remedies: treated groundwater could be discharged into the storm sewers rather than the sanitary sewers; air sparging would be eliminated; excavated soils would be treated onsite by ex situ soil vapor extraction rather than in situ soil vapor extraction; and contaminated soil would be excavated, treated and buried on-site or transported to an off-site facility, as opposed to being excavated and hauled off-site for treatment. Construction of the soil remedy at OU01 began in April 1999. By June 1999, approximately 600 cubic yards of contaminated soil were excavated, treated with ex situ soil vapor extraction and placed back into the excavation once cleanup levels were attained. An in situ soil vapor extraction system was installed and began operating in the fall of 1999. The groundwater remedy was constructed along with the soil remedy, and the groundwater extraction and treatment system and the in situ soil vapor extraction system were started together in 1999. In December 1999, MoDNR discovered methyl tertiary-butyl ether during routine sampling of the influent groundwater entering the groundwater extraction and treatment system. As a result, both systems were shut off, and the design of the groundwater extraction and treatment system was modified. The modified design was approved in July 2003. The in situ soil vapor extraction system and groundwater extraction and treatment system were restarted in August 2003 and have operated intermittently since that time. Amended Remedy (OU01 and OU03) On November 16, 2020, the EPA issued a ROD Amendment to change the OU01 and OU03 ROD, as modified by the explanation of significant differences. The OU01 and OU03 ROD Amendment changed the remedial action objectives at OU01 and OU03. The previous remedial action objectives for OU01 and OU03 were to: (1) eliminate the soil source contaminating the groundwater; and (2) hydraulically control and eliminate the groundwater contamination located at the WOU. The ROD Amendment changed the remedial action objectives for OU01 and OU03 to the following: Prevent human exposure to contaminants of concern in surface soil through ingestion, dermal contact and inhalation above levels that are protective of non-residential use on the former Wainwright property; Prevent human exposure to contaminants of concern in surface soil through ingestion, dermal contact and inhalation above levels that are protective of residential use in the residential area; Prevent human exposure to contaminants of concern in groundwater through ingestion, dermal contact and inhalation above levels that are protective of human health; Prevent migration of contaminants of concern from soil to groundwater above levels that are protective of human health; and Restore contaminated groundwater to levels that allow for beneficial use as a drinking water source. The ROD Amendment also changed the soil remedy at OU01, as modified by the explanation of significant differences, to the following: Original Remedy - Soil Remedy at OU01 Soil Vapor Extraction of soil contaminated with Volatile Organic Compounds Amended Remedy - Soil Remedy at OU01 Thermal Treatment with Soil Vapor Extraction The groundwater remedy at OU03 was not changed. The existing groundwater extraction and treatment system will continue to treat the contaminated groundwater plume, and mitigation systems will continue operating to address the vapor intrusion pathway. Vapor Intrusion (OU01 and OU03) Beginning in 2014, a vapor intrusion assessment was conducted at OU01 and OU03 by collecting indoor air samples and collocated crawlspace or subslab air samples from the residence, office areas and warehouse on the site property. The results of the air sampling indicated that vapor intrusion was adversely impacting occupants of the residence and office areas, and mitigation systems were installed in the two buildings. After systems were installed, indoor air samples were collected to confirm the effectiveness of the systems. The results of the confirmation sampling indicate that the mitigation systems are effective in reducing concentrations to below levels of concern. Remedial Action (OU02 and OU04) Original Remedy (OU02 and OU04) The ROD for the selection of the remedial actions at OU02 and OU04 was issued on September 26, 2001. The major components of the selected remedy for OU02 and OU04 include the following: excavation of shallow soils to a depth of 16 feet or less and treatment using ex situ soil vapor extraction; in situ soil vapor extraction to remediate deep contaminated soils below 16 feet; groundwater extraction and treatment with air stripping; air emission controls on commercial wells; institutional controls; and groundwater monitoring. Following the OU02 and OU04 ROD, the EPA issued the an explanation of significant differences dated August 16, 2005, to document the following changes: off-site disposal of excavated soils replaced ex situ soil vapor extraction treatment; air emission controls on commercial wells were eliminated; and treated groundwater would be discharged to a storm sewer and not reinjected into the aquifer. The EPA began construction activities at OU02 and OU04 in fall 2005. By January 2006, the soil excavation on the Valley Technologies property was completed with approximately 5,000 cubic yards of contaminated soils sent to permitted landfills. By August 2006, construction was completed on the treatment building, soil vapor extraction wells, groundwater monitoring wells and the groundwater extraction well. After the initial construction, the in situ soil vapor extraction wells could not pull air from the subsurface and were redeveloped in the spring of 2007. The well redevelopment did not fix the issue, and the soil vapor extraction system has sat idle since that time. The in situ soil vapor extraction system has never operated successfully, and an alternative approach was needed to address contamination in unsaturated soil below 16 feet below grade surface. The groundwater extraction and treatment system has operated, as designed, to generally reduce contamination in groundwater, but levels of groundwater contamination at monitoring wells, located on the Valley Technologies property, have remained unexpectedly high and persistent. The monitoring wells are located in areas that were excavated and backfilled with clean soil. These continued high levels of contamination in groundwater indicate the potential for additional soil source contamination that were not previously identified during the first remedial investigation. Amended Remedy (OU02) The EPA issued the OU02 ROD Amendment dated September 30, 2019, to change the soil remedy in the OU02 ROD, as modified by the explanation of significant differences, to the following: Original Remedy (OU02) Zone A Excavation of shallow soils to a depth of 16 feet or less and off-site disposal (completed in 2006); in situ soil vapor extraction to remediate deep contaminated soils below 16 feet below grade surface Zone B Not addressed in OU02 ROD Amended Remedy (OU02) Zone A In Situ Thermal Remediation to remediate deep contaminated soils below 16 feet down to 25 feet  below grade surface Zone B In Situ Thermal Remediation to remediate contaminated soil down to 37 feet below grade surface Vapor Intrusion (OU02 and OU04) The EPA conducted a vapor intrusion assessment at OU02 and OU04 by collecting indoor air and collocated crawlspace or subslab air samples from residences and businesses near and downgradient of the two source areas. The vapor intrusion assessment began in August 2012 and is ongoing. The EPA continues to conduct assessments at area properties, as needed, to ensure residents are not impacted by site contaminants through the vapor intrusion pathway. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
Five-Year Reviews The EPA conducts Five-Year Reviews to evaluate the protectiveness for remedial actions where hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants remain above levels that allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. The fifth and most recent FYR was completed on September 8, 2023. The EPA issued the following protectiveness statements: OU01 Protectiveness Statement: The remedy at OU01 currently protects human health and the environment because the in situ soil vapor extraction of contaminated soil, excavation and off-site disposal of surface soil contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and institutional controls prevent exposure to contaminated soil. However, for the remedy to be protective in the long-term, the remedial design/remedial action for the Amended Remedy (Thermal Treatment) from ROD Amendment dated November 16, 2020, should be implemented. OU02 Protectiveness Statement: The remedy at OU02 currently protects human health and the environment because excavation of shallow contaminated soils and institutional controls prevent exposure to contaminated soil. However, for the remedy to be protective in the long-term, the remedial action for the Amended Remedy at OU02 (In Situ Thermal Remediation) from the ROD Amendment dated September 30, 2019, should be implemented. OU03 Protectiveness Statement: The remedy at OU03 currently protects human health and the environment because the groundwater extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater, groundwater monitoring and institutional controls prevent exposure to contaminated groundwater. However, for the remedy to be protective in the long-term, the remedial design/remedial action for the Amended Remedy (Thermal Treatment) from ROD Amendment dated November 16, 2020, should be implemented. Afterwards, the groundwater extraction and treatment system at OU03 should be operated until remedial action objectives for groundwater are achieved. OU04 Protectiveness Statement: The remedy at OU04 currently protects human health and the environment because groundwater extraction and treatment, groundwater monitoring and institutional controls prevent exposure to contaminated groundwater. However, for the remedy to be protective in the long-term, an institutional control should be implemented to prevent use of groundwater for the area-wide contaminated plume, and the Remedial Action for the Amended Remedy (In Situ Thermal Remediation) from ROD Amendment dated September 30, 2019, should be implemented. Afterwards, the groundwater extraction and treatment system at OU04 should be operated until remedial action objectives for groundwater are achieved. Sitewide Protectiveness Statement: The remedy at the site currently protects human health and the environment because remedial actions prevent exposure to contaminated soil and groundwater. However, for the remedy to be protective in the long-term, additional remedial actions will need to be implemented to address the remaining contaminated soil sources at OU01 and OU02 and to expedite groundwater restoration at OU03 and OU04. Current Status (OU01 and OU03) Following the OU01 ROD Amendment, the EPA and Wainwright Industries entered into negotiations to perform the remedial design/remedial action of the Amended Remedy. The negotiations ended on August 8, 2022, with no agreement. Subsequently, the EPA took over the implementation of the Amended Remedy at OU01. The EPA completed remedial design for OU01 on August 1, 2024. The EPA began the remedial action for the Amended Remedy at OU01 on August 30, 2024, which is ongoing. The groundwater remedy at OU03 was not changed. The existing groundwater extraction and treatment system will continue to treat the contaminated groundwater plume, and mitigation systems will continue operating to address the vapor intrusion pathway. Current Status (OU02 and OU04) Following the OU02 ROD Amendment, the EPA began the remedial design to implement the Amended Remedy in December 2019. The remedial design at OU02 was completed on September 30, 2020. The EPA performed additional site characterization to supplement the remedial design in the May 2022. The EPA began the remedial action for the Amended Remedy at OU02 on September 28, 2022, which is ongoing. The groundwater extraction and treatment system at OU04 has operated, as designed, to generally reduce contamination in groundwater. The remedial action at OU04 is ongoing. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Institutional Controls (OU01) An environmental covenant on the former Wainwright property was filed at the County Recorder’s office in St. Louis County in October 2016. Institutional Controls (OU02)
An environmental covenant on the Valley Technologies property was filed at the County Recorder’s office in St. Louis County in May 2017.

Sampling and Monitoring
Operation and Maintenance (OU03) As the responsible party, Wainwright Industries is conducting the Operation & Maintenance for the OU03 under MoDNR oversight. The O&M plan was approved in May 2003. The primary activities associated with O&M include normal operation and monitoring of the remedial systems; equipment monitoring and inspection; record keeping and reporting; and sampling and chemical analysis of soil vapor extraction influent, groundwater extraction and treatment system influent and effluent and groundwater monitoring wells. These activities are summarized and reported back to the EPA and MoDNR in quarterly reports. The groundwater sampling is conducted annually. Operation and Maintenance (OU04)
The O&M of groundwater remedial systems at OU04 was transferred from EPA fund-lead to MoDNR state-lead on October 1, 2019. MoDNR is conducting long-term O&M activities including operation of the groundwater extraction and treatment system and groundwater sampling of the monitoring well network.
