### Background

The 57-acre Caldwell Lace Leather Company [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in Auburn, Kentucky. The site includes the area where Caldwell Lace Leather Company (Caldwell) disposed of wastes from its tannery facility from 1972 to 1985.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1990 because of contaminated groundwater and soil resulting from waste handling practices.

EPA, the [Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection (KDEP)](http://dep.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx) and the site’s [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. By monitoring groundwater and surface water, maintaining the landfill cover, and working to place institutional controls on the site property, EPA, KDEP and the site’s PRPs continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

Following site investigations, EPA determined that site contamination does not pose a threat to people and the environment.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA led site investigation activities in cooperation with KDEP.

**1984**  
KDEP ordered the site’s owner to maintain vegetation on the landfill area of the site in accordance with the closure plan, which also included applying fertilizer to the area, regrading and revegetating the area, and monitoring groundwater and surface water.

**1985**  
The site’s owner covered the site with soil and placed a fence around the site to restrict access.

**1989**  
The site’s owner completed the closure plan for the landfill area of the site.

**1992**  
The United States Geological Survey conducted dye trace studies at the site. The studies included dividing the site into a grid and taking composite soil samples.

**1994**  
The site’s long-term remedy, selected in 1994, included EPA’s decision that no action was necessary to protect people and the environment. EPA recommended that KDEP or the current landfill owner continue groundwater and surface water monitoring, place land use restrictions on the landfill property, and maintain the landfill cover. Following placement of institutional controls on the site property, the EPA plans to delete the site from the NPL.

**2018**  
In 2018, KDEP began placing institutional controls (signage and information notices) on site property.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy, selected in 1994, included EPA’s decision that no action was necessary to protect people and the environment. EPA also recommended that KDEP or the current landfill owner continue groundwater and surface water monitoring, place land use restrictions on the landfill property, and maintain the landfill cover. Following placement of institutional controls on the site property, the EPA plans to delete the site from the NPL.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

In 2018, KDEP began placing institutional controls (signage and information notices) on site property.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

In 1984, KDEP and the site’s owner entered into legal agreements to conduct closure activities for the landfill area of the site. In 1988, EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRPs to investigate the site. EPA used federal funds for site investigation activities.
