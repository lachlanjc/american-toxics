Background
The 200-acre Middletown Air Field is located in Middletown in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. From 1868 to 1966, the federal government owned and operated the Middletown Air Field as the Olmstead Air Force Base. Historical operations at the site included the maintenance, overhauling and testing of aircraft. In 1971, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) began operation of the majority of the site as the Harrisburg International Airport (HIA). In 1983, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were detected in groundwater wells operated by HIA at the site. Investigations indicated that facility operations at the Air Force Base and HIA resulted in contamination of soil, surface water and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. The site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in 1986. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. EPA deleted the site from the NPL in July 1997, having met the established cleanup goals. Since 1998, the Susquehanna Area Regional Airport Administration has owned and operated the HIA facility.﻿ Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In 1983, trichloroethylene (TCE) and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were discovered in six of the ten groundwater supply wells operated at the Harrisburg International Airport (HIA) facility, then owned by Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). In 1984, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) removed sludge and liquids in awaste collection building on the site, began closure of the fire training pits, and removed all contaminated materials from the location. The same year, the United States Air Force removed some waste drums from the Mead Heights area. In 1987, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) documenting the selection of an interim remedy for the HIA water supply system consisting of the construction of a central treatment plant in conjunction with continued groundwater monitoring. These cleanup activities were implemented by the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) and were considered an interim response pending supplemental investigation of the remainder of the site. Construction of the groundwater treatment system was completed in 1987 and is currently operational. Five disposal areas were identified as potential sources of groundwater contamination at the site and were investigated during the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) from 1988 through 1990. In December 1990, EPA issued a second ROD documenting the selection of the permanent remedy consisting of continued operation of the groundwater treatment system, land-use restrictions, and groundwater monitoring. In April 1992, EPA issued an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) in response to Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's concerns regarding the relationship between soil and groundwater contamination at the site. The ESD redesignated the 1990 ROD as an interim ROD and required additional investigations and studies to characterize soil and groundwater. The ESD also modified the existing institutional controls. Following the completion of an additional investigation and feasability study, EPA issued a final ROD in September 1996. The ROD documented the determination that no further action was necessary at the site and the currently implemented remedies and institutional controls were sufficient to protect human health and the environment. In October 2023, EPA issued a second Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) that modifies the Selected Remedy by changing the treatment system from the existing air stripper water treatment system to a Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) water treatment system. This upgrade is to treat the groundwater for non-site related contaminants to standards set forth by the PADEP Safe Drinking Water Program (SDWP). The system upgrade, financed by the current owner and operator, will still be protective of and effectively treat site-related contamination. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
﻿The long-term remedy included extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater; institutional controls to restrict groundwater use and manage soil in certain areas of the site; and continued monitoring of groundwater, surface water and sediment. In 1997, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) to implement the remedy selected in the 1996 ROD and to continue operation of the Harrisburg International Airport (﻿HIA) groundwater treatment system. Currently, institutional controls in place at the site include the continued operation of the water treatment system; annual groundwater, surface water, and sediment sampling; and PADEP oversight of any potential soil disturbance. Groundwater extraction and treatment is also ongoing. The site is partially occupied by the HIA, which is operated by the Susquehanna Area Regional Airport Authority (SARAA). As a component of the site remedy, SARAA operates a series of onsite production wells to both control the onsite groundwater contaminant plume and supply water to HIA. Extracted water is treated via airstripping prior to distribution. In 2014, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was identified in groundwater above a health-based screening level concentration of 400 parts per trillion. EPA determined that PFOS contamination is likely associated with HIA operations. PFOS contamination is being addressed via the PADEP drinking water program and SARAA, who are working together to implement improvements to the grounwater treatment system. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent, 2022 Five-Year Review (PDF), concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2027. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Institutional controls are in place to restrict groundwater use and require soil sampling/analysis during excavations. Additional information about the institutional controls are available in the 2022 Five-Year Review (PDF) (pages 7-9).

Emergency Response and Removal
The cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1984, the state and the U.S. Air Force removed sludge and liquids in a waste collection building, removed all contaminated materials from the fire training pits, and removed some waste drums from the Mead Heights area.
