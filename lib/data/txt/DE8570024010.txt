Background
Dover Air Force Base (DAFB) is located in Kent County, Delaware, 3.5 miles southeast of the city of Dover. DAFB encompasses approximately 4,000 acres of land, including annexes, easements, and leased property. The Base began operations in December 1941. The present host organization is the 436th Airlift Wing, a part of the USAF Air Mobility Command. Past activity resulted in contamination of soil and groundwater. Environmental investigations of DAFB began in 1983. The Site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in March 1989.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
 This site is being addressed through federal actions. An August 1989 Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) between EPA, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC), and the Air Force identified areas for investigation and possible cleanup. The FFA provided the framework and a schedule to accomplish this work. Currently, there are 24 operable units being addressed under the Superfund program. EPA has signed Records of Decision (RODs) selecting remedies for 24 operable units. Remedies at DAFB address either contaminated soil or groundwater. Remedies for contaminated soil typically include removing the contaminated soil or installing a cap over the site. Additionally, Land Use Controls (LUCs) are implemented to prevent people from drinking contaminated water or from building residences, daycares and schools in contaminated areas. Remediation is either on-going or complete for each OU except for OU 25 for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (﻿PFAS). A full list of operable units can be viewed under the Operable Units section.

What Is the Current Site Status?
 The Air Force has the lead role for cleaning up the Dover AFB. There is currently one OU under investigation which may require a remedy at the site. Per the Federal Facilities Agreement between EPA, DNREC and the Air Force, a Site Management Plan (SMP) is annually updated with activities at each operable unit and area of concern. Remedies at DAFB address either contaminated soil or groundwater. Remedies for contaminated soil typically include removing the contaminated soil or installing a cap over the site. Additionally, Land Use Controls (LUCs) are implemented to prevent people from drinking contaminated water or from building residences, daycares and schools in contaminated areas. Remedies for contaminated groundwater at DAFB typically fall into two categories: 
Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) which relies on natural processes to clean up or attenuate contamination in soil and groundwater. Natural attenuation occurs at most contaminated sites; however, the right conditions must exist underground to clean sites properly. If not, cleanup will not be quick enough or complete enough. Conditions are monitored to make sure natural attenuation is working.
Accelerated Anaerobic Biodegradation (AAB) which uses naturally occurring microbes that consume contamination in soil and groundwater. For bioremediation to be effective, the right tempera­ture, nutrients, and food also must be present so that the microbes can grow and multiply—and consume more contaminants. Food sources such as emulsified vegetable oil are injected into the groundwater to stimulate microbial growth. 
A full list of activities per each operable unit can be found under the Cleanup Progress section. The lead agency conducts five-year reviews for remedies implemented. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent, an independent determination,  can be found here, 2018 Five-Year Review (PDF). The next five-year review was scheduled for 2023. The U.S. Air Force did not submit a draft of their Sixth Five-Year Review for Dover Air Force Base within the minimum regulatory review timeframe of six months prior to the statutory due date of October 15, 2023. Subsequently, EPA issued an independent determination of deferred protectiveness in a letter to Air Force dated September 26, 2023. EPA received the initial draft of the Sixth Five-Year Review for Dover Air Force Base on December 21, 2023, and the draft report is under review. The final Sixth Five-Year Review Report Addendum is proposed for receipt and concurrence by EPA on October 31, 2024.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Land Use Controls (LUCs) are implemented at Dover AFB to prevent people from drinking contaminated water or from building residences, daycares and schools in contaminated areas. Top of Page
