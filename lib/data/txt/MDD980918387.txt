### Background

The 68 <sup>th</sup> Street Site encompasses several landfills spread over a 239-acre area in Rosedale, Baltimore County, Maryland. From the 1950s through the 1970s, these landfills accepted industrial and commercial wastes containing hazardous wastes, which contaminated soil, sediment, groundwater, surface water and wetland areas.

EPA proposed the Site for the National Priorities List (“NPL”) in January 1999 and re-proposed the Site in April 2003. EPA ultimately decided to assess the Site under the Superfund Alternative Site (“SAS”) process. Under the SAS process, sites need not be finalized on the NPL. However, the SAS process uses the same process and standards for investigation and cleanup as used for sites on the NPL.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In September 1953, Mr. Robb Tyler was issued a permit by the Maryland State Health Department allowing him to operate a sanitary landfill on the site property. Operations included the landfilling of industrial and commercial refuse.

EPA and Maryland have been involved in cleanup activities at the site for several years. In the 1980s, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) conducted several emergency cleanup actions that included removing more than 50 of the 55-gallon drums of assorted waste. In the Spring of 2000, EPA conducted an Expanded Site Inspection, with follow-up sampling in February 2001. In 2008, under an EPA consent order, several parties removed contaminated surface soils, containers, gas cylinders, empty drums and batteries from the site.

A Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) was completed in March 2013. The RI/FS evaluated the extent of contamination and developed alternatives to clean up the Site.

On September 30, 2013, EPA selected the final cleanup plan in a Record of Decision (ROD). The cleanup plan includes, among other requirements:

- Installing a soil cap over contaminated soil and landfill areas;
- Excavating and removing contaminated soil hotspots and pond sediment;
- Removing and recycling surface debris;
- Collecting and treating leachate and contaminated ground water from the landfills through enhanced wetlands, a biowall, and treatment at a local wastewater treatment facility; and
- Restoring stream banks and revegetating the capped landfills with trees, shrubs and other native vegetation.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In November 2017, a consent decree was completed between EPA and more than 40 responsible parties to perform the cleanup at the 68th Street Dump/Industrial Enterprises Site. Under terms of the consent decree, the parties will finance and perform a $51.5 million EPA-approved cleanup, perform additional natural resources restoration work, and pay the state and federal natural resource trustees $490,000 for past and future costs related to natural resource damages. Defendants are also required to pay $630,000 for an off-site restoration project.

The 12 parties that are responsible for performing the cleanup include: AAI Corporation; Acme Markets Inc.; AK Steel Corporation; Browning-Ferris, Inc.; Black & Decker (U.S.) Inc.; Brunswick Corporation; ConAgra Grocery Products Company, LLC; Crown Cork & Seal Company, Inc.; CSX Realty Development, LLC; CSX Transportation, Inc.; Exxon Mobil Corporation and Illinois Tool Works Inc.

Along with these 12 parties, the other remaining parties contributed about $18.8 million towards the settlement.

EPA approved the pre-final design of the landfill cover system for the 239-acre area site. Work is anticipated to begin in May 2023. The parties' performing the work will be on-site for approximately three years while the remedial design is implemented.

Below is a list of what the community can expect and may notice beginning May 2023:

- Contractors and vehicle activity
- Site equipment and trailer setup
- Installation of fences, entrances, and temporary access roads
- Clearing of vegetation in order to effectively clean up the contamination. *Please note, the Site will be re-vegetated with native species at the completion of the cleanup*
