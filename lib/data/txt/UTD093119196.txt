Background
The 7-acre Petrochem Recycling Corp./Ekotek site is located in northern Salt Lake City, Utah. Site activities have included operation of an oil refinery, hazardous waste storage and treatment, and used oil recycling. Improper and illegal waste management practices led to a number of releases and potential releases of hazardous substances at the site. These activities contaminated groundwater and soil with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2003. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing.
