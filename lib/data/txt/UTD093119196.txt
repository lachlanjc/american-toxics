### Background

The 7-acre Petrochem Recycling Corp./Ekotek site is located in northern Salt Lake City, Utah. Site activities have included operation of an oil refinery, hazardous waste storage and treatment, and used oil recycling. Improper and illegal waste management practices led to a number of releases and potential releases of hazardous substances at the site. These activities contaminated groundwater and soil with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2003. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included excavation of the plume of oily liquid wastes floating on top of the groundwater, bioremediation and natural attenuation of contaminated groundwater, and excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil. Remedy construction took place between 1999 and 2000. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing.

Site cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions included stabilizing on-site wastes; keeping track of potentially hazardous materials found on site; and the removal of surface and underground storage tanks, containers, contaminated sludge, pooled liquids and processing equipment.
