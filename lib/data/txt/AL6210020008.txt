### Background

The 5,170-acre Alabama Army Ammunition Plant (AAAP) site is located in Talladega County, Alabama, near Childersburg. It is the location of a former explosives manufacturing facility. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1987 because past operations contaminated soil, sediments and ground water. The Army, EPA and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. By cleaning up and monitoring soils and ground water, enforcing institutional controls, and conducting required Five-Year Reviews, the Army, EPA and ADEM continue to make sure residents and the environment are protected from site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is located in Talladega County, Alabama, just east of the Coosa River and 40 miles southeast of Birmingham. The nearest city is Childersburg, which owns the site and currently attempting to redevelop the site.

- From 1941 to 1945, a company manufactured explosives at the plant under contract with the federal government. In August 1945, the federal government placed the plant on standby status. In 1973, the Army declared the plant to be excess property and transferred it to the General Services Administration (GSA) so that GSA could sell the property. However, GSA rejected about 1,620 acres of the former manufacturing area because of contamination concerns. In 1977, a company purchased a 1,354-acre parcel within the GSA portion of the site for use as a paper mill.
- In 1987, EPA placed the site on the NPL. In 1991, after the Army, EPA and ADEM determined that ground water in Area A was not contaminated and stockpiled contaminated soils from Area A in Area B, the U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD, sold the clean (Area A) property to private property owners. At the time, the Area B remained under federal government control. Area A is currently used for occasional logging and as a wildlife preserve.
- The Army, EPA and ADEM have been working together since the 1990s to clean up Area A and Area B soils. In 2003, DoD transferred Area B to the City of Childersburg to use for several purposes, including industrial, commercial and recreational land uses and wildlife habitat. The locality plans to develop Area B into an industrial park while investigation of contaminated ground water on the property is ongoing.

The Army leads the investigation and cleanup of the site, with oversight provided by EPA and ADEM.

- Site investigations and cleanup activities have focused on seven areas, which EPA refers to as operable units, or OUs. They include OU-1, Area B (Stockpiled Soils from Area A); OU-2, Area B (Study Areas 6, 7, 10 and 21); OU-3, Area A (Study Areas 12 and D); OU-4, Area B (Ground Water); OU-5, Area A (Area A Soils and Ground Water); OU-6, Area B (Study Areas 2, 10, 16, 17, 19 and 22); and OU-7, Area B (Remaining Soils, Sediments, and Surface Water).
- Between 1991 and 1997, the Army and EPA issued six cleanup plans (Records of Decision, or RODs) for the site, including a final cleanup plan for Area A. The plans describe the Army’s approach for cleaning up ground water and soil for different parts of the site.
- In August 2010, the Army submitted a plan to complete the cleanup of soils in Area B. The issues being discussed to complete these actions are under discussion. The EPA, Arm and ADEM are currently in informal dispute regarding approaches for cleanup of ground water contamination in Area B. After selecting the best approach, the Army and EPA will issue a cleanup plan. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing to inform the groundwater cleanup decision.

**Cleanup Progress**

- Between 1994 and 1997, the Army cleaned up about 120,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil. The Army completed cleanup actions at Area A in 1998 and is continuing with cleanup actions in Area B. In 1994, the Army completed thermal treatment of stockpiled soils from Area A. In 1995, the Army finished digging up and thermally treating explosives-contaminated soil from Study Area 12. In 1998, the Army completed all soil and ground water cleanup activities for Area A.
- The Army has completed several cleanup actions on parts of Area B. In 1996, the Army completed the process of digging up and thermally treating soils from the old industrial areas in Study Areas 6, 7, 10 and 21. In 1997, the Army completed its cleanup of contaminated soils in Study Areas 2, 10, 16, 17, 19 and 22.
- In 2000 and 2001, the Army installed 20 new ground water monitoring wells. The Army is currently evaluating whether the ground water contamination will naturally attenuate in a reasonable time frame or whether a more active cleanup approach is required.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA and the Army, in consultation with ADEM, have conducted several [Five-Year Reviews](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/search-superfund-five-year-reviews) of the site’s remedies. The site’s fifth Five-Year Review, was completed in 2023. While there have been several informal disputes over asbestos, groundwater and other issues, all of these disputes were resolved in 2022 and 2023 and the Army is in the process of evaluating and addressing ground water and asbestos at the site. The Army has recently completed an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) which was approved by EPA in April 2024. A Groundwater Remedial Action Addendum/Feasibility Study is underway. Asbestos abatement is also underway at portions of the site.
