Background
The Site is approximately 45 acres and located in the Village of Kimberton, East Pikeland Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania . Surrounding the Site is undeveloped land to the west and north. To the east and northeast, across Coldstream Road are several businesses as well as a few residences. A residential community and a senior living retirement community are located to the south of Pike Springs Road. To the north of the Site is an unnamed tributary that flows along Hares Hill Road through the Village of Kimberton. This unnamed tributary eventually flows to French Creek and then to the Schuylkill River. Local groundwater flows in a north-northeasterly direction from the Site towards the Village of Kimberton and is known to discharge into local streams at topographic low points. The Henry Company, the Potenitally Responsible Party, and its predecessors have used approximately 25 acres of the Site to manufacture asphalt products since 1969. In 2007, approximately 21.5 acres of the Site, consisting primarily of undeveloped land, was sold by the PRPs to Kimberton Town Square LP and currently remains undeveloped.  Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Operable Unit (OU)-1 Drinking Water Supply Remedy Implementation:  In 1986, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, now known as the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP), negotiated a Consent Order with the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) to provide 23 residential wells with granular activated carbon filters and supply two commercial locations with potable water tanks until a permanent public waterline was installed. In the OU-1 ROD, EPA selected "no further action" and recommended the continued implementation of the activities outlined in the CO. In June 1991, residential properties in the area were connected to the public water supply and in April 1992, the granular activated carbon filters that treated residential well water were dismantled.  Operable Unit (OU) -2 Groundwater Extraction and Treatment Remedy Implementation:  Under a Consent Decree with EPA, the PRPs prepared the technical specifications and design for the remediation system for OU-2, which was submitted on July 5, 1990. EPA approved the final groundwater treatment system design on February 26, 1993. The groundwater recovery system includes ten extraction wells (PW-001 to PW-010) and Spring SP-001 sump. The groundwater treatment system consists of a 5,500-gallon equalization tank, an air stripping tower, and pumps and controls. Each extraction well has a submersible pump, well vault, and sensors/controls that are linked by fiber optics and electrical wiring to a process control panel in the treatment building to allow for automatic operation. Groundwater is pumped into the building and treated by an air stripper to remove the Volatile Organic Compounds. The treatment system has the capacity to pump and treat up to 250 gallons per minute. The effluent discharges 85 million gallons of treated water per year to an unnamed tributary, referred to as Stream A, which is north of the Site. Vapor Intrusion (VI) was identified as a potential new migration pathway during the 2009 FYR, and a VI evaluation was performed in 2011. Based on data collected from the indoor air and subslab sampling, vapor mitigation systems were installed at an on-site warehouse and an off-site residence. Subsequent sampling in 2013 and 2014 indicated that the mitigation systems were performing as intended. More about vapor intrusion.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The remedy for OU-1 is protective of human health and the environment. The public water supply line was installed for residences and businesses around the Site in 1992 and provides a permanent and protective source of water. The remedy for OU-2 is protective of human health and the environment. A groundwater treatment system was installed on the Site and has been operating since December I993. The groundwater plume is contained on-site by a series of extraction wells and treatment will continue until groundwater cleanup levels are achieved. Institutional controls are in place to prevent groundwater exposure, prevent disturbance of the caps at the former lagoons and septic pit, and prevent current and future VI risks. To learn more about the instutional controls at the site, please see the 2019 Five-Year Review (Page 9). The Site was designated Sitewide Ready for Anticipated Use (SWRAU) in 2018.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Emergency Response and Removal
Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions in 1986 included drum removal, excavation of lagoons and treatment of residential wells. The site’s Potentially Responsible Party provided an alternate source of drinking water to 25 nearby residences and businesses until completion of the public water system connection in 1992.
