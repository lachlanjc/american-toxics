### Background

The 173-acre Riverbank Army Ammunition Plant is located near Modesto, California. Manufacturing operations at the site contaminated groundwater, soils and sediments with heavy metals. Cleanup, operation and maintenance activities, and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.

The Riverbank Army Ammunition Plant is participating in the Installation Restoration Program, a specially funded program established by the Department of Defense (DoD) in 1978 to identify, investigate and clean up petroleum and hazardous contaminants at DoD facilities. In April 1990, the Army, EPA and the State of California signed a Federal Facility Agreement, which established a procedural framework and schedule for the Army to carry out the necessary site cleanup actions.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the siteâ€™s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires evaluation of the need for institutional controls, a vapor intrusion study, and ongoing operation and maintenance activities, including groundwater monitoring.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The selected long-term remedy included groundwater extraction and treatment; stabilization, capping and monitoring of the landfill; and no further cleanup action for the ponds. Construction of the landfill cap finished in 1995. Design and construction of the groundwater treatment system finished in 1996; it is currently in operation and maintenance mode. Groundwater monitoring of the ponds is ongoing. EPA has updated the remedy to include in-place treatment of the groundwater plume and institutional controls restrict certain uses of the site.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

The Army supplied affected residents with bottled water beginning in 1989. The Army also closed contaminated wells, replacing them with clean wells. An interim groundwater treatment system began operating in 1991 to treat chromium and cyanide contaminants. The Army finished connecting affected residents to the public water supply in 1992. In 1993, the Army conducted a removal action, or short-term cleanup, to remove and dispose of petroleum- and zinc-contaminated sediments from its industrial waste treatment ponds.
