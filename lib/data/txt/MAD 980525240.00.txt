### Background

The 235-acre Salem Acres Site is located in Salem, Massachusetts. From 1946 through 1969, four acres of the Site received sludge, grit, and grease from the South Essex Sewerage District through an agreement with the property owners. The sludge, which included tannery waste, was placed in eight unlined, uncovered disposal pits. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), arsenic, and chromium were found to be present in the pits. In addition, there was a fly ash disposal area next to the sludge lagoons and an old landfill area adjacent to the fly ash pile, yielding a total of 13 acres of contamination. After immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, the Site’s long-term remedy was put in place. EPA deleted the Site from the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2001.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Site was addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. All areas exceeding EPA's clean-up goals have been excavated and the materials disposed off-Site at permitted landfills. At the conclusion of EPA's response actions, the Site was restored to its natural vegetation and allowed for unrestricted land use.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has assessed the conditions at the Site and determined that initial capping and liquid waste removal actions, combined with site security measures and three remedial actions, have eliminated the potential for exposure to contamination. The landfill area, debris piles, fly ash pile, sludge lagoons, and associated contaminated soils have been excavated and the contaminated materials disposed off-Site at permitted landfills. Final site restoration of these areas was completed in the spring of 1998. In the summer of 1999, fly ash was removed from the wetland next to the former fly ash pile; the wetland was restored at that time. Follwoing EPA's response actions, the Site allowed for unrestricted land use.

Following the conclusion of clean-up activities, EPA deleted the site from the National Priorities List (NPL) in 2001.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

**Institutional Controls are not required for this site.**

This Site does not require institutional controls (ICs) because no contamination remains at the Site that could result in an unacceptable exposure. For additional information on this site, the site contacts should be consulted.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
