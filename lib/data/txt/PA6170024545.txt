### Background

The Naval Air Development Center site in Warminster Township and Ivyland Borough, Bucks County, PA, covers 840 acres and was renamed Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) in 1993. Commissioned in 1944, NAWC's main function was the research, development and testing of Naval aircraft systems. Wastes were generated during aircraft maintenance and repair, pest control, firefighting training, machine and plating shop operations, spray painting, and various materials research and testing activities in laboratories. These wastes include paints, solvents, sludges from industrial wastewater treatment, and waste oils. NAWC was placed on the Superfund program's National Priorities List in October 1989 due to the threat posed by eight disposal areas to groundwater quality. Pursuant to the Base Realignment and Closure Act (BRAC), NAWC ceased operations in September 1996. Most of the property has been transferred to the private sector.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

A 1990 Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) between EPA, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) and the Navy identified 10 areas or operable units (OU) for investigation and possible cleanup. The FFA provided the framework and a schedule to accomplish this work. The following sites are being addressed under the Superfund program: Area A (Sites 1, 2, and 3 and the Impoundment Area), Area B (Sites 5, 6, and 7), and Area C (Sites 4 and 8). A fourth general area, Area D, is located west of Jacksonville Road and primarily includes the main building complex at the former Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC). A site-wide OU has recently been added to investigate PFAS contamination.

EPA signed Records of Decision (ROD) documents selecting remedies for the 13 OUs. All remedies for contaminated soil are in place, and the remedies for contaminated groundwater are operating properly and successfully. More information can be found by visiting the *Operable Units* page.

  
**OU1, OU5, OU12 and OU14 – Groundwater at Areas A and D**  
The construction of groundwater extraction wells in Areas A and D at NAWC was initiated in late 1998 and early 1999, respectively. Pumping and treatment of contaminated groundwater in Area A was initiated in Summer 1999. The primary contaminants at Area A are TCE, PCE and carbon tetrachloride; at Area D, the contaminant is TCE. Final RODs for Area A and Area D groundwater were both completed in 2000.

**OU2 – Time Critical Removal Action**

In response to trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) contamination detected in off-base private wells, in 1993, the Navy installed water treatment systems in over 40 homes and subsequently connected over 20 homes to public water systems. Since sampling results suggested that the contamination was due to both NAWC and an unknown off-base source, EPA connected an additional 40 residences to a public water system in 1994. In 1995, the Navy connected an additional a commercial facility to public water.

**OU4 – Groundwater at Area C**  
In 1996, the construction of an on-base groundwater treatment system was completed and the pumping and treatment of PCE-contaminated groundwater at Area C was initiated.

**OU6 – Soils, sediment and surface water associated with Site 4 at Area C**  
A removal action at Site 4 was conducted to excavate and remove waste from a series eight disposal trenches in 1996. The primary contaminant in the waste was PCBs. A No Further Action ROD was issues in 2000.

**OU7 - Soils and wastes associated with Site 6 & 7 at Area B**  
In 1997, a removal action was conducted at Sites 6 and 7, a series of disposal trenches and pits. Contaminants in soil and waste excavated and removed from Sites 6 and 7 included TCE, PCE, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The remedy issued in the ROD (2000) comprised of a soil cover, monitoring and land use controls.

**OU8 – Soils, Surface water and sediment associated with Site 1 & 2 at Area A**  
In 1998, soil contaminated with cadmium, lead and other heavy metals was excavated and removed as part of a removal action at Sites 1 and 2. The remedy documented in the 2000 ROD comprised of drainage and erosion controls, institutional controls and monitoring.

**OU9 – Soils, sediment, and surface water associated with Site 8 at Area C**

In 1999, soil contaminated with lead was removed from Site 8 and a No Further Action ROD was issued.

**OU10 – Soils associated with Area D**

In 2000, a No action ROD was issued.

**OU11 – Soils, surface water and sediment associated with Site 5 at Area B**

In 2000, a ROD was issued for monitoring and no action.

**OU13 – Groundwater at Area B**

In 2000, a Final ROD was issued for the groundwater at Area B, which determined that No Further Action was required. Monitoring previously performed as part of the 1993 interim ROD (OU1) was discontinued.

A full list of OUs can be viewed under the *Operable Units* section.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The Navy is currently investigating [per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)](http://www.epa.gov/pfas) contamination found at the NAWC site. The Navy, with input from EPA and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, is conducting a remedial investigation to define the nature and extent of the contamination and identify possibly sources. The Navy has added additional granular activated carbon units to their groundwater pump and treatment system as an interim action to treat PFAS contamination in groundwater in Areas A, D and C.

**Five Year Review**

The Navy conducts five-year reviews for remedies implemented. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent can be found here, [2021 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2321348). The next five-year review is schedule for 2026
