### Background

The 3.7-acre Reilly Tar and Chemical Corp. (Dover Plant) site is located in Dover, Ohio. A coal tar refinery operated on site from 1932 to 1956. During that time, coal tar wastes accumulated on the ground from spillage and other site activities, leading to soil and groundwater contamination. The cleanup construction at the site was completed in 2000.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Cleanup at the site consisted of disposing of solidified tarry materials off-site, excavating and disposing of sediment and contaminated soil on-site, capping portions of the site, controlling and collecting groundwater, reducing groundwater contamination through natural processes, long-term groundwater monitoring, and limiting the use of and access to the site. The remedy construction was completed in 2000. Ongoing activities at the site include the operation of a hydraulic control and tar removal system, and long-term groundwater monitoring.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In early 2017, the performing Potentially Responsible Party for the site discontinued operation of the remedy because of a bankruptcy action. EPA took over the operations of the remedy a few months later and is currently operating the remedy. The site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the siteâ€™s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent five-year review completed on May 2020 concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term.

Since the completion of the most recent [five-year review(PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/955872.pdf) (57 pp, 6MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ), analysis of groundwater data has demonstrated that although one of the remedial action objectives for the site, hydraulic control of the perched aquifer, is being achieved by the remedy, extraction of groundwater and removal of tar may be improved. EPA is improving the groundwater capture system and the site monitoring plan. This will include a revised long-term monitoring plan with installation and monitoring of additional groundwater wells to determine if the remedy is protective of human health and the environment in the long term. EPA also notes that tar removal remains adequate since 2015 and additional sampling and monitoring will be implemented to determine the overall effect on the perched aquifer and groundwater plume.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup at the site has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1989, an expedited response action removed 1,442 tons of coal tar and asphalt material.
