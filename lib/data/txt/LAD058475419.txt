### Background

**Current Status**

On September 22, 2014, EPA listed Delta Shipyard on the National Priority List (NPL). The first step after listing the site on the (NPL) is to conduct community interviews and develop a Community Involvement Plan.

While the community involvement is being conducted, EPA will be working to identify and reach an agreement to investigate and cleanup the Site with the potentially responsible party(s) (PRP) for the Site. Either the EPA or the PRP will perform and finance the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for the Site. The purpose of the RI/FS is to determine the nature and extent of contamination and to gather sufficient information about the Site to support an informed risk management decision regarding which remedy is the most appropriate for the Site.EPA negotiated with Sequoia Corporation (Chromalloy American LLC) and Dean Services West L.L.C. to conduct a remedial investigation (RI) of the site. and issued a Unilateral Order of Consent te in June 2018. EPA held a public meeting on the status of the site in Houma in October 2018 ro update the public of progress at the site. Chromalloy has collected data at the site and is preparing a draft data report for EPA review and comment.

**Site Background**

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Oily waste from the cleaning process was stored in several unlined earthen pits used as evaporation ponds. Large volumes of waste remain on site, and hazardous substances have been found in ground water, surface water and soil. Wetlands surrounding the Site are contaminated with metals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Without remediation of the site, additional releases to ground water, surface water and soil will continue to occur.Oily waste from the cleaning process was stored in several unlined earthen pits used as evaporation ponds.
