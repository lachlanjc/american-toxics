### Background

The 50-acre Packaging Corporation of America site is located in Manistee County, Michigan. A pulping mill produced materials for corrugated boxes on site. Site features include a waste disposal area with eight lagoons. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Affected groundwater discharges to nearby Manistee Lake. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included lagoon caps and monitoring of the groundwater and Manistee Lake. Calculations of current and potential risks indicate that the contamination does not pose an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. If future monitoring results indicate that the site is causing unacceptable environmental risks, then further cleanup will be required. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
