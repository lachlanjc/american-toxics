### Background

The 150-acre Freeway Sanitary Landfill site is located in Burnsville, Minnesota, just southwest of Interstate 35W and the Minnesota River. The landfill contains a wide variety of wastes, including battery casings and aluminum furnace slag. Leachate from the landfill has contaminated groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Landfill gases are also a threat at the site; currently, no landfill gas venting system exists.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is listed on the National Priorities List, and is being investigated and cleaned up under the Minnesota Closed Landfill Program. Read more information about the site at [Freeway Landfill and Dump site](https://www.pca.state.mn.us/waste/freeway-landfill-and-dump).
