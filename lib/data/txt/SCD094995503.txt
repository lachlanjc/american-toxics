### Background

The 50-acre Kalama Specialty Chemicals [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located on Highway 21, approximately four miles from Beaufort in Beaufort County, South Carolina. The site includes drainage ditches and concrete building slabs associated with the Kalama Specialty Chemicals, Inc. facility and a former mobile home park. Highway 21 and the Marine Corps Air Force Base Station Beaufort border the site to the east. The Seaboard Coast Line Railroad borders the site to the west. A drive-in movie theater and a residential area border the site to the north. A forested area and a cement plant borders the site to the south. Commercial and industrial businesses and agricultural land are also located near the site.

From 1973 to 1977, Vega Chemical produced a wide range of chemicals at the site. From 1977 until 1979, Kalama Specialty Chemicals, Inc. manufactured herbicides and plant-growth regulators at the site. Facility operations ended in 1979 after a reactor exploded, setting the facility on fire and spilling various organic chemicals. Following the explosion and fire, the company acquired the 34-acre area next to the original 16-acre facility property. The adjacent property included a former mobile home park, two treatment lagoons and several structures.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1984 because of contaminated groundwater, sediment and soil resulting from facility operations. EPA, the [South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC)](https://www.scdhec.gov/), and Goodrich, the site’s [potentially responsible party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site. By treating and sampling groundwater and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, SCDHEC and the site’s PRP continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

The remedy at the Site currently protects human health and the environment.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Goodrich, the site’s PRP, leads site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and SCDHEC.

**1993**  
EPA issued the site’s long-term cleanup plan. It included

- digging up and treating contaminated soil and sediment
- disposing of soil and sediment that does not meet cleanup standards off site
- placing treated soil and sediment in the dug-up areas
- using a pump-and-treat system to extract and treat groundwater
- installing additional groundwater monitoring wells
- monitoring groundwater.

**1995**  
EPA dug up 604 cubic yards of contaminated soil and 80 cubic yards of contaminated sediment and removed them from the site.

**1997**  
The PRP completed construction of the final pump-and-treat system in 1997 and began operating the system in 1998.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11112038.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2018. The remedy at the Site currently protects human health and the environment. All soils exceeding residential cleanup standards have been removed from the Site and contaminated groundwater is not being used for potable purposes.

The site’s PRP will conduct additional studies to determine any connection between contamination at the cement plant south of the site and the site’s contamination. The pump-and-treat system continues to operate at the site. The PRP conducts ground water sampling twice annually.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The PRP conducts ground water sampling twice annually to assess cleanup progress.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA and SCDHEC negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRP to investigate and clean up the site. The PRP continues to fund site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
