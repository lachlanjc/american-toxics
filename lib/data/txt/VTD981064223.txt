### Background

The Bennington Landfill Superfund Site (Site), located off Houghton Lane in Bennington, VT is a 15-acre municipal sanitary landfill. The Site was placed on EPA's National Priority List (NPL) on March 31,1989. The areas to the north and east of the Site are former borrow pits. The area directly east of the Site is wetland/woodland. The other areas surrounding the Site are residential. The Site is bordered by wetlands serving as headwaters for Hewitt Brook to the east, a residential area to the south, and U.S. Route 7 to the west. The Town of Bennington (Town) purchased the Site in 1985. Several Bennington industries dumped liquid wastes into an unlined lagoon on the Site from 1969 to 1975. Town records indicate that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (i.e. solvents), and lead were disposed of at the Site. The lagoon was closed in 1975 after attempts by workers failed to dry it up by landfilling it. An underground drainage system built in 1976 was designed to lower the groundwater level below the landfill waste. The system discharged through a culvert into an unlined, ponded area. In 1986, the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation (VT DEC) detected contaminants in the groundwater discharging from the culvert into the ponded area. Approximately 2,200 residents located within 3 miles of the Site use private wells. The area surrounding the Site is mainly rural residential. Morgan Spring, a bedrock water source located 3 miles south of the landfill, is used regularly to supplement the Bennington water system.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The response actions performed at the Bennington Landfill Site have reduced threats to public health and the environment. A multi-barrier landfill cap was constructed over the entire landfill with a collection system to address landfill gases. Contamination has been covered by the cap. A leachate collection system was installed in 1997 and was later decommissioned in 2008 by the Town of Bennington because the system was generating little to no leachate. Maintenance and monitoring of the remedy continues to be performed by the Town with oversight by VT DEC and EPA to protect the public and the environment.

The Site was addressed in a two phase approach. The first phase consisted of a Non-Time-Critical Removal Action (NTCRA) which involved the placement of a cap on the landfill, diversion of surface and groundwater, and collection and treatment of the discharge from the underdrain. The second phase consisted of a comprehensive remedial investigation (RI), that confirmed that no further action beyond the NTCRA was necessary.

Initial Action: In 1994, the EPA and the potentially responsible parties began a short-term action to minimize the migration of contaminants from the landfill into the groundwater. An agreement between the EPA, State, and potentially responsible parties, to conduct work was finalized in 1997. These actions consisted of installing a composite, low permeability cap with drainage controls over the Site, excavating contaminated soils and sediments and consolidating them within the existing landfill, collecting the site leachate, managing the landfill gases, and providing site management and institutional controls. Design work for the landfill cap began in December 1996, construction began in September 1997, and the landfill cap was completed in 1999.

Entire Site: A potentially responsible party began the RI to determine the nature and extent of contamination at the Site in mid-1991. The study also assessed the risks to human health and the environment. The investigation was completed in 1997. A No Further Action Record of Decision (ROD) was signed by EPA in September 1998. The ROD is the final action at the site. All cleanup activities are in the long- term operation and maintenance phase.

Monitoring & Inspections: Regular monitoring and inspections occur at the Site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1999 the remedy for this Site was completed and has shown to be effective and protective of human health and the environment through EPA's and VT DEC's long-term monitoring program and Five-Year Review process. EPA, in consultation with VT DEC, will continue to perform [the FYRs](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0101493&doc=Y&colid=32717&region=01&type=SC) to assure that the remedy remains effective and protective.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**
This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.

The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
