### Background

On September 28, 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) placed the Colonial Creosote site in Washington Parish, LA on the National Priorities List (NPL) of Superfund sites, a list of sites that pose risks to people's health and the environment. Superfund is the federal program that investigates and cleans up the most complex, uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites in the country and converts them into productive community resources by eliminating or reducing public health risks and environmental contamination.  
  
The site, a 32-acre property in southeast Bogalusa, operated as a wood-treating facility from 1911 to 1953, with creosote used as the primary preservative. The site most recently housed Bogalusa Concrete, which operated until 2008. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality referred the site to EPA for evaluation in 2011.  
  
Creosote contamination has been found in soil, sediment, and ground water near the site. The contamination, mainly in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), have migrated from the facility to underlying groundwater, adjacent wetlands and nearby surface waters. Certain PAHs are suspected causes of cancer in humans, and have been shown to cause reproductive problems and birth defects in animals.  
  
Recent academic research, from the study [Superfund Cleanups and Infant Health](http://www.nber.org/papers/w16844), demonstrated that investment in Superfund cleanups reduces the incidence of congenital abnormalities for those living within 5,000 meters (or 5,468 yards) of a site. Another [study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069612001167) conducted by researchers at Duke and Pittsburgh Universities, concluded that making a site final on the NPL may increase housing prices by signaling that a site will be cleaned up. Furthermore, the study found that once a site has all cleanup remedies in place, nearby properties have a significant increase in property values as compared to pre-NPL proposal values.  
  
With all NPL sites, EPA works to identify companies or people responsible for the contamination at a site, and requires them to conduct or pay for the cleanup. For the newly listed sites without viable potentially responsible parties, EPA will investigate the extent of the contamination before assessing how best to treat it. TThe list serves as the basis for prioritizing both enforcement actions and long-term EPA Superfund cleanup funding; only sites on the NPL are eligible for such funding.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

RI/FS Process and On-going Activities

The first step of the remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) process is to have a work plan in place that describes the work to be done. The RI is designed to determine the nature and extent of contamination, and the FS evaluates various ways to deal with the contamination at the site. The RI/FS Work Plan and support plans describe:

1\. Sampling activities, including the number of type of samples to be collected

2\. Sampling procedures

3\. Health and safety precautions

4\. Community outreach activities

5\. Quality assurance procedures

The Work Plan for the Colonial Creosote RI/FS was finalized on June 17, 2016. The support plans that were later approved include:

Sampling and Analysis Plan

Health and Safety Plan

Site Management Plan

The RI/FS process normally ends with the release of the RI/FS documents and the development of the Proposed Plan for remedial action in cleaning up the site. The Proposed Plan will also serve as an effective communication device for the EPA to present its preferred remedy and rational to the community.

On June 6, 2017, EPA conducted an information meeting and availability session to answer questions residents or interested parties had about the Superfund Process. The first phase of field sampling occurred the same week and concluded on June 23, 2017. Phased field activites resumed on February 17, 2020 and concluded on February 25, 2020. Outreach efforts will continue throughout the implementation of the phased RI/FS and the public will be kept abreast on future site activities.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA conducted an Information Meeting on April 2017. The intent of this meeting was to meet with residents and collect needed information to develop the site's Community Involvement Plan, and answer questions concerning the site and the Superfund Process. Attendees were also informed of EPA's plans to start a phased investigation this summer. Another meeting was conducted on June 6, 2017, during which EPA team members met with the community members and explain the Superfund Process and introduced themselves and explained their roles. Sampling activities resumed the week of February 17, 2020 and EPA provided a site update on February 18, 2020 to the City of Bogalusa City Council and the community. Community feedback will continue to be soliciated throughout the process..
