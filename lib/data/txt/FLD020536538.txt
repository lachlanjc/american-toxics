### Background

The 3-acre Anaconda Aluminum Co./Milgo Electronics Corp. site is located in Miami, Florida. It includes the area where electrochemical aluminum coating operations took place from 1957 to 1984. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1990 because of contaminated groundwater and soil resulting from facility operations. EPA, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), and Anaconda Aluminum Company and Milgo Electronics Corporation, the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs), have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. After PRPs removed all soil contamination, EPA determined that the site no longer threatened people living or working near the site or the environment. EPA did not require further cleanup activities and took the site off the NPL in 1998.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Anaconda Aluminum Company and Milgo Electronics Corporation, the site’s PRPs, led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and FDEP.

In 1993, site PRPs removed all contaminated soils. Follow-up investigations confirmed that the site no longer posed a threat to public health or the environment. PRPs completed required groundwater monitoring in 1995. In 1998, EPA determined that the site did not threaten human health or the environment and took the site off the NPL. EPA no longer requires the completion of Five-Year Reviews for the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The three-acre site is located at 3630 Northwest 76th Street in an industrial area in Miami, Florida. Electrochemical aluminum coating operations occurred at the site from 1957 until 1983. The site includes a one-acre area, where Anaconda Aluminum Company operated from 1971 until 1983 and a 0.5-acre area where Milgo Electronic Corporation operated from 1961 until 1984. A mobile home park borders the site to the east. Railroad tracks border the site to the south. Industrial and commercial businesses border the site to the north and west. Surrounding land uses include industrial, commercial and residential land uses. Several other Superfund sites are located within a few miles of the site. In 1990, EPA listed the site on the NPL. Industrial operations, warehouses and a boat manufacturing facility currently operate at the site.

- In 1994, EPA issued the cleanup plan (a Record of Decision, or ROD) for the site. It documented EPA’s decision that no cleanup action was required.
- EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 1998 and does not require Five-Year Reviews for the site.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRPs to investigate and clean up the site. The PRPs funded site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
