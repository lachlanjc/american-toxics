### Background

The 24-acre McGraw Edison Corporation site is located in Calhoun County, Michigan. The company made air conditioners, humidifiers and similar equipment from 1958 until 1980. From 1970 to 1980, the company spread about 15,000 gallons of "still-bottoms" (an oil waste) on the site's dirt roads to control dust. The oil waste contained trichloroethylene (TCE), which contaminated two on-site water supply wells and 45 nearby residential wells. Following cleanup of contaminated soils, operation and maintenance activities for long-term groundwater cleanup are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and PRP actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that remedies are functioning as intended. EPA is not conducting further five-year reviews at the site because EPA did not select the remedy for the site; the remedy was selected in a Consent Decree between the State of Michigan and the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs). EPA was not a signatory to the Consent Decree. MDEQ staff is currently evaluating unresolved issues from previous five-year reviews and continues to work in cooperation with EPA and the PRPs to remove contaminants from the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included the excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil, soil flushing of remaining contaminated soil, and groundwater extraction and treatment. To protect human health, the public water supply has been extended to all affected residents; however, several residents refused hookup. Operation of the soil flushing system took place from 1992 to 1997. All remedial activities finished by 1997. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Trichloroethylene (TCE) is the contaminant found at the site.
