### Background

The Raritan Bay Slag site is in the Laurence Harbor section of Old Bridge and in Sayreville, New Jersey. Sea Land Development Corporation constructed the Laurence Harbor seawall and the western jetty using slag, which is waste from the bottom of industrial blast furnaces used to smelt metal in the late 1960s to early 1970s.

Waste impacted about 2,500 feet of the seawall. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Projection (NJDEP) identified elevated concentrations of [lead](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/substances/ToxSubstance.aspx?toxid=22), [antimony](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/substances/ToxSubstance.aspx?toxid=58), [arsenic](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/substances/ToxSubstance.aspx?toxid=30) and [copper](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/substances/ToxSubstance.aspx?toxid=37) along the seawall near the area where the processing byproducts were deposited. While NJDEP investigated the site within the seawall area, another area of concern was identified on the Sayreville waterfront. This area consists of the western jetty at the Cheesequake Creek inlet and waterfront area.

At the request of NJDEP, EPA evaluated the Raritan Bay Slag site for a short-term cleanup action under the federal Superfund program. EPA added a 47-acre property associated with Margret’s Creek in March 2009 to the site after discovering slag and battery casings in the area.

The overall site is approximately 1.5 miles in length and consists of the waterfront area between Margaret’s Creek and the areas just beyond the western jetty at the Cheesequake Creek Inlet. The site is divided into three sectors based on the type of environment and proximity to source areas. These sectors include the Seawall Sector, the Jetty Sector, and the Margaret’s Creek Sector.

Waves in Raritan Bay flow predominantly from the east and northeast (from the Atlantic Ocean). Contaminants from the Seawall and Margaret’s Creek Sectors tend to migrate westward. Currents near the Jetty Sector are complex due to strong tidal currents within Cheesequake Creek. EPA is addressing these sectors in a specific sequence to prevent recontamination of cleaned up areas. To prevent recontamination, EPA first cleaned up the Margaret’s Creek Sector, is now focused on the Seawall Sector, and will end with the Jetty Sector.

The primary sources of site contamination are slag from a lead process and battery casings. The Seawall is built out of up to 80 percent lead slag. EPA found battery casings along the Seawall Sector. The agency also discovered buried slag during test excavations, or removals, on the upland side and the eastern end of the seawall.

The Western Jetty and adjacent areas contain slag and some battery casings. Contamination in the western side of the Western Jetty and the adjacent shoreline is comprised of 80 to 90 percent slag. The currents near the Western Jetty deposit sediment on the western side of the jetty and transport the sediment into Raritan Bay.

Margaret’s Creek did contain visible slag waste piles in upland areas of the Creek and crushed battery casings scattered in upland areas of Margaret’s Creek. EPA didn’t find slag or battery casings in wetland sediment. EPA cleaned up this portion of the site in 2018.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

A local government official advised NJDEP in September 1972 that lead-contaminated waste material was being disposed of along the Laurence Harbor beachfront on Raritan Bay.

NJDEP found high levels of lead along the southern shoreline of the Raritan Bay adjacent to the Old Bridge Waterfront Park in 2007. NJDEP worked with Old Bridge officials to notify the public about health concerns from the lead waste material and restricted access by posting signs and some fencing.

EPA received a request from NJDEP in April 2008 to evaluate the Laurence Harbor seawall for a removal action under the [Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-cercla-overview) (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund law. EPA collected samples at the site in September 2008 as part of an assessment to determine whether further action under CERCLA was needed.

NJDEP requested for EPA to include the Western Jetty along the Cheesequake Creek Inlet as part of the overall site in November 2008. EPA collected soil, sediment, water, biological, and slag samples from along the seawall in Laurence Harbor, the Western Jetty at the Cheesequake Creek Inlet, the beaches near these two locations, and the developed portion of the park.

EPA and NJDEP found that the sampling results showed elevated levels of lead and other heavy metals present in the soil, sediment, and surface water in and around both the seawall in Laurence Harbor and the Western Jetty at the Cheesequake Creek Inlet.

At EPA’s request, the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (NJDHSS), in cooperation with the [Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/) (ATSDR), evaluated the sampling data of the site. Due to the elevated lead levels, a public health hazard exists at the seawall in Laurence Harbor, the beach between the western end of the seawall and the first jetty, and the Western Jetty at the Cheesequake Creek Inlet. This includes the waterfront area immediately west of the Cheesequake Creek inlet.

EPA installed permanent fences and posted signs to restrict access to these areas and informed residents and those using these areas of the health hazard that exists.

EPA added the 47‐acre property associated with Margaret’s Creek to the site in March 2009. EPA added the site to the NPL in November 2009.

EPA completed a detailed investigation of the extent of contamination and did a study to examine cleanup options, called a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS), in June 2011. Based on this information, EPA issued a cleanup plan for the site, in the form of a [Record of Decision](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/02/684125) (ROD), in May 2013.

After Superstorm Sandy in 2012, EPA assessed the site for damage. As a result, EPA removed battery casings from the Margaret’s Creek Sector that were exposed by the storm, potentially exposing people in this sector to contaminants. EPA completed removing the surface battery casings in the sector in May 2016.

EPA completed a full cleanup of the Margaret’s Creek sector of the site in September 2018. EPA also restored impacted wetland areas and continues to monitor these areas to ensure that they are viable as wetlands.

The Margaret’s Creek cleanup, which included removing approximately 15,775 tons of soil and 1,802 tons of slag from this portion of the site, cost about $7 million. This was far less than the original 2013 ROD cleanup cost-estimate of approximately $14,200,000 for this area.

EPA negotiated with NL Industries (NL) and the other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) to conduct the remaining work at the site. Consistent with this, NL agreed to complete the engineering design work for the planned cleanup action for the Seawall Sector. NL began working on this in late 2019.

However, after multiple rounds of detailed input, on August 20, 2021, [EPA informed NL](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/625144.pdf) that EPA would take over completing the design plans to support the Seawall Sector of the site cleanup. By taking over the work, EPA would ensure that the design is completed in a technically sound manner that will lead to a successful cleanup of the Seawall Sector.

Fall 2021, EPA initiated the development of the Seawall Sector Remedial Design and the design was finalized and approved on September 27, 2023.

In addition, EPA has started design work for the Jetty Sector of the site and is working towards being able to begin cleanup work there once work at the Seawall Sector is complete.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

September 5, 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced a proposed consent decree that would pay EPA’s past and future costs of cleanup at the Raritan Bay Slag Superfund Site in Old Bridge Township and Sayreville, New Jersey. The proposed consent decree requires parties identified as potentially responsible for the site, to pay $151.1 million. EPA will receive $132.4 million as reimbursement for past work and to pay for the remaining cleanup work at the site. The consent decree also would resolve the claims of the Natural Resource Trustees, which will receive $18.7 million.

On September 27, 2023, EPA finalized the Remedial Design for the Seawall Sector.

Currently, EPA is working to get a contractor on board to implement the Remedial Design for the Seawall Sector.
