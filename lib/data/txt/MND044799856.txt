Background
The 36-acre Joslyn Manufacturing & Supply Company site is in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, and nearby to Twin Lake. Wood-treating operations took place at the site from the 1920s until closing in 1980. Spills of wood-treating solution contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Waste from these processes was placed in on-site disposal ponds. Process sludge was buried on the site. In 1984, the site was listed on the National Priorities List due to extensive soil and ground water contamination. Much of the contaminated soil at the property was cleaned up by 1997. EPA deleted portions of the site from the NPL in 2000.  Cleanup of groundwater and soil in OU5, also known as the West Area, is ongoing.  Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In 1984, EPA listed the site on the National Priorities List – a list of the nation’s most hazardous waste sites. As part of EPA's Enforcement Deferral Pilot Project, MPCA is the lead agency overseeing cleanup and enforcement for the site. In 1985, MPCA and Joslyn Manufacturing and Supply Co. entered into an agreement to investigate and clean up the site. Complex cleanup sites are often divided into smaller segments called Operable Units, or OUs. This site consists of five operable units. OU1, 2, and 3 consist of different segments of groundwater contamination. 0U4 refers to contaminated soils at the site. And OU5, also known as the West Area, is mostly forested with trees and shrubs, but does comprise of some wetlands. OU5 was not used for significant operations associated with wood treating but became impacted by surface-water runoff from areas where wood-treating operations were conducted. MPCA selected a cleanup plan for portions of the site in 1989. The selected remedy for groundwater included installation of pump out wells and long-term groundwater monitoring at OU1 and 2. A recovery system was installed to collect waste wood-treating chemicals present in the aquifer as dense non-aqueous phase liquid in OU3. The remedy for OU4 included on-site treatment of soils through biological degradation of contaminants. MPCA’s cleanup plan also allowed for the off-site disposal of soils that could not be treated on-site. From 1989 through 1998, approximately 85,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil were remediated onsite. Contaminated soils left on-site were capped by buildings, and a clean soil layer in other areas. EPA deleted the eastern parts of the site from the NPL in 2002. Over the last decade, this part of the site has been redeveloped for industrial use. MPCA’s most recent review of the site concluded that the cleanup remedies carried out at the site so far continue to protect human health and the environment.

What Is the Current Site Status?
In 2018, MPCA selected a remedy for the remaining soil contamination at OU5.  Cleanup activities at OU5 began in late fall 2022 and will continue through mid-2023. The remediation plan includes excavation of contaminated soils and transportation to a permitted landfill. Remaining soils will be consolidated on-site and covered with a clean cap. To implement this remedy, workers will remove some trees in OU5. New trees will be planted, and wetland areas will be restored following cleanup. Site-wide groundwater treatment and monitoring are ongoing.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
 The
primary contaminants in groundwater at the site are pentachlorophenol (PCP) and
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). 
Dioxins also are present in contaminated soil remaining in the West Area.

Enforcement Information
The site is part of EPAs Enforcement Deferral Pilot Agreement with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and MPCA is the primary agency overseeing cleanup at the site. Top of Page
