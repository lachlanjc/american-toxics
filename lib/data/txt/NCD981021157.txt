### Background

The New Hanover County Airport Burn Pit site is located in Wilmington, North Carolina. It includes an area where firefighters used a burn pit for training purposes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1989 because of contaminated groundwater resulting from operations and waste handling practices. EPA, the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (NCDENR), and the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. By monitoring groundwater and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, NCDENR and the site’s PRPs have protected people and the environment from site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The 4-acre site is located on Gardener Drive in Wilmington, New Hanover County, North Carolina. The site includes a 1,500-square-foot burn pit located near the center of the site. The Wilmington International Airport, also known as the New Hanover County International Airport, borders the site to the north, south and east. Railroad tracks, Blue Clay Road and a wooded area border the site to the west. The nearest residence is located 1,100 feet west of the site, in a residential area across Blue Clay Road. The site’s broader surroundings include commercial, industrial and residential land uses. Residential areas include some low-income residents. During World War II, the site operated as a military hospital. The dates of the original burn pit operations are unknown. From 1968 until 1979, parties used a second burn pit at the site for firefighter training purposes. Parties burned jet fuel, gasoline, petroleum storage tank bottoms, fuel oil, kerosene and sorbent materials from oil spill cleanups in the pit. Firefighters used 100 to 500 gallons of ignitable fuel for each training exercise. The exercises used water as the primary fire extinguishing agent. However, exercises also used carbon dioxide and dry chemicals. In 1985, New Hanover County found contamination in sludge in the pit. In 1989, the EPA listed the site on the NPL. In the 1990s, the site’s PRPs conducted cleanup activities to address soil contamination. The site is not in use. The site can support commercial and light industrial uses.

The site’s PRPs led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and NCDENR.

- In 1999, the site’s PRPs completed the collection of additional groundwater data.
- In 2000, the PRPs installed additional wells and resampled monitoring wells at the site.
- In 2002, the PRPs began monitoring groundwater semi-annually. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing.

EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy is protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

- In 1993, EPA issued a cleanup plan (a Record of Decision, or ROD) for the site. The plan included collecting additional groundwater data; performing a treatability study to evaluate groundwater contamination; extracting contaminated groundwater; treating contaminated groundwater on site in an aboveground treatment system; pretreating groundwater to remove suspended solids and iron; using air stripping as part of groundwater treatment; and discharging treated groundwater to the local water treatment plant.
- EPA updated the remedy in 2000 to include the use of air sparging as part of site cleanup activities.
- Ground water monitoring is complete.
- The Environmental Protection Agency deleted the New Hanover County Airport Burn Pit Superfund Site (from the National Priorities List (NPL). EPA and the State of North Carolina have determined that all appropriate response actions under CERCLA are complete. The Notice of Deletion was signed by the Regional Administrator on August 28, 2012 and published in the Federal Register on September 20, 2012.
- EPA completed the last Five-Year Review in 2013 and concluded that response actions, in accordance with the remedy selected is protective of human health and the environment.

### Enforcement Information

EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRPs to investigate and clean up the site. The PRPs continue to fund site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
