Background
The 9.8-acre Crown Cleaners of Watertown Inc. site is located on Route 3 along the Black River near Fort Drum in the Village of Herrings, New York. From 1890 until the mid-1960’s, the property was used by the St. Regis Paper Company to produce paper bags and related products. In the late 1970’s, the property was purchased by Crown Cleaners of Watertown, operating the facility as a fdry cleaning and laundry facility until 1991. Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and machine oils and greases were used in the dry cleaning process. Wastewater from the washing machines was discharged into basement storage pits, which then discharged through foundation walls to the ground and the Black River. Spent dry cleaning filters were deposited on the ground next to the building, contaminating the soils. In 1991, the New York State Department of Health, discovered that the Village of Herrings’ public water supply well was contaminated with PCE. An investigation by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) indicated that the soil and groundwater beneath the Crown Cleaners building were contaminated with PCE and other organic compounds. This investigation also indicated that the Crown Cleaners facility was the source of the PCE.  As a result of this study, a treatment system for the Village well was installed. On September 4, 2002, the site was listed on EPA’s Superfund National Priorities List. Initial cleanup actions by EPA included building demolition and removal of contaminated sludge, debris and waste oil. The site’s long-term cleanup is ongoing.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
 The site is being addressed in two phases: immediate actions and a long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site. Immediate Actions: Several New York State investigations were conducted at the site during the 1990’s which resulted in the site being referred to EPA for further evaluation in 2000.  EPA assessed the site for a possible removal action (removal actions are taken in response to a release or threat of release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant that may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare). Based on an evaluation of previous analytical data, historical information, and the removal site evaluation, EPA determined that the site posed an immediate threat to public health, welfare, and the environment. Actions taken to abate the threat included securing the site, removal and disposal of volatile organic-contaminated sludge/debris, sump pit water, and soils/spent dry cleaning filters, removal of friable asbestos-containing materials, and removal, demolition of an unstable portion of the facility building, and disposal of waste oil. Long-Term Cleanup: EPA conducted field investigations at the site from 2004 through 2011, which culminated in the completion of a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS). This RI/FS determined the nature and extent of the contamination, evaluated the risk to public health and ecological receptors and  identified and evaluated remedial alternatives. A Record of Decision was signed on March 29, 2012. The selected remedy includes the demolition of all site buildings, excavating contaminated soil and wetland sediment, and treating the groundwater through in-situ chemical injections at source areas and monitored natural attenuation for the groundwater with lower contaminant concentrations located outside the source areas. Because volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have the ability to move through the soil and contaminate groundwater, all of the excavated soil contaminated with VOCs were sent to a licensed off-site disposal facility. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) compounds in the soil will be properly managed on-site by covering them up with clean soil (PAH compounds are not found in the groundwater). Any wetlands disturbed will be restored. The plan also requires restrictions that will prevent activities that could disturb the cleaned up areas and will prohibit any future residential construction on the site property.
Following the completion of the designs of the various components of the selected remedy, remedial work commenced.  The building demolition was completed in 2015 and soil excavation activities were completed in 2016. Additional soils were excavated in 2018. Installation of injection wells for the groundwater treatment system and the initial injection of oxidants were completed in 2016. The second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh rounds of injections were completed in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 respectively. An eighth round of injections will be performed in spring 2025.
