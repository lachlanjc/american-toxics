### Background

**Current Status**

Results of the groundwater sampling event conducted on April 9th and 10th, 2008, indicated that no wells contained contaminants above the remedial goals. Additionally, no wells had concentrations above MCLs in the Upper Wilcox aquifer. A second five year review was completed in the summer of 2009. This five year review concluded that this site will be deleted from the NPL, and all groundwater monitoring has been terminated. The Final Closeout Report for the Site was signed by EPA on April 30, 2014, and EPA published a Notice of Deletion for the Site in the Federal Register on August 14, 2014. No comments were received on the proposed deletion and the site was deleted from the NPL effective September 29, 2014**.**

**Site Background**

The 7-acre Monroe Auto Equipment Co. (Paragould Pit) site is located near Paragould, Arkansas. Monroe Auto Equipment deposited nearly 15,000 cubic yards of alum and lime electroplating sludge/slurry at the site in an abandoned sand and gravel pit. These activities contaminated soil and groundwater with solvents, degreasing agents and metals. Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring were started after construction of the remedy was completed. The results of the groundwater sampling indicated that no wells contained contaminants above the remedial goals. The five year review completed in 2009 recommended that the site be deleted from the NPL because all groundwater samples indicated that the remedial goals for the site had been met. The Final Closeout Report for the Site was signed by EPA in April 2014 and the Site was deleted from the NPL on September 29, 2014.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and PRP actions.  
  
EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the siteâ€™s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The review recommended that the Site be removed from the NPL since all remedial goals had been acheived.

In 1973, Monroe Auto Equipment Company (now Tenneco Automotive, Inc.) purchased a 7-acre tract of land in Greene County, Arkansas. The area included an inactive sand and gravel borrow pit. From 1973 to 1978, Monroe Auto Equipment deposited nearly 15,000 cubic yards of alum and lime electroplating sludge/slurry at the site in the abandoned sand and gravel pit. The sludge originated from settling ponds that the company used for the treatment of wastewater from Monroe Auto Equipment's Paragould manufacturing plant.In 1973, Monroe Auto Equipment Company (now Tenneco Automotive, Inc.) purchased a 7-acre tract of land in Greene County, Arkansas.
