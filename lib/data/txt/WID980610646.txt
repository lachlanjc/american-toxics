### Background

The 38-acre City Disposal Corp. site is located in a predominantly agricultural area about one-half mile northeast of the city of Oregon and about 7 miles south of Madison. The site's main entry is a gravel road off Sand Hill Road. Badfish Creek lies near the site's eastern border. The landfill began operation in the mid-1960s. During that time, it accepted household, industrial and construction waste. Industrial waste included solvents from paint manufacturing, paint waste, and oily residues. The contaminant of concern was tetrahydrofuran. About 700,000 cubic yards of waste was disposed of there before it closed in 1977.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The cleanup was done in two phases. In 1994, landfill covers were built over the entire area. A landfill gas collection system was also installed along with trenches and piping. In 1997, the groundwater cleanup began which consisted of extraction and treatment. Construction continued until 2000 when a technology called a fixed-film bioreactor system came online. It routes water first to a wetland area and subsequently to Badfish Creek.

Site owner Waste Management of Wisconsin handles the necessary day-to-day operation and maintenance of the treatment facilities. EPA and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources oversee these activities and review effluent quality reports and other maintenance records.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is conducting a five-year review of the City Disposal Corp. Landfill. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This is the fifth review of the site.

More information is available at the Dunn Town Hall, 4156 County Road B, McFarland, and on this web page under Site Documents & Data. The review should be completed by February 2020.

The five-year-review is an opportunity for you to tell EPA about site conditions and any concerns you have. Contact the community involvement coordinator or remedial project manager.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Groundwater and soil are contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
