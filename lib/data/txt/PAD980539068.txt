### Background

The 66-acre Modern Sanitation Landfill site is located in Lower Windsor Township in York County, Pennsylvania. The site consists of part of an active, permitted landfill that accepts municipal and non-hazardous industrial waste. The site was formerly a farm used as a landfill for open domestic dumping beginning in the 1940s. This landfill reportedly received hazardous wastes between 1976 and 1979. Past disposal practices at the landfill contaminated soil, groundwater and surface water with hazardous chemicals. The Site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in June 1986. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

On June 28, 1991, EPA issued the Record of Decision (ROD) that documents the selected remedy for the 66-acre site. The ROD acknowledged that Modern had performed substantial remedial activities under the supervision of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) as part of PADEP's permitting of the landfill expansions at the Site. Remedial activities included:

- Construction of a PADEP-approved low permeability cap (62 of 66 acres);
- Construction of groundwater extraction systems on the eastern and western perimeters of the Site with groundwater restoration as the goal of remediation;
- Construction of fencing around the portions of the Site both west and east of Prospect Road;
- Construction of the on-site wastewater treatment facility;
- Construction of the on-site landfill gas (i.e. vapor) extraction system; and,
- Development of a surface water and groundwater monitoring network.

The ROD determined that, based on the remedial activities previously performed at the site, the following additional remedial activities were required:

- Continued operation and maintenance of all previous remedial actions conducted on-site, including the landfill cap, groundwater extraction systems, on-site wastewater treatment facility, gas extraction system (for removal and destruction of landfill generated methane gas), and groundwater and surface water monitoring;
- Completion of the landfill cap system and final cover for the 66-acre landfill;
- Maintenance of site fencing and all access restriction;
- Addition of extraction wells to the eastern and western extraction systems to prevent contaminated groundwater from bypassing those systems;
- Completion of additional monitoring and/or extraction wells as needed to ensure protectiveness and to control groundwater flow, respectively; and,
- As a goal, restoration of contaminated groundwater to background quality.

The groundwater extraction system was originally expected to operate until background levels of contaminants are reached. The attainment area for this remediation is located between the site boundary and the groundwater compliance monitoring and assessment points, all of which are located within the property boundary owned or leased by Modern Landfill.  
  
On February 25, 2015, EPA issued an [Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/03/2201670.pdf) which modified the groundwater remediation goals for individual contaminants at the site from “background” to the applicable Safe Drinking Water Act maximum contaminant level (MCL). For contaminants that did not have an MCL, the revised groundwater remediation goal is now the medium specific concentration established in the Pennsylvania Land Recycling and Environmental Remedial Standards Act (Act 2). This ESD also set the requirement for a cumulative risk evaluation for groundwater. Finally, the 2015 ESD added institutional controls to protect the integrity of remedies put in place.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and functioning as intended by the site decision documents. The most recent [2025 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2421961), found that the implemented remedy is currently protective of human health and the environment. The cap and cover systems installed over the 66-acre site is functioning properly and prevents direct exposure to landfill waste. The groundwater remedy is functioning as intended by the decision documents and intercepts impacted groundwater flowing beneath the 66-acre unlined landfill. Institutional controls are in place to protect the integrity of remedial components and prevent drilling of groundwater wells within impacted areas. All exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks are being controlled. However, for the remedy to be protective over the long term, the report recommends that the EPA sample groundwater for PFAS compounds to determine if the presence of PFAS is related to the site.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls are in place to restrict groundwater use and protect cap. Additional information about the institutional controls are available in the [2020 Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/03/2297919.pdf) (page 13).

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In the mid-1980s, the potentially responsible party (PRP) constructed two groundwater extraction systems and a wastewater treatment plant.
