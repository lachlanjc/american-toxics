### Background

The 5,347-acre George Air Force Base was established in World War II and closed in December 1992. Its mission was to support tactical fighter operations and provide training for air crews and maintenance personnel that mandated the use and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials. Site investigations and long-term cleanup are ongoing.

George Air Force Base (AFB) is located approximately 70 miles northeast of Los Angeles and occupies 5,347 acres and is located in San Bernardino County, California near the cities of Victorville and Adelanto. The base was established during World War II in the early 1940s and was closed in December 1992. Its mission was to support tactical fighter operations and provided training for air crews and maintenance personnel. To meet mission requirements, the base engaged in a variety of support operations such as aircraft maintenance and firefighting training that mandated the use and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials. At least 50 years of military aircraft operations resulted in various contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) being released into soil and leaching into groundwater, potentially impacting human health and the environment.

Eighty-four Installation Restoration Program sites with potential chemical contamination have been identified at George AFB. Five Operational Units (OUs) have been created under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) to manage these sites. As of 2019, OU1, OU3, and OU5 remain active at George AFB. OU2 and OU4 have been dissolved and were realigned into other OUs or identified as non-CERCLA sites.

OU1 Sites

OU1 consists of three sites: Site SD025 (the Industrial Storm Drain), Site WP026 (the sewage treatment plant percolation ponds), and Site CG070 (dissolved TCE plume, northeast of the base and the Northeast Disposal Area (NEDA)). In the 1994 OU1 Record of Decision (ROD), Sites SD025 and WP026 were determined to be No Further Action (NFA) sites and CG070 was the only site requiring remediation. Source areas to CG070 include SD025, FT082 (being remediated under OU5) and FT019 (being remediated under OU3). These sources have been controlled or remediated. The Air Force (AF) began operation of a Groundwater Extraction and Treatment System (GET) in 1992 as an interim remedial action. The ROD for the GET was signed in 1994. The ROD remedy included discharge to the Upper Aquifer (UA) using infiltration ponds; discharge to an arroyo and to the Base Golf Course; quarterly groundwater monitoring and deed restrictions prohibiting groundwater use. In 2001 after 12 years of operation and extraction of 1.56 billion gallons to remove 232 pounds of TCE (19 gallons) the Base Closure Team (BCT) determined that the GET was not operating as intended and optimization was necessary. Specifically, the selected remedy did not meet the remedial action objective of eliminating or reducing “the potential for further migration of the existing trichloroethylene (TCE) plume in groundwater”. The GET was shut down in 2003. A 2011 Final Focused Feasibility Study was completed based on groundwater modeling. A Draft Proposed Plan was developed in 2014 for ROD Amendment. The proposed remedy includes Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) Institutional Controls (ICs) and a water supply contingency plan. However, due to the timeframe projected to reach the cleanup goals under the proposed MNA remedy, this remedy has not yet received regulatory concurrence. To address the timeframe concern the Regulatory Agencies recommended the use of enhanced reductive dechlorination and the AF is evaluating to reduce the cleanup time.

OU3 Sites

OU3 consists of 60 Installation Restoration Program (IRP) sites. OU3 sites include of a variety of contaminant source areas, including landfills, other waste disposal and storage sites, fire-training areas, spill sites, leach fields, and groundwater plumes. In 1998 a ROD was signed for OU 3. This ROD specified remedies for the 60 IRP sites. The Fourth Five Year Review dated November 2016 summarizes the remedial actions taken at OU 3. The following sites are undergoing remedial actions including Sites DP033 and DP034 (military munitions response sites (MMRP) pending Explanation of Significant Differences \[ESDs\]); FT019a (bioventing) and FT019c (soil vapor extraction \[SVE\]); Site ZZ051 (SVE); Site OT069 (additional investigation); Sites DP003 (Long Term Monitoring and Maintenance \[LTMM\]), DP004 (LTMM), LF012 (LTMM), LF014 (LTMM), and LF044 (RODA under development); LF007 (LTMM); WP040 and SS052 (MMRP ESDs pending); and XU400 and SR401 (Remedial Investigation MMRP).

OU5 Sites

OU5 was created in 2006 to manage two soil sources (FT082 and SS083) for dissolved solvent plumes in groundwater (OU1 Site CG70 and OU3 Site OT69). The sources were identified after completion of the OU1 and OU3 RODs. OU5 includes five sites, OT072 (Current Skeet Range), OT073 (Second Skeet Range, MMRP Site SR406), OT074 (Original Skeet Range, MMRP Site SR405), FT082 (Fire Training Area), and SS083 (Spill Site, Aircraft Maintenance Hangar Building 676). In 2011, a Focused Feasibility Study for OU5 was submitted and the Proposed Plan was finalized in 2013. The final ROD for was signed on May 28, 2015. For OT72, OT73, and OT74, the OU5 ROD defined remedial goals of removal of contamination and protection of human health and the environment. The ROD documented that the goals were met and the site meets the conditions for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure (UU/UE). These three sites have been addressed with Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analyses, removal actions, and a recommended No Further Action determination as noted in the Final Closure Report for the Current Skeet Range in 2002 and the 2003 Final Site Closure Report for the Original and Second Skeet Range. The skeet ranges are not sources of groundwater contamination and no monitoring is being performed. The AF has implemented SVE as the interim presumptive remedy at Sites FT082 and SS083. The ROD for Sites FT082 and SS083 is currently being developed.

Non-CERCLA Sites

The non-CERCLA sites include the Building 12 Base Exchange Station, the oil water separator (OWS), the Buckeye Site, and Sites SS030, ST031, ST054, ST057, SS058, ST067a, ST067b, OT071, SS079, OT081, and SS084. These sites have been removed from the CERCLA process because they are petroleum sties or result from non-CERCLA sources. Corrective action for non-CERCLA petroleum sites is being overseen by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB). The AF is remediating the petroleum sites using soil vapor extraction (SVE) and free product recovery.

Contaminants and Risks

Media affected at George AFB include groundwater, soil and sludge, and munitions and explosives of concern.

Groundwater is contaminated with jet fuel, trichloroethylene (TCE), pesticides, and nitrates. Soil is contaminated with total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs), dioxins, construction debris, medical wastes, pesticides, semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), and various inorganic compounds. Accidental ingestion of or direct contact with the contaminants may pose a health risk.

OU1 – OU1 is contaminated by a TCE groundwater plume in the northeastern base area (Site CG070). Nitrate is also present in OU1 groundwater above drinking water standards. The nitrate originates from Site WP026, the Sewage Treatment Plant Percolation Ponds.

OU2 – OU2 is contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons (jet fuel) in groundwater from soil (the source).

OU3 – Contaminated groundwater sites at OU3 include landfills, disposal areas, and the Southeast Disposal Area (SEDA) that have been impacted by fuels, oils, and solvents. No contaminants of concern (COCs) were identified in surface or subsurface soil above screening criteria during the remedial investigation (RI) at Site LF044. Groundwater at Site LF044 (monitoring well NZ-80) contains nitrate and TCE at concentrations above the maximum contaminant level (MCL). The primary COC at Site FT019a remains TPH as TPG-gasoline (TPH-g) but also includes benzene, TPH-diesel (TPH-d) and xylenes as COCs. At FT019c, TCE is the primary COC but also includes ethylbenzene, TPH-d, TPH-g and xylenes. COCs at OT069 include tetrachloroethene (PCE), TCE, cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-1,2-DCE), and 1,1-dichloroethane (1,1-DCA) in groundwater. Several sites are being assessed for MMRP including Sites DP033, DP034, WP040, SS052, XU400, and SR401.

OU4 – OU4 was created in 2005 to address eight soil sites, five of which were closed as No Further Response Action Planned sites in 2008 and the remaining three sites were transferred to OU5.

OU5 – Three skeet ranges and sites FT082 and SS083, which were identified in 2006 as contributing sources of TCE in groundwater at OU1 Site CG070 and OU3 Site OT069. TCE is the primary COC in groundwater at OU5.

Non-CERCLA sites – Site ZZ051 is contaminated with PAHs and TPH-g in soil and groundwater; Site ST054 is impacted by TPH-g, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX), and MTBE in soil vapor and groundwater; Site ST057 is impacted by TPH-g, BTEX, and MTBE in soil vapor and groundwater; Site ST067b is impacted by TPH-g, BTEX, and MTBE in soil vapor and groundwater; Site OT071 is impacted by dieldrin in groundwater; Site SS084 is impacted by TPH-g, BTEX, and MTBE in soil and groundwater; and Site SS030 is impacted by DCA, benzene, (cis-1,2-DCE), ethylbenzene, MTBE, and TCE in groundwater.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA, the state and the U.S. Air Force signed a Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) in October 1990 for cleaning up the base. The Air Force is the lead agency for site cleanup, with EPA and the State of California Lahontan RWQCB providing regulatory oversight through FFA Base Closure Team (BCT) procedures. The California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), formerly the California Department of Health Services, was part of the BCT until 1998 when they deferred roles and responsibilities to the RWQCB.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

To better manage site investigations and cleanup, three operable units (OUs) were established for the site. OU-1 is the 600-acre trichloroethylene (TCE) groundwater plume in the Northeast base area and extends off base. OU-3 is the landfills and/or disposal sites with other various soil sites contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). OU-5 is a TCE soil contamination source column over the OU-1 groundwater plume, and also includes three former skeet ranges. OU-2 was pulled out of the Superfund process in 2005 for state oversight. OU-4 and OU-5 were created and later combined as OU-5. OU-4 was to document completed response actions for miscellaneous sites that dropped out from OU-2.  

*Initial Actions:* In 1991, the Air Force began operating a pump-and-treat (PAT) system with air stripping for groundwater contaminated with TCE under OU-1's northeast base area that migrated off base. In early 1992, the Air Force started removing jet fuel (JP-4) free product at OU-2 using passive skimming technology, and supplemented soil vapor extraction (SVE) for removing VOCs from soils several years later. Remedial actions for various OU-3 sites started in the mid-1990s to remove VOCs from soil sites. A pilot SVE project in OU-5 addressed the TCE soil source column. Soils contaminated with metals were removed from the former skeet ranges.  

*OU-1 Northeast Base Area:* The long-term remedy, selected in 1994, included PAT and access controls for the TCE groundwater plume beneath the northeast base area. The flushing approach pushed TCE to the edge of the upper aquifer where it is "temporarily stored." It could take many decades for it to migrate or cascade into the lower aquifer. The steep terrain in the area prevents any efficient monitoring or remedial actions. The PAT system has been shut down since 2003; it was making the TCE migration problem worse. The Air Force discovered that Site FT-082 was a TCE soil source column to the OU-1 groundwater plume and implemented SVE in 2007 as a pilot project. A remedy update for the OU-1 groundwater plume is under development.

*OU-2 Jet Fuel Plume:* OU-2 has over two million gallons of free product in groundwater. Passive skimming to remove the jet fuel from groundwater started in 1992 and monitored natural attenuation was the planned supplement remedy. The Air Force implemented SVE at EPA’s request to remove VOCs from the contaminated soil. In March 2005, the Air Force withdrew OU-2 from the Superfund process and converted the cleanup management process to a Corrective Action Plan (CAP). The state assumed the regulatory lead.

*OU-3 Landfills, Disposal Areas and VOC Sites:* Selected remedies included capping and access controls for landfills/disposal areas, and bioventing or SVE for VOC sites. Response actions for the landfills/disposal areas were completed. Actions for VOC sites are ongoing.  

*OU-4 documented “no further action” decisions for following sites:* AOC 72/Current Skeet Range, AOC 73/Second Skeet Range, AOC 74/Original Skeet Range, AOC 75/Indoor Range, AOC76/Dozer Scar Area, AOC 77/Disturbed Area, AOC 78/Explosive Ordinance Disposal Training Area and AOC 80/Building 513. Skeet ranges were carried forward to OU-5. All other OU-4 sites were documented by the Air Force's 2008 No Further Response Action Report (NFRAP).  

OU-5 is mainly an active SVE system at Sites FT-082 and SS-083 put in place to remove the high TCE levels in soil acting as a source column to OU-1’s TCE groundwater plume. OU-5 also includes three closed Skeet Ranges that are not expected to require further action (OT072, OT073 and OT074). The long-term remedy for these areas is under development.

The Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) issued a Notice of Violation letter to the Air Force for dieldrin pesticide contamination in groundwater. The Air Force is only monitoring the pesticides in groundwater, as the levels are very low, but the plume has not been fully defined because of funding constraints. The Air Force would not consider EPA's request for an evaluation of the contamination extent in soil because the Air Force does not classify it as a CERCLA release to the environment; past general practices mandated the routine application of pesticides for termite control. The Air Force submitted another CAP document to address dieldrin; it is currently under State of California Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) review.  

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Victorville acts as the local reuse agency (LRA) for property leases from the AF until they can be transferred by deed to new owners. The proposed reuse for the former George AFB was the development of an international airport and railway hub, along with commercial, industrial, and business park development; however, this is on hold due to economic conditions. Former George AFB is reused for commercial and industrial purposes. The AF has transferred 4,196 acres to Southern California Logistics Airport Authority (SCLAA). Today, the former base is home to 17 aviation-related businesses and a community college program training aircraft mechanics. Manufacturing and distribution centers, a multi-million dollar power plant and a 900-acre federal prison complex operate at the former base. There are no plans for residential development on former base property according to the City of Victorville’s 2030 Specific Plan (https://www.victorvilleca.gov/Home/ShowDocument?id=143).

Potentially Responsible Parties

Potentially responsible parties (PRPs) refers to entities/companies that are potentially responsible for generating, transporting, or disposing hazardous waste found at the site.

The Air Force is the PRP for this site.
