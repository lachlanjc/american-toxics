### Background

The three-acre Distler Brickyard [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in West Point, Kentucky. The site includes an area where a brick manufacturer operated from the late 1800s to the mid-1970s. Waste handling and storage practices resulted in soil and groundwater contamination.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983 because of contaminated groundwater and soil resulting from operations at the site.

The EPA and the [Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection (KDEP)](https://eec.ky.gov/Environmental-Protection/Pages/default.aspx) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site. By collecting additional data and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, the EPA, KDEP and the site’s Potentially Responsible Party continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

The remedy at the site currently protects human health and the environment because there are currently no completed exposure pathways.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**1979**  
In 1979, the Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection (KDEP) ordered Kentucky Liquid Recycling Inc. to cease its operations at the site.

**1982**  
During initial site inspections, KDEP found 2,310 drums containing chemicals, stressed vegetation and stained soil, and dead grass, trees and birds. EPA removed 2,310 drums and 42 tractor-trailers of contaminated soil. EPA transported contaminated soil off site for incineration and backfilled, graded and seeded the excavated areas.

**1986**  
The site’s long-term remedy included:

- removing contaminated soil and disposing at an off-site facility,
- backfilling excavated areas with clean soil,
- grading and revegetating the backfilled areas,
- extracting and treating contaminated groundwater off site,
- reinjecting treated groundwater, and
- for a period of one year, operation and maintenance activities such as mowing, maintaining vegetation and repairing erosion.
**1988**  
The EPA updated the long-term remedy in 1988 to require cleanup of soil and groundwater to health-based criteria levels instead of the initial remedy which required cleanup to background levels.

**1994**  
KDEP began operating the site’s permanent groundwater treatment system.

**1998 - 2001**  
From 1998 to 2001, EPA and KDEP worked with the U.S. Geological Surveyand planned application of an innovative cleanup technology at the site. The technology combined hydraulic fracturing with injection of chitin (a slurry of shrimp and crab shells).

**2001 – 2004**  
The pilot application of the technology began in 2001. The full-scale project operated in 2003 and 2004.

**2008**  
Operation of the site’s groundwater treatment system ended.

**2015**  
Sampling yielded results with exceedances of the remediation goals.

**2023/2024**

EPA conducted five rounds of groundwater sampling to assess groundwater status. Intermittent exceedances of the respective maximum contaminant levels for trichloroethylene and arsenic were detected in several wells.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent [Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11189386) was published in July 2023. The remedy at the site currently protects human health and the environment because there are currently no completed exposure pathways. The Five-Year Review recommends continued groundwater sampling, conducting soil sampling, and evaluating the need for institutional controls.

EPA conducted five groundwater sampling events in 2023 and 2024 to assess the groundwater. Intermittent exceedances of the respective maximum contaminant levels for trichlroethylene and arsenic were detected in several wells. Soil sampling to evaluate the need for land-based institutional controls is planned in mid-2025.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, the EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) to fund site activities conducted by EPA and KDEP.
