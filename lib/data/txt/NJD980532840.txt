### Background

The Hopkins Farm site is located in Plumsted Township, New Jersey. Chemical wastes were disposed of on a small portion of the 57-acre area during the late 1950s and early 1960s, contaminating soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. The site is one of seven similar hazardous waste sites in the vicinity of Plumsted Township. Following cleanup, the site no longer poses a threat to human health or the environment. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in June 2002. Long-term groundwater monitoring is ongoing.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1987, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) started an investigation to determine the nature and extent of the contamination at the site. This investigation finished in 1991. In 1992 and 1994, a two-phase removal action removed contaminated soil from the site. A post-removal investigation took place in 1995. Data collected during the site investigations was used in the preparation of a risk assessment to evaluate human health and environmental risks posed by the site. After review of all site-related documentation, EPA and NJDEP determined that additional cleanup remedies would not be necessary. In 1996, EPA issued the Record of Decision (ROD) for the site. It called for no further action, with long-term groundwater monitoring to ensure that the site does not pose a threat to the surrounding area in the future.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site has been addressed in a single long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.  

The excavation and removal of approximately 1,441 tons of contaminated soils at the site have greatly reduced the potential for exposure to contaminants. In 1998, EPA finalized the monitoring program for the long term monitoring of the groundwater, surface water and sediments to assure protectiveness of human health and the environment.

In 2001, the PRP completed the required groundwater monitoring. Iron and aluminum were the only inorganic compounds detected above Federal and State standards. In November 2001, EPA evaluated the potential risk associated with the concentrations of iron and aluminum in the groundwater. EPA concluded that exposure to iron and aluminum in groundwater would not result in adverse health effects. The State of New Jersey concurred with EPA’s determination. On June 14, 2002, EPA deleted the site from the NPL.
