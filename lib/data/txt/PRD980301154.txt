Background
The Upjohn Facility site is located in Barceloneta, Puerto Rico. A pharmaceutical manufacturing plant operated at the 2-acre area. A leak in an underground storage tank contaminated wells on site. Soil and groundwater are contaminated with carbon tetrachloride, which is a colorless, nonflammable, vaporous toxic liquid used mainly as a refrigerant, fire extinguisher, cleaning fluid, solvent or insecticide. Metals in the groundwater are believed to have come from nearby industrial activity and from the construction of the stainless steel monitoring wells. The company installed groundwater monitoring wells and covered the area of the site with underground tanks to prevent rainwater from entering the soil. A vacuum extraction well was used to remove contamination from the soil. The population affected by the contamination was provided with alternative water supplies. Under current conditions at the site, potential or actual human exposures are under control. 
The 2-acre site is the former location of a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant. In 1982, about 15,300 gallons of waste material, including carbon tetrachloride, leaked from an underground storage tank on the site. Six wells were sampled for contamination shortly after the leak was detected; four were taken out of service and one on the adjacent A.H. Robins (now Merck) property was commissioned as a recovery well. The population affected by the contaminated wells was given alternative water supplies. The company subsequently installed a replacement well and connected one area to the public water system. Upjohn also installed 22 groundwater monitoring wells. In 1984, the tank farm area of the facility was covered with a fiberglass-reinforced concrete pad to prevent rainwater from seeping into the ground. The company installed an extraction well downgradient of the spill area to intercept the majority of the contaminated groundwater before it left the site. In addition, 19 vacuum extraction wells were employed to withdraw carbon tetrachloride from the soil. More than 12,000 gallons of carbon tetrachloride have been removed from the soil and groundwater. Upjohn ceased all use of carbon tetrachloride by 1986. After immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, and site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1984 Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Immediate Actions: Upjohn installed groundwater monitoring wells and covered the area of the site with underground tanks to prevent rainwater from entering the soil. A vacuum extraction well was used to remove contamination from the soil.Long-term Cleanup: EPA determined that additional measures were needed to ensure that the site does not pose a future threat to human health or the environment. In 1988, EPA selected a remedy to clean up the site by: (1) constructing a new public water supply well to replace the Garrochales #3 well; (2) continuing to pump the groundwater using the existing extraction wells, treating the contaminated water by air stripping, and discharging the treated water into a sinkhole on site; (3) adding more extraction wells if the others prove successful in removing contamination; (4) long-term monitoring; and (5) reevaluating the site within five years to determine whether remedial operations need to be continued or modified.The Garrochales #3 replacement well was drilled in March 1992. The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewerage Authority (PRASA) approved the design of the hook-up into the public water supply in May 1994. The replacement well became operational in December 1995. Upjohn has been pumping, treating and monitoring contaminated groundwater since 1982. Construction of the expanded groundwater pump-and-treat system finished in September 1998.EPA has conducted several five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The reviews concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The remedy will continue to be operated, maintained and monitored until the cleanup standard for carbon tetrachloride in groundwater is attained.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site is being addressed in two stages: immediate actions and a long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site. The groundwater extraction and treatment process, which began as an immediate action, as well as the removal of contaminants from the soil, have greatly reduced the potential for exposure to hazardous substances at the Upjohn site. Groundwater pump and treatment continues to reduce contamination levels, so the site can meet established health/ecological standards. In 1998, EPA concluded that the remedy, as implemented at the site, continues to be protective of human health and the environment. On September 9, 1998, issued a Preliminary Close-Out Report for the site. Up to date fifth Five YEar Review has been conducted at the Site.   ﻿Pump and treatment of the groundwater are currently ongoing.

Sampling and Monitoring
 EPA requires a comprehensive monitoring program for the groundwater extraction and treatment system. Water pressure and flow rates from extraction wells UE-1 and UE-2 are measured on a daily basis. Groundwater samples from extraction wells infuent and effluent of the aeration tower air stripping system, has being collected and analyzed for carbon tetrachloride on a monthly, quarterly and semi-annual basis. Groundwater samples from the influent (AT-IN) of the aeration tower were analyzed for total hardness and alkalinity on a quarterly and semi-annual basis. At the same time, quarterly and semi-annual field measurements of pH, temperature, conductivity and dissolved oxygen performed at sampling points. Daily measurements of total hardness, alkalinity, conductivity and temperature has being recorded at AT-IN. The system is shut down periodically to allow for maintenance and repair. The monitoring data for the groundwater extraction and treatment system are submitted to EPA in semi-annual reports. The carbon tetrachloride data from the extraction wells are presented with historical results and generally show a fair degree of temporal variability, which is expected in karst limestone terrain.
