Background
The North Penn-Area 1 Site is located in Souderton, Pennsylvania. The Site includes three facilities. The first facility, Gentle Cleaners, used tetrachloroethylene (PCE), 1,1,1-trichloroethane and other chlorinated solvents of unknown composition from 1953 to 1983. The second facility, Granite Knitting Mills (GKM), maintained a dry cleaning machine using PCE from 1967 to 1979. The third property, Parkside Apartments, once included a dry cleaning establishment. Historical operations and a documented spill of PCE in the early 1970s contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. The Site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List in March 1989. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In September 1994, EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) selecting the remedy for the Site. The remedy included the removal and off-site disposal of contaminated soil from the three properties of concern and extraction and treatment of groundwater. Groundwater was to be extracted from the Granite Knitting Mills (GKM) well and from the North Penn Water Authority well (S9). A design for implementing this remedy was completed in September 1996. In October 1997, an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) was signed for the purpose of documenting EPA's decision not to pump water from well S9. This decision was based on the low tetrachloroethylene levels detected in this well during the remedial investigation and the remedial design sampling activities, as well as, a change in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's remediation standards. C﻿onstruction of the remedial action, as outlined in the ROD, with the changes included in the October 1997 ESD, was completed in July 1998. In September 1998, a second ESD was issued for the Site to document EPA's decision that the interim action implemented for the remediation of contaminated groundwater should be the final action. This decision was based on the low levels of contamination that were detected in the wells.

What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the Site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by Site decision documents. The most recent, 2023 Five Year Review (PDF), concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Additional monitoring wells and a capture zone analysis are necessary to ensure that the contaminated groundwater remedy is protective in the long term. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2028.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Institutional controls are in placed to restrict groundwater use. Additional information about the institutional controls are available in the 2023 Five Year Review (PDF)  (pages 6-7).

Sampling and Monitoring
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) samples the extraction well and the other four monitoring wells twice per year. Additionally, two surface water samples are collected and analyzed twice per year. PADEP produces a yearly report with the results.
