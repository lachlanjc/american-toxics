Background
The 10th Street Site is located in the south-central part of Columbus, Nebraska, and consists of groundwater plumes and source areas of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) contamination originating from former dry cleaning facilities at three locations. The contaminants threatened the municipal water supply, which supplies drinking water to approximately 20,000 people. The contamination also presents risks from vapor intrusion into residences and businesses.  Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Sampling by the EPA and the state of Nebraska revealed the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the municipal drinking water supply wells. The EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1990. The source of the contamination was traced to three former dry cleaning facilities. Under EPA and state funding, remedial action has included the extraction of contaminated vapors from soil and groundwater, groundwater extraction and treatment, and chemical oxidation injections to treat contaminants in the groundwater plume. Institutional controls prevent soil excavation and consumption of groundwater in contaminated areas to limit possible human exposures. In addition, the EPA has installed vapor mitigation systems at residences and businesses where needed and where access was provided. The EPA also entered into settlements with the owners of the dry cleaning facilities to recover a portion of the response costs. The EPA conducted optimization studies during the course of the remedial actions, and in 2012 issued a Record of Decision (ROD) amendment that eliminated vapor extraction in lieu of acquisition of the buildings over the source areas, excavation of soils at those areas, and limited chemical oxidation or biological treatment of the source areas. Institutional controls and continued operation of the groundwater extraction and treatment system continues. The site is being addressed through federal actions. Sampling of the groundwater in areas surrounding the municipal well fields show TCE and PCE in the groundwater. The water supply is tested by the state and consistently meets the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) limits for public water supplies. In 2015, the EPA acquired four real estate parcels where the source area contamination was located. The EPA demolished the buildings, excavated the contaminated soil and disposed of it in an approved landfill. After sampling to confirm the remaining soil was safe, the area was then backfilled with clean soil, and restored. In 2017, vapor sampling was conducted in nearby houses to confirm that the air was safe for residential use. The federal government has transferred three of the four real estate parcels to the state of Nebraska. Low levels of VOC contamination in groundwater remain at and near the former One Hour Matinizing property near the intersection of Highway 30 and 25th Avenue. The EPA is currently conducting a Focused Feasibility Study to determine the best course of action to address this remaining contamination. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
The EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews evaluate whether the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review in 2020 concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The next Five-Year Review is currently underway and due in 2025.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Institutional controls are in place and updated and recorded in September 2020 for the former source area properties. Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
In 2016, the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy (NDEE), assumed responsiblity for sampling and monitoring at this site. NDEE has perfomed annual groundwater sampling. The EPA is currently conducting a Focused Feasibility Study to determine the best course of action to address remaining contamination at the former One Hour martinizing property near the intersection of Highway 30 and 25th Avenue.
