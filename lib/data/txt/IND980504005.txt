### Background

The 32-acre Waste, Inc. Landfill site is located in Michigan City, Indiana. The site includes the original 16- acre landfill as well as the adjacent Lin-See site; landfilling operations also took place on this property.

Landfill operations contaminated soil, leachate or groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, the site’s long-term remedy is in place. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2008.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. Community engagement during cleanup planning built trust and strong working relationships. For example, a local environmental group designed the fish advisory signs for Trail Creek. EPA was also able to work with many local businesses to resolve potentially disruptive enforcement activities, building community support for the remedy and ensuring its timely implementation.

EPA conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s final remedy included clearing and grubbing activities, waste consolidation, proper abandonment of an on-site water well, removal and disposal of an underground fuel storage tank, fish advisory signs along Trail Creek, slip lining of an active sewer line, and leachate collection. Collected shallow groundwater and leachate is delivered to the Michigan City Sanitary District. Construction of the remedy finished in 1998.

Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2008.

In 2017 the Michigan City Department of Parks and Recreation approached EPA with a proposal to create a walking and biking trail extension that would use the eastern and southern site haul roads. The paved trail was completed in 2021 and is open to the public.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Monthly inspections of the landfill gas collection system indicate that is being properly operated and maintained.

Quarterly inspections of the vegetated cap have confirmed that the cover is adequately maintained.

Annual groundwater monitoring has shown a decreeing trend in groundwater concentrations of VOCs and SVOCs, pesticides and PCBs.
