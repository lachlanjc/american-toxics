Background
 The 38-acre Koppers Coke site is located in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Koppers, Inc. used the site from 1917 to 1979 to produce foundry coke and coking byproducts. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. In 1981, the Saint Paul Port Authority bought the property for reuse. After cleanup of the land, office buildings and light industrial buildings were constructed and are now in use at the site. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing, overseen by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
 The cleanup plan was selected by MPCA and included demolishing buildings, removing storage tanks, digging up and disposing of contaminated soil, monitoring natural improvement of groundwater and restricting groundwater use. Cleanup of the land took place between 1981 and 1998. MPCA continues to monitor natural improvement of groundwater. MPCA conducts periodic reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review, conducted in 2013, concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected and that the remedy as a whole is protective in the short-term, but that  further evaluation of risks from vapor intrusion was needed.  MPCA did that evaluation in 2014 and found that the vapor pathway did not cause risk.

What Is the Current Site Status?
Land has been cleaned up at the site and the property is being reused by commercial and light industrial businesses. Groundwater remains lightly contaminated and MPCA is monitoring natural improvement. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
 Storage and disposal practices along with the dumping of wastes on the land surface, and various leaks and spills resulted in contamination of both soil and groundwater with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-VOCs, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), metals, and cyanide compounds.  Top of Page
