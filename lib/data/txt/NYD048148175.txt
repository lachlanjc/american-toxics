### Background

The Mercury Refining, Inc. site is located on the border of the towns of Guilderland and Colonie, New York. From about 1956 to 1998, Mercury Refining Company, Inc. used an industrial oven to recover mercury from mercury-containing materials, including batteries, thermometers, pressure regulators and dental amalgams. As a result of these activities, mercury and PCB-contaminated soil on site and mercury-contaminated stormwater drained off the site into an unnamed tributary to the Patroon Creek.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, or NYSDEC, sampled the site in 1981 and 1982 and found polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, and mercury contamination in soil on the southern edge of the site property and on the banks of the Patroon Creek tributary. The EPA placed the Mercury Refining site on the National Priorities List in 1983. The NYSDEC oversaw various cleanup actions at the site until the EPA assumed the lead for the cleanup in 1999.

Under an agreement with New York State, Mercury Refining Company, Inc., or MERECO, dug up and removed soil contaminated with mercury and PCBs. MERECO backfilled the excavated area with clean soil and covered it with a clay cap.

The EPA selected a cleanup plan for the site in 2008 that called for removing and treating soil and groundwater contaminated with mercury. The companies responsible for the contamination at the site performed the cleanup under EPA oversight.

During the first phase of the cleanup, contractors removed contaminated surface soil and sediment at the facility and in an unnamed tributary to the Patroon Creek. Workers removed approximately 5,700 tons of mercury-contaminated soil and sediment for disposal off-site.

The second phase of the cleanup targeted the deeper contaminated soil and groundwater. The cleanup plan called for using an in-situ or an in-place solidification/stabilization process. This process involved mixing the soil with Portland cement and a sulfur compound to prevent the mercury contaminated groundwater from migrating off site.

After the cleanup work, contractors filled in all of the excavated (dug up) areas with clean soil and replanted with vegetation. Field staff completed all cleanup actions at the site in 2014.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The cleanup activities at the site have removed contaminated soil and sediment and solidified deeper contaminated soil that could pose a risk to current workers at the site and the environment. The EPA has a long-term monitoring program in place to track the environmental conditions at the site over time. The EPA reviews the results of periodic groundwater and ecological monitoring that includes surface water, sediment and fish tissue sampling. The EPA has found that the work done at the site is protecting people and no further work is needed except continued monitoring.

The EPA deleted the Mercury Refining Inc. site from the National Priorities List in [March 2025](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-05/pdf/2025-03227.pdf). The EPA deletes sites or parts of sites from the NPL when no further cleanup is required to protect people’s health or the environment.

The EPA will conduct follow-up reviews every five years—even after NPL deletion—to ensure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. These reviews, known as Five-Year Reviews, provide an opportunity to evaluate completed cleanups to determine whether they remain protective.

The second five-year review of the site was completed in February 2024. The next five-year review will be completed on or before February 2029.

### Enforcement Information

Between 2005 and 2016, the EPA entered into a total of 13 settlements with 418 potentially responsible parties (PRPs) at the site, which include all of the viable and locatable PRPs. Specifically, the EPA entered into one ability to pay settlement with the owner and operator of the site, seven de minimis settlements with a total of 317 de minimis parties, two settlements in bankruptcy with two de minimis parties, a settlement agreement and order on consent for the performance of the remedial design with seven major parties, a unilateral administrative order for performance of the remedial design with two major parties, and a remedial action judicial consent decree with nine major parties, 19 federal agencies and departments, 42 de minimis parties, and the owner/operator. Through these settlements, the EPA recovered over $6.5 million of the EPA’s response costs and certain future response costs, and secured performance of the work.
