### Background

The 700 South 1600 East PCE Plume site is located near the George E. Wahlen U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center (VAMC) in Salt Lake City, Utah. The VA hospital operated a part-time drycleaning operation that used PCE over a 6-year period in the late 1970s and early 1980s. During this period, dry cleaning residuals were disposed of in the sanitary sewer, which leaked into the surrounding soil and groundwater. PCE-contaminated groundwater is present beneath the VAMC property and in areas hydraulically downgradient.

PCE (tetrachloroethylene) contamination was first detected at a concentration of 32 micrograms per liter (μg/L) in groundwater during routine sampling of the Mount Olivet Cemetery irrigation well in the 1990s. The national drinking water standard for PCE is 5.0 μg/L. The detection led to further investigations of the site. EPA began a site investigation in 1999 that included installation and sampling of six monitoring wells and sampling of the Mount Olivet Cemetery well and Salt Lake City municipal well. Detected concentrations of PCE ranged from 11 to 320 μg/L.

A 2004 site investigation detected PCE in a Salt Lake City municipal drinking water well (well SLC-18) at a concentration of 2.23 (μg/L). As a precautionary measure, Salt Lake City Public Utilities removed the well from service. In July 2005, EPA sent a CERCLA Section 104(e) information request to the VAMC inquiring about their use of PCE. In response, the VA detailed the use of PCE in an on-site closed-loop dry cleaning system. EPA deferred listing the Site on the Superfund Program’s National Priorities List (NPL) while State and local officials sought money from Congress to address the contamination.

In 2010, dissolved PCE was discovered in several residential springs located downgradient from the Site in the lower plume area. An assessment by Salt Lake City Public Utilities (SLCPU) and UDEQ confirmed the presence of PCE in the springs and shallow groundwater in the area. They concluded that the contamination was likely from the same source connected to the PCE detected in the Mount Olivet Cemetery irrigation well. A preliminary assessment/site investigation (PA/SI) completed in 2011 by UDEQ confirmed the presence of PCE in the springs and shallow groundwater, concluded that it potentially impacted the groundwater and that the contamination was connected to the 700 South 1600 East PCE Plume.

Both the city and state supported the proposed listing of the site on the NPL on September 18, 2012, as site conditions and PCE exposure pathways were better defined and mitigation funding efforts did not come to fruition locally. In May 2013, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s NPL and the VA designated as the potentially responsible party for cleanup of the Site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Under CERCLA (Comprehensive Environmental Restoration Compensation and Liability Act, aka “Superfund”) the VA, in coordination with EPA and UDEQ, conducted an accelerated Remedial Investigation (RI), of the areas of the site with the greatest potential for public exposure. The exposure pathway of greatest concern was “vapor intrusion”, which happens when a contaminate that is in groundwater volatilizes into the air in the soil and migrates from the subsurface into an overlying building. This accelerated study was split into two phases. The first phase, completed in 2015, sampled 36 properties for indoor air, outdoor air and near-slab soil gas. Samples were evaluated for PCE as well as other constituents. Of those samples, none were above the regional action level (RAL) of 5.97 ppbv (parts per billion by volume).

The second phase, completed in September 2016, included additional indoor air sampling in identified houses, near-slab soil gas sampling, open-field soil gas sampling, surface water and shallow groundwater sampling. Shallow groundwater sampling was conducted at 44 temporary sampling points, and surface water sampling was conducted at 33 springs and seeps, and 18 storm drain access points. PCE above the MCL was detected in 20 of the seep and spring locations and in six of the storm drain locations. The sample results from one home (0040-H) sampled in 2016 indicated vapor intrusion was occurring at levels above the RAL. The VA determined, with approval of EPA and UDEQ, that a Time Critical Removal Action (TCRA) was needed at this residence. A whole-house air purifying system was installed and tested at 15 days and 30 days post-installation to determine the system was operating successfully. In 2018, at the request of the homeowner, this system was replaced by three portable air filter units. A sub-slab depressurization system was also installed at this location in 2021 to mitigate any vapors that would be entering the home via the basement, but was later removed when it was found the system was not generating sufficient sub slab vapor flow.

The VA began a phased remedial investigation of the groundwater at the Site in 2018, and developed a groundwater flow/contaminant transport model to help understand past and present groundwater flow patterns and their influence on contaminant fate and transport.

In 2019, the VA consolidated its investigation of Site media and potential exposure pathways into a single, sitewide “operable unit”, OU1. The VA completed the OU1 Final Remedial Investigation Report, including a human health and ecological risk assessment, in September, 2022. This report identified the nature and extent of contamination at the site, and provided valuable information about the characteristics of the subsurface that will help select an appropriate remedy.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The VA is planning to complete the Feasibility Study (FS) step of the CERCLA cleanup process in early 2025. This document will identify technologies available to address the specific contamination at the Site, and will evaluate performance of technologies that may be used under site-specific conditions.

The VA has planned several Treatability Studies for 2024 to help inform the development of the Feasibility Study.

After the Feasibility Study is developed by the VA and approved by EPA and UDEQ, the next step is the Proposed Plan. In the Proposed Plan, EPA recommends a preferred remedy and presents the cleanup plan for public comment. Following the public comment period, the EPA issues a final decision document called the Record of Decision (ROD) which identifies the preferred treatment technologies that will be used to cleanup the Site.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Indoor air, soil, soil gas, groundwater, and surface water have been routinely sampled and monitored at the Site. Much of this work has occurred under the Superfund Remedial Investigation (RI) process.

Samples are being analyzed for PCE as well as other constituents because as PCE breaks down chemically, other constituents may form. Other constituents include: trichloroethylene (TCE); cis 1,2 dichloroethene (cis1,2 DCE); trans 1,2 dichloroethene (trans1,2 DCE); 1,1 dichloroethene (1,1 DCE); and vinyl chloride.
