### Background

The three-acre Distler Farm [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located on U.S. Route 60/31 West (Dixie Highway), one mile northeast of West Point in Jefferson County, Kentucky. The site is located on part of a larger 27-acre property, which is an open field. U.S. Route 60/31 West forms the northwest border of the site. The Ohio Valley Raceway racetrack borders the site to the south. Stump Gap Creek runs through the site property. Undeveloped agricultural land is located southwest and northeast of the site. North of U.S. Route 60/31 West is wooded property which borders the Ohio River. Several residences and the Ohio River are located northwest of the site, across U.S. Route 60/31 West. The Distler Brickyard Superfund site is located two miles south of this site.

During the 1970s, Kentucky Liquid Recycling, Inc. stored and disposed of industrial chemical wastes on the site.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983 because of contaminated groundwater and soil resulting from waste handling practices.

The EPA and the [Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection (KDEP)](http://dep.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site. By treating and monitoring groundwater and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, the EPA and KDEP continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

The remedy at the site currently protects human health and the environment because there are currently no completed exposure pathways.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The EPA led site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with KDEP. In 2002, KDEP took over cleanup activities as well as operation and maintenance activities at the site.

**1986**  
The site’s long-term remedy included:

- digging up and removing contaminated soil
- disposing of contaminated soil at an off-site landfill
- backfilling dug-up areas with clean soil
- grading and revegetating the backfilled areas
- extracting and storing contaminated groundwater on site for treatment
- treating contaminated groundwater on site and discharging treated water to the local water treatment facility
- injecting uncontaminated water into the groundwater aquifer
- operation and maintenance activities.

**1989**  
In 1989, the EPA installed a groundwater treatment system at the site, including extraction wells, pipes and a temporary storage tank.

EPA was responsible for groundwater treatment between 1991 and 2001.

**1997**  
During an inspection in 1977, the EPA found 600 drums of waste on the site.

**1998**  
Following Ohio River flooding in 1978, the EPA found more than 800 additional drums on the site. The Agency also found several waste burial locations. EPA and KDEP removed 120 drums and more than 2,600 small containers of hazardous wastes, disposing of them at an off-site facility.

EPA found additional drums while constructing a site access road. The drums contained medical and laboratory waste, herbicides, solvents, solids and lab pack materials. EPA removed 25 drums as well as about 150 square feet of contaminated soil to a depth of 15-feet.

EPA found additional drums containing hospital wastes and removed the drums and surrounding contaminated soil. EPA also conducted final cleanup activities, which included digging up 300 tons of soil, incinerating the soil at an off-site facility, backfilling the dug-up areas with clean soil and seeding the backfilled areas with grass.

EPA updated the long-term remedy in 1988, requiring cleanup of soil and groundwater to health-based criteria levels.

**2002**  
In 2002, KDEP assumed responsibility for site cleanup activities, including the treatment of groundwater. The groundwater pump and treat system was removed in 2003.

**2023/2024**  
EPA conducted five rounds of groundwater sampling to assess groundwater status. to be detected above the maximum contaminant limit. Arsenic and lead above their respective maximum contaminant levels were detected.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The [most recent Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11189175.pdf) was published in July 2023. The remedy at the site currently protects human health and the environment because there are currently no completed exposure pathways.The Five-Year Review recommends continued groundwater sampling, conducting soil sampling, and evaluating the need for institutional controls.

EPA conducted five groundwater sampling events in 2023 and 2024 to assess the groundwater. Arsenic bove their respective maximum contaminant levels. Soil sampling to evaluate the need for land-based institutional controls is planned in mid-2025. Soil sampling to evaluate the need for land-based institutional controls is planned in mid-2025.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Sampling results from 2015 and 2018 indicate that groundwater remediation may be complete, but additional data is needed. EPA is working with KDEP to gather data.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of the Agency’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, the EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) to fund site activities conducted by EPA and KDEP.
