### Background

The 2.3-acre Arlington Blending & Packaging [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located on U.S. Highway 70 in Arlington, Tennessee, approximately 25 miles northeast of Memphis. U.S. Highway 70 borders the site to the north. A CSX rail line borders the site to the south. The Mary Alice neighborhood borders the site to the east. A Tennessee Department of Transportation maintenance facility borders the site to the west. The site’s broader surroundings include single-family residential areas and commercial and agricultural land uses. The Loosahatchie River is located 3,000 feet north of the site. People use the river for swimming and fishing.

From 1971 to 1978, the Arlington Blending & Packaging Company operated a pesticide formulation and packaging facility at the site. Spills, leaks, and disposal practices from site operations resulted in the contamination of soil and groundwater. Contaminants include base neutral acids, metals, persistent organic pollutants, pesticides and volatile organic compounds.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1987 because of contaminated groundwater and soil resulting from facility operations. The EPA, the [Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC),](https://www.tn.gov/environment/about‐tdec‐home.html) and the site’s [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. A water line connects residences and businesses to the public water supply. By monitoring groundwater, implementing institutional controls and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, TDEC and the site’s PRPs continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s PRPs lead site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and TDEC.

**1983**  
EPA conducted short-term cleanup activities by excavating 1,920 cubic yards of contaminated soil from depths ranging from six inches to four feet across the site property. The action also removed 112 drums of stored chemical wastes.

**1987**  
EPA listed the site on the NPL.

**1990**  
EPA removed about 70 cubic yards of contaminated soil from a residential property east of the site property.

**1991**  
In June, EPA issued a clean-up plan (Record of Decision, or ROD). The selected remedy included:

- excavation of an estimated 24,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil;
- decontamination of contaminated soil using thermal desorption;
- placement of treated soil into the excavated areas;
- activated carbon treatment of contaminated groundwater with discharge of the treated water to the Loosahatchie River or the nearby publicly owned treatment works; and
- on-site solidification of soils containing levels of metals above cleanup levels for off-site disposal.

**1993**  
All site buildings except one were demolished and removed.

**1994**  
EPA modified with cleanup plan with an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD). The significant changes included:

- a one-foot clean soil cover of the backfilled LTTD-treated soils;
- arsenic monitoring in groundwater;
- limited excavation of subsurface soils near the railroad lines and buried telecommunications cable;
- limited excavation depth to the site’s shallow water table (approximate 15 feet below ground surface; and
- clarified and updated treatment standards and methods.

**1996**  
The PRPs excavated, stockpiled, treated and backfilled over 41,000 tons of contaminated soil. The soil was treated using on-site low temperature thermal desorption (LTTD). Over 200 tons of arsenic-contaminated soil was transported to an off-site landfill.

**1997**  
In July, EPA changed the cleanup plan for groundwater through a ROD Amendment. This changed from a pump and treat remedy to monitored natural attenuation.

**1998**  
EPA approved a Long-Term Monitoring and Maintenance Plan that included annual sampling of monitoring wells, semi-annual sampling of surface water sampling locations in the Loosahatchie River, and annual reports submitted to the Agency.

**2011**  
EPA approved an addendum to the Long-Term Monitoring and Maintenance (LTMM) Plan to include two additional monitoring well locations and one additional surface water monitoring location.

**2017**  
In May, EPA approved changes to the LTMM Plan. The changes included discontinuing sampling in some locations and decreasing sampling frequency.

In September, EPA completed the site’s fourth Five-Year Review and found that the remedy is currently protective of human health and the environment. It provided the following recommendations for the remedy to be protective in the long-term:

- document changes to the remedy to include government controls as the groundwater institutional controls in a decision document;
- evaluate current soil conditions on the railroad property;
- evaluate current groundwater conditions on adjacent properties.

**2021**

The recommendations made in the 2017 FYR were completed in 2021..

**2022**

In September, EPA completed the site’s fifth Five-Year Review and found that the remedy is currently protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11173864.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2022. The remedy at Arlington Blending and Packaging protects human health and the environment under its current land use which is recreational in the short term.

In 1991, EPA issued a long-term cleanup plan for the site. The plan included digging up and treating contaminated soil using low-level heat to remove chemicals from soil, and using a pump-and-treat system to address groundwater contamination.

The site’s PRPs continue to monitor site groundwater annually to assess the performance of monitored natural attenuation selected remedy. The PRPs also continue to conduct operation and maintenance activities.

The site has been redeveloped into Mary Alice Park. The park includes a playground, field space, walking and biking trails, and exercise stations. It also includes a half-court basketball court and signs that explain the history of the park and celebrate its successful redevelopment.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The Shelby County Ordinance states a water well cannot be sited or placed in service within a half-mile of the designated boundaries of a listed federal or state Superfund Site or Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) corrective action site.

The remedy at Arlington Blending and Packaging protects human health and the environment under its current land use which is recreational in the short term.
