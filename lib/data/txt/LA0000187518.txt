### Background

**Current Status**

Site was delisted from the National Priorities List (NPL) on September 19, 2005, and is available for reuse. No hazardous substances remain at the Site above levels that prevent unlimited use and unrestricted exposure.

**Site Background**

The 10-acre Mallard Bay Landing Bulk Plant site is located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. Mallard Resources, Inc. (MRI) operated a hazardous waste treatment/storage/disposal facility and a hazardous waste generator of petroleum refining industry-listed wastes on site. The facility closed in 1987. Contaminants of concern included volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and metals. Following completion of the remedy at the site, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2005.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.

MRI operated a hazardous waste treatment/storage/disposal facility and a hazardous waste generator of petroleum refining industry-listed wastes on site. From 1983 to 1987, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ), formerly the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (LDNR), completed several site inspections. In 1983, an inspection reported that the facility was not in operation and that there were no indications that MRI was correcting previous violations. As a result, LDNR issued a Letter of Warning to MRI, which filed for bankruptcy and sold the facility to Cameron Resources, Inc., (CRI).  
  
In January 1984, a general inspection by LDEQ found that CRI was completely renovating the facility to bring it up to operating status. In March 1985, the facility’s status changed to a hazardous waste generator. CRI began operations in August 1985. In 1985, LDEQ issued a Compliance Order to CRI that the facility complied with by the end of March 1986. In 1987, LDEQ performed a general inspection based on information that CRI had filed for bankruptcy and that the facility had closed.MRI operated a hazardous waste treatment/storage/disposal facility and a hazardous waste generator of petroleum refining industry-listed wastes on site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included extraction, in-place stabilization and off-site disposal of contaminated sludge and soil; dismantling, demolition and off-site disposal of underground piping and aboveground building structures; removal and off-site disposal of waste materials in stockpiles and drums; and groundwater monitoring. EPA later updated the remedy to change the treatment approach for contaminated sludges. Remedial activities began in 2000 and finished in 2003.  
  
Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2005.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions from 1998 to 1999 included sampling, operating heavy equipment, cleaning tanks, decontaminating equipment, conducting air monitoring, treating and discharging surface water, and arranging for off-site disposal of tank materials. Materials disposed of off site included two Portafeed units, 24 laboratory packs, two overpacked drums, 142 55-gallon metal drums, 824,300 gallons of tank material by barge and 26,000 gallons of tank material by truck.
