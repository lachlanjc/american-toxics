### Background

The 40-acre Publicker Industries Inc. site is located in Philadelphia, along the Delaware River near the Walt Whitman Bridge. Publicker Industries produced liquor and industrial alcohols from 1912 to 1985. A petroleum product and chemical storage facility also operated at the site during the late 1970s and 1980s. The site included large tanks, storage drums, product stock, chemical laboratories, production buildings, warehouses, a power plant and several hundred miles of aboveground and underground process lines. Historical operations at the site contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1989. Following cleanup, the site was removed from the NPL in 2000.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site included large tanks, storage drums, product stock, chemical laboratories, production buildings, warehouses, a power plant, and several hundred miles of aboveground and underground process lines. Solid and liquid gas streams, highly-reactive lab wastes, and gas cylinders combined to create an extreme threat of fire and explosion. Pipes were insulated with asbestos and electrical equipment contained PCBs. Vessels and transfer lines containing hazardous materials were in disrepair and subject to vandalism. In 1987, the portion of the facility using carbon dioxide was destroyed in a multi-alarm fire. Routine air monitoring revealed volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in 1988. Shallow on-site groundwater was slightly contaminated with toluene. The deep groundwater aquifer contained minimal levels of VOCs such as toluene and xylene. VOCs and heavy metal contamination had been detected in on-site soils.

From 1987 to 1988, EPA took the following emergency removal actions: bulked, stored, transported and disposed of waste in order to address fire and explosion threats. After addressing emergency conditions, EPA issued a [Record of Decision (ROD) (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/130339) that further stabilized site conditions using the following cleanup methods: transported bulked waste streams off-site for disposal; demolished aboveground process lines after recovering their contents; transported these recovered line-contents off-site for disposal; and properly packed and stored the asbestos-laden pipe insulation. These cleanup actions began in 1989 and were completed in 1990.

The [second ROD (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/381325), issued in June 1991, selected a remedy to remove the bagged asbestos. A fire in early 1992 delayed the cleanup work. The asbestos abatement work was eventually completed in May 1995.

An investigation of the source and extent of groundwater and soil contamination was completed and a [third ROD (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/130476) was signed in December 1995. The major components of the ROD were: sealed and abandoned on-site groundwater wells; removed the liquids and sediments in contaminated electric utilities for treatment and off-site disposal; removed the liquids and sediments in contaminated storm water trenches and utilities for treatment and off-site disposal; and removed miscellaneous wastes for treatment and off-site disposal. The ROD additionally had a provision that future excavation work will be monitored. This cleanup work was finished in December 1997 and was marked the 500th completed Superfund site in the nation.

In February 2000, EPA performed a five-year review of the site and confirmed that it was successfully cleaned up and safe for industrial use. After the cleanup was complete, EPA issued a final close-out report (FCOR) in March 2000. EPA proposed to remove the site from the National Priorities List (NPL) on July 20, 2000, and after receiving no comments, it was removed from the NPL on November 1, 2000.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by Site decision documents. The most recent, [2019 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2292901), concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment and that it is safe for industrial use. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2024.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls are in placed to require notice of any construction or excavation activities. Additional information about the institutional controls are available in the [2019 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2292901) (pages 7-8).

### Enforcement Information

Concurrent with the investigation and cleanup of the Site, there were a series of legal actions taken by EPA in order to clean-up the site and recover costs the federal government spent. On July 7, 1987, EPA and Bruga Corporation signed a legal document, known as a Consent Order, formalizing Bruga's cleanup responsibilities for this Site. Under the Order, Bruga dismantled and decontaminated personal property in two portions of the Site it had purchased from the bankrupt estate. On December 8, 1988, EPA and AAA Warehousing Inc. entered into a separate Consent Order. Under this Order, AAA removed some stainless steel tanks and rail tank cars it owned. On December 19, 1990, EPA filed a cost recovery action against Publicker Industries and Cuyahoga Wrecking/Overland Corporation to recover government funds spent on the sSite. Cuyahoga Wrecking/Overland Corporation filed for bankruptcy. The cost recovery case with Publicker Industries was settled on December 28, 1995. In this agreement, Publicker Industries agreed to pay the United States $13.35 million plus interest and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection $1 million plus interest.
