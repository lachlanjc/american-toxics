Background
The Allegany Ballistics Laboratory (ABL) is located in Mineral County in the northeastern part of West Virginia, approximately 10 miles southwest of Cumberland, Maryland along the West Virginia and Maryland border.  ABL was constructed in 1942 for the Army and used as a loading plant for machine gun ammunition. The Navy took ownership of the facility in 1945. Since 1943, ABL has been used primarily for the research, development, production, and testing of solid propellants and motors for ammunition, rockets, and armaments. Currently, the facility is operated as a highly automated production facility for tactical propulsion systems and composite and metal structures. ABL consists of about 1,627 acres of land and is divided into three distinct operating plants. Plant 1 occupies approximately 1,471 acres and is owned by the Navy and leased to a private defense company, herein referred to as the ABL onsite operator, by NAVSEA through a Facilities Lease Agreement (FLA). Approximately 400 acres of Plant 1 (the majority of the developed portion of ABL) is located within the floodplain of the North Branch Potomac River. Plant 2 occupies 65 acres and is owned and operated by the onsite operator. Plant 2 is not included on the National Priorities List (NPL). Plant 3 occupies approximately 91 acres and is owned by the Navy and leased to the onsite operator by NAVSEA through the (FLA). Plant 3 is not in the floodplain of the North Branch Potomac River. It is situated at the base of Knobley Mountain. Past and present activity resulted in contamination of the soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment with Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), Chlorinated Volatile Organic Compounds (CVOCs), Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Metals and municipal and construction waste materials as well as explosives related contaminants. The Plant 1 portion of the ABL Site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in May 1994.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
This site is being addressed through federal actions. In January of 1998 a Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) between EPA, the Department of the Navy and the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) identified areas for investigation and possible cleanup. The FFA provided the framework and a schedule to accomplish this work. Currently, there are 7 Sites being addressed under the Superfund with additional areas being investigated for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) contamination. EPA has signed Records of Decision (RODs) selecting remedies for 12 operable units A full list of operable units with a description of the remedy can be viewed under the Operable Units section.

What Is the Current Site Status?
There is currently one site under investigation which may require a remedy at the site. OU-15 (Site 13 Range Road Area formerly SWMU 27a).  The Navy has the lead role for cleaning up the Allegany Ballistics Laboratory. Per the Federal Facilities Agreement between EPA, the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) and the Navy, a Site Management Plan (SMP) is annually updated with activities at each operable unit and area of concern. For detailed information on the current cleanup status, see ABL Environmental Restoration Program Public Website. A full list of activities per each operable unit can be found under the Cleanup Progress section. The lead agency conducts five-year reviews for remedies implemented. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents.  The 2023 Five Year Review can be found in Navy’s Administrative Record. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2028.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Active Land Use controls are in place for multiple sites.  See the Five Year Review found in Navy’s Administrative Record for a discussion of Land Use Controls. Additionally, Land Use Control quarterly reports are also located in the Administrative Record. EPA has Co-signed Records of Decision (RODs) at the Allegany Ballistics Laboratory, selecting remedies for twelve Operable Units (OUs). Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
​The pump and treat system at Site 1 and Site 10, and the landfill cap and permeable reactive barrier at Site 5 have greatly reduced exposure to contaminants from the facility. Additionally, several water supply wells on the facility had been shut down to reduce potential exposure to contaminated groundwater. Top of Page
