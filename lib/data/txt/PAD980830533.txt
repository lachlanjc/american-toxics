### Background

The 25-acre Eastern Diversified Metals site is located in Rush Township, Pennsylvania. Eastern Diversified Metals operated a copper and aluminum reclamation facility on site from 1966 to 1977. Site activities included the disposal of waste materials from copper and aluminum electrical wires in a large pile on the property. The company used an on-site water treatment plant to collect and treat shallow groundwater. Occasional overflows resulted in runoff into the Little Schuylkill River. Following a fire at the facility in 1979, investigations determined that site activities contaminated soil, sediment, surface water and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. The site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List on October 4, 1989.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s long-term remedy included removing contaminated sediments, soil and debris; incinerating some waste; runoff collection and treatment; capping of contaminated soils; and enhanced shallow groundwater collection. Construction of the remedy took place between 1994 and 2008.

In 1994, pursuant to a Consent Order, the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP) installed a leachate collection and secondary treatment system in the southwest corner of the facility to monitor, treat and collect leachate/shallow groundwater coming from the site..

Operation and maintenance (O&M) activities are ongoing. The O&M plan specifically calls for quarterly inspections, and repairs and maintenance as needed. Additionally, there is long-term O&M of the treatment plant. A plant operator is on site two to three days a week to ensure proper operation of the treatment system. Contractors also perform routine monitoring of the treatment system and collect the plant discharge in accordance with the approved standard operating procedure for the plant. Samples are also collected several times a month for performance monitoring.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed through state, federal and potentially responsible party actions.

Because waste remains in place at the Site, EPA conducts Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent [2018 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2252526) concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2023.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls are in place to prevent access and damage to the cap and associated structures. Additional information about the institutional controls are available in the [2018 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2252526) (page 8).

### Emergency Response and Removal

The cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions in 1987 and 1994 included installation of a security fence around the site; upgrade and operation of the on-site groundwater treatment plant; removal of contaminated sediments; replacement of an installation basin; incineration of dioxin-contaminated materials; and construction of a subsurface leachate collection trench.
