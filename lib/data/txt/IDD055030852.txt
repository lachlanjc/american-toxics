### Background

The 1-acre Union Pacific Railroad Co. (UPRR) site is located in Pocatello, Idaho. The site is also known as the UPRR Sludge Pit site. From 1961 until 1983, UPRR dumped sludge from its wastewater treatment plant into a 1-acre unlined sludge pit. Site operations contaminated soil and groundwater with heavy metals and organic compounds. Contamination has been addressed and Amtrak currently operates a train station on site. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1997.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

From 1961 until 1983, UPRR dumped yards of sludge from its wastewater treatment plant into a 1-acre unlined sludge pit. In 1983, EPA found that seepage from the UPRR’s sludge pit and from a nearby railroad tie treating facility contributed to the contamination of the underlying aquifers. UPRR performed cleanup activities under a legal agreement with EPA. UPRR completed the cleanup actions in 1994.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA selected the site’s long-term remedy in 1991. It included excavating and disposing of contaminated sludge, silt and soil off site; removing non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL); covering the pit boundary following excavation, backfilling and grading; flushing residual contamination from the soil; fencing the pit; institutional controls; and groundwater monitoring.

**Cleanup Progress**

Remedy construction finished in 1994. It consisted of the excavation and off-site disposal sludge/soil into a permitted landfill, and pre-treatment of contaminated groundwater before discharge to the city’s water treatment plant.

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1997. Groundwater monitoring confirmed that groundwater beneath the site now meets federal drinking water standards.
