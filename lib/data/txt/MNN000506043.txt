### Background

The site consists of a vapor plume contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), primarily trichloroethylene (TCE), from several known and unknown sources. The site was identified based on sampling conducted at the General Mills/Henkel Corp. (GMH) NPL site, which is located immediately downgradient. A groundwater and vapor plume from the Southeast Hennepin Area Groundwater and Vapor site was found to be migrating toward the GMH site. The surrounding area has been developed into commercial and industrial operations since the 1930s. Former and current operations include foundry/outdoor motor manufacturing, metal finishing and dry-cleaning operations that may have used VOCs. A gravel pit also operated in the northern portion of the site where suspected disposal occurred until approximately 1977. Residential properties are located along the southern portion of the site and the area south of Hennepin Avenue is predominantly residential homes.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Environmental investigations have identified a large VOC vapor and groundwater plume in an area which includes commercial properties, and nearby residential properties. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) has managed site contamination for several years under a variety of state programs, both voluntary and enforcement driven, but has been unable to effectuate a comprehensive investigation and clean-up.
