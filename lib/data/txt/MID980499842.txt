### Background

The 100-acre Rose Township Dump site is located in Rose Township, Michigan. Illegal waste disposal began on site in the 1960s. Operators placed an estimated 5,000 drums of waste on, and into, 12 acres of the southwest part of the site. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions. Because of Chrysler Corporation's bankruptcy proceedings, EPA used site-specific special account funding to restart the groundwater treatment system and make sure the site’s remedy was put in place.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires compliance with effective institutional controls and long-term operation and monitoring of the groundwater treatment system.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included treatment of contaminated soils, an interim groundwater pump-and-treat system, long-term groundwater extraction and treatment, and replacement of two residential wells. Construction of the remedy took place between 1992 and 2009. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The wastes disposed of at the site include PCBs, lead paint sludges, and VOCs such as toluene, benzene, and trichloroethene. VOCs, lead, and PCBs leaked from the drums and contaminated the surface soils (lead, PCBs), subsurface soils (VOCs), and groundwater (VOCs) at the site. The groundwater also contains vinyl chloride, a breakdown product of trichloroethene.

### Sampling and Monitoring

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions in 1980, 1985 and 1986 disposed of over 5,000 abandoned drums.
