Background
The 190-acre Operating Industries, Inc., Landfill site is located in Monterey Park, California. Landfilling operations at the site took place from 1948 to 1984. Landfill activities at the site contaminated air, groundwater, soil and leachate with various organic and inorganic compounds. Following construction of the remedy, operation and monitoring activities and maintenance are ongoing.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires a technical evaluation of the monitored natural attenuation remedy, implementation of restrictive covenants, and recording of the access and restrictive easements.

What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA addressed site cleanup in five stages: emergency actions and four long-term remedial phases focused on cleanup of the entire site, including leachate management, installation of a gas control and landfill cover, and site controls and monitoring.Remedy SelectedLeachate Management: The long-term remedy included control of landfill liquids around the perimeter of the site, natural attenuation and monitoring of contaminated groundwater, and operation and maintenance of the leachate treatment plant, gas extraction and air dike, irrigation, and other cleanup technologies. Natural attenuation describes a variety of in-place processes that, under favorable conditions, act without human intervention to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume or concentration of contaminants in groundwater.Gas Control and Landfill Cover: The long-term remedy included gas extraction wells to collect landfill gases, landfill gas destruction and monitoring. EPA later updated the remedy to include a landfill cover, perimeter landfill gas extraction wells, monitoring wells and upgraded landfill gas technologies.Site Controls and Monitoring: The interim remedy included full-time site controls and monitoring with preventative maintenance and operation of the gas collection/control and leachate systems.Cleanup OngoingGas Control and Landfill Cover: Cleanup activities at the South Parcel included new gas extraction wells, new gas piping, additional gas destruction capacity and monitoring facilities. A landfill cover system prevents movement of gas through the surface of the site and decreases odors, dust and landfill gas emissions. The cap reduces infiltration of water and oxygen into the landfill and prevents erosion and movement of landfill materials. The surface water management system minimizes the potential for runoff of landfill contaminants during rainfall and erosion of the cover. Construction of these remedies finished in 2000. Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.Cleanup activities at the north parcel included installation of a final cover and passive landfill gas controls system. Cleanup activities finished in 2009. Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.The groundwater remedy finished in 2012 with the construction and performance testing of the perimeter liquids control system.Leachate Management: Construction of an on-site leachate treatment plant began in 1991. The plant is now operational. Installation of a final cover and passive landfill gas control system finished in 2009.Site Controls and Monitoring: Operation of the gas control systems and landfill gas treatment facility and maintenance of treatment technologies are ongoing. Installation of new gas recovery wells and monitoring probes has increased the amount of gas collected. Site control and monitoring activities have been ongoing since 1997.

Emergency Response and Removal
In the late 1980s, EPA fenced the site and posted a guard to keep trespassers from coming into contact with hazardous substances. EPA conducted a number of emergency actions, including rehabilitation of the former main gas flare station, slope stability and erosion control improvements, surface runoff and drainage improvements, and off-site trucking and treatment of leachate collected at the site.
