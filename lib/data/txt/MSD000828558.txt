### Background

The Southeastern Wood Preserving Superfund site is located in Canton, Mississippi. Several wood-treating companies conducted wood-treating operations from 1928 and 1979. The companies used coal tar, creosote and pentachlorophenol as wood preservatives. Operators constructed three unlined wastewater holding ponds for disposal of wood preserving treatment sludges and process wastewater. Before 1977, the facility reportedly discharged 50,000 gallons of wastewater directly into Batchelor Creek.

EPA listed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in March 2012 because of soil, surface water and sediment resulting from facility operations. EPA and the [Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ)](https://www.mdeq.ms.gov/) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination.

Residents and businesses near the site use the public water supply, which is safe to drink.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**1985**  
As a result of MDEQ findings, the EPA initiated a time critical removal action in 1985 to stabilize three unlined surface impoundments. Approximately 10,500 cubic yards (cy) of sludge and soil were excavated, stabilized with lime kiln dust and stockpiled on the central portion of the SEWP facility to await treatment or disposal. The excavated material was classified by EPA as a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) K001 listed hazardous waste

**1989**  
In 1989, EPA performed a creek widening / deepening of Batchelor Creek to assist an effort by Soil Conservation Services to better stabilize the creek banks. Contaminated soil was excavated to form a 20-foot (ft) wide bottom with 2:1 side slopes and a geotextile fabric liner and riprap were put into place. Soil generated by the creek widening was added to the on-site waste stockpile mentioned above.

**1990 – 1994**  
From 1990-1994 during a removal action, the EPA conducted on-site treatment of the waste pond stockpile in order to meet RCRA land disposal restriction (LDRs) treatment standards for K001 so that it could be disposed of in accordance with RCRA regulations. Treatment of K001 contaminated soil was not entirely successful and a Treatability Variance for certain RCRA hazardous constituents was approved by the EPA Regional Administrator in 1992. The treated waste was placed on the central parcel in a lined containment cell, clay cap, soil cover and fenced. This cell is still present on the former facility awaiting incorporation into the final site remedy.

**2007 - 2008**  
During a removal action, the EPA concluded that creosote DNAPL had the potential to flow into Batchelor Creek. In 2008, EPA conducted an Expanded Site Investigation (ESI) and discovered elevated concentrations of SVOCs in site soil and creek sediments.

**2009**  
EPA excavated approximately 1,100 linear ft of soil and sediment to a depth of 20-ft below land surface (bls) from Batchelor Creek. The creek was backfilled and lined with a geotextile liner and riprap. Tow to three ft of clay and clean topsoil were placed and graded over much of the Site. Approximately 45,800 cy of excavated soil/sediment was transported and disposed of at a local landfill.

EPA began a short-term cleanup action to address immediate threats at the site. These removal activities included digging up, stabilizing and stockpiling 8,000 cubic yards of contaminated sludge in the wastewater holding ponds; constructing a containment cell to contain the soil; digging up contaminated sediment from Batchelor Creek next to the site and constructing a second cell for this material; and constructing a specialized wall to prevent creosote from flowing into Batchelor Creek. EPA completed these actions on March 15, 2011.

**2010**  
EPA installed a 1,500 ft long subsurface barrier wall to 30-ft deep along the southern bank of Batchelor Creek to prevent further migration of DNAPL into the creek.

**2012**  
The EPA began the RI in 2012. EPA also conducted a time-critical removal action of surface soil from 0-2 ft bls at 19 residential and commercial properties based on soil results obtained during the ESI and RI. An estimated 1,700 cy of soil were stockpiled on the western portion of the former facility to be incorporated in the final site remedial action. The removal action was completed in June 2014.

**2013 – 2014**  
During the first three sampling events of the RI/FS, contamination was identified off site and in the residential community. Contaminated soils at properties with levels of contaminants that exceeded the RMLs were removed between October 2013 and April 2014. A total of 12 residential and seven commercial properties were included in this removal action, or short-term cleanup. The removal action has been completed and the residents involved have been notified of the action completion.

**2016**  
EPA issued a Proposed Plan for public comment on June 2, 2016. A public meeting was held on June 16, 2016 to present the Proposed Plan and to address comments and concerns from residents.

- The [Record of Decision was signed September 27, 2016](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11050370). The ROD-selected remedy includes:
	- a longer and deeper barrier wall to be constructed surrounding a 7.9-acre portion of the site;
	- shallow contaminated soil from areas located outside of the barrier wall would be excavated and placed within the barrier wall;
	- the barrier wall area will be covered with a composite low permeability cap and cover;
	- stormwater controls and long‐term maintenance of the containment area and cap will be required; and,
	- the treated stockpile will be transported off‐site, treated (if required) and disposed of at an approved landfill.

The total cost of the selected remedy is $30 million.

**2018**

The Basis of Design report was issued. This report provides the plans, specifications, design criteria, provisions, and requirements necessary to implement the remedy.

**2022**

The site received funding and Remedial Action (RA) activities were initiated in October 2022. Completion of the RA is anticipated by summer 2025.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The Remedial Action (RA) is currently underway. Below is a summary of completed RA activities as of December 2024:

Slurry Wall Install – The slurry wall installation is complete and extends from the surface to approx. 5-ft into the Yazoo clay. On average, depth varies from approx. 40 ft to 25 ft bgs. Quality control sampling was conducted at two depth intervals every 50 ft. The target UCS was 25 psi and the average UCS for all samples was 36.9 psi. The target hydraulic conductivity was 5.0 x 10-7 cm/sec and the average for all samples was 2.16 x 10-7 cm/sec.

Offsite Soil Disposal – Approx 7,278 tons of soil was taken to a subtitle C landfill for offsite disposal and an additional 8,194 tons of soil was incinerated.

Cross Creek Excavation – During excavation of the central cross creek excavation area, EPA identified contamination deeper than anticipated (down to 21 ft below ground surface) and a few stringers on the side walls. This resulted in removal of nearly 50 percent more soil than anticipated from the central portion. Cross creek excavation on the central and western portions of Batchelor creek have been completed and backfilled.

Surface Soil Excavation (0-2ft) – The majority of the shallow contaminated soil from areas located outside of the barrier wall have been excavated and placed within the barrier wall. The remaining areas include the vicinity of the former scale house and silo as well as paved area on the south central portion of the site.

Landfill Cap – Third party testing of the landfill cap confirmed specifications have been met. The material has been delivered to the site and install is anticipated in early 2025.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA has been unable to identify any viable potentially responsible parties for the site. The EPA anticipates using federal funds to conduct additional site cleanup.
