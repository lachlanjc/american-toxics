Background
The UGI Columbia Gas Plant is a 1.5-acre site located in a light industrial/residential area 400 feet northeast of the Susquehanna River in southern Pennsylvania. From 1851 to 1949, Columbia Gas used the site for gas manufacturing. In 1932, ownership of the property was transferred to Pennsylvania Power and Light (PP&L) and subsequently transferred to Lancaster County Gas Company in 1949. Lancaster County Gas merged with UGI Corporation which owned the site until 1979. The property was used as a boat dealership from 1979 until 1994 when it was repurchased by PP&L. During the years of active gas manufacturing operations at the site, overflows from an on-site tar separator were directed to an open ditch that led to the Susquehanna River. Records show that local fishermen complained to the gas plant that their boats were being covered with tar. The site was added to EPA's National Priorities List in May 1994. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. The PRPs, Pennsylvania Power and Light (PP&L) and UGI Utilities (UGI) entered into agreements with the United States and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for performance of removal activities at the site as well as remedial work. During 2006 and 2007, several removal activities took place at the site, including the excavation and proper disposal of contaminated soils, the installation of concrete and asphalt caps at the former gas plant property, and the installation of four additional monitoring wells for the dissolved phase groundwater. In September of 2007, EPA selected the final cleanup plan for the site in a Record of Decision (ROD) (PDF). The ROD outlined the following remedies: 
For site soils, no additional cleanup is needed;
Long-term groundwater monitoring;
Operation and maintenance of asphalt caps that were installed during removal activities;
Institutional controls; and
A waiver for restoration of dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) groundwater. DNAPL is denser than water and does not dissolve in water. 
A groundwater monitoring plan was approved for the site in June 2011, which includes sampling on an annual basis. EPA evaluated data from groundwater sampling, assessed an alternate remedial strategy, and evaluated the existing boundaries of the DNAPL zones to make sure they are appropriate for the waiver. The PRPs performed additional geophysical tests and submitted a Focused Feasibility Study that was approved by EPA in May 2016. In June 2018, EPA completed an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) (PDF) for the site. This ESD expands the area where groundwater will not be restored (referred to as the “technical impracticability waiver zone”); eliminates cleanup levels for contaminants of concern that have no applicable federal drinking water standards; and modifies the list of remaining contaminants of concern. Columbia Borough purchased the former gas plant property and is reusing the property for the Borough's vehicle maintenance garage and road salt storage facility. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA has conducted the second five-year review of the site’s remedy. This review ensures that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The 2021 Five-Year Review (PDF) concluded that the remedy is protective of human health and the environment because the concrete and asphalt caps prevent unacceptable exposure to remaining contaminated soil and no exposure to contaminated groundwater is currently occurring. However, the review recommended additional evaluation of institutional controls for properties affected by site contamination, further evaluation of groundwater data and monitoring of site-related contaminants to determine if an ecological risk is present. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2026.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Institutional controls are in place to restrict groundwater use, prohibit excavation or removal of soils and prohibit residential use. Additional information about the institutional controls are available in the 2021 Five-Year Review (PDF)(pages 10-18). Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
Groundwater monitoring wells are located throughout the site to check contaminant levels.

Emergency Response and Removal
On November 2, 2006 EPA signed an Action Memorandum approving a removal response action for the excavation and proper disposal of contaminated soils, the installation of concrete and asphalt caps at the two-acre former gas plant property, and the installation of four additional monitoring wells for the dissolved phase groundwater. The subsurface soils at the site are contaminated with polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals, and the site groundwater contains a dense non-aqueous phase liquid contaminated with coal tar and PAHs.The dissolved phase groundwater is contaminated with benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX), PAHs and cyanide and is a source of contamination for the pre-treated municipal water supply. On November 29, 2006, EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with potentially responsible parties (PRPs), Pennsylvania Power and Light Corporation and UGI Utilities for their performance of a removal response action at the site. EPA issued notice to proceed on March 16 2007, the PRP's contractor mobilized to the site on March 19, 2007, and completed construction of the removal action on September 18, 2007. The removal actions conducted by PRPs included design and construction features in anticipation of site reuse. More information on the removal action may be found at EPA OSC web site. Top of Page
