### Background

The Imperial Refining Company site is located in Ardmore in Carter County, Oklahoma. Imperial Refining Company operated a crude oil refining facility on site from 1917 until 1934. Waste piles found on site were characterized as dry, asphalt-like tar mats associated with oil-contaminated soil on top of oil-stained clay. The waste piles contaminated soil and sediment with hazardous chemicals. Following construction of the site’s remedy, EPA removed the site from the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in September 2013. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions. ODEQ conducts operation and maintenance activities for the site.

During remedial action, about 104,500 cubic yards of waste and soil and 1,700 cubic yards of sediment were removed from the site and shipped to an off-site landfill. In addition, for areas where waste remains in place, a clay barrier was constructed to mitigate migration and exposure to contaminants.

ODEQ and EPA have conducted five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The review also included recommendations for site maintenance and sediment sampling.

The Imperial Refining Company began operations at the site in 1917. The eastern portion of the property was purchased in April 1917. The western portion was purchased three months later. Imperial Refining Company remained active for 17 years until it went bankrupt in 1934. Due to the absence of environmental regulations during the operational period, no permits, violations, inspections or facility operation documentation have been identified, and no records have been found that describe the types of activities that took place on site. There were numerous pits, piles and water impoundments contaminated with metals and PAHs.The Imperial Refining Company began operations at the site in 1917.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy, selected in 2007 and updated in 2009, included excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated waste, sediment and soil, and containment for areas where waste remains in place. Cleanup finished in December 2012. Following cleanup, the site is monitored routinely for areas of erosion and lack of vegetative growth.

The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) has completed and filed all of the necessary institutional controls restricting site land uses to industrial uses. ODEQ took over site operation and maintenance responsibilities in December 2012.

Following construction of the site’s remedy, EPA took the site off the NPL in September 2013.
