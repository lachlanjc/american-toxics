### Background

The 1.5-acre Tri-State Plating site is located in Columbus, Indiana. Electroplating operations at the site contaminated soil and groundwater with cyanide and heavy metals, including chromium. Tri-State Plating stopped operating at the site in 1984. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1986. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in July 1997.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed using federal funds. Following cleanup, the site is currently available for unlimited use and unlimited access.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy is in place. The remedy was to extract and treat contaminated groundwater using existing on-site extraction wells. Groundwater cleanup goals were met in 1995 and all cleanup activities finished in the spring of 1997.

### Emergency Response and Removal

In 1987 and 1989, EPA did short-term cleanup work to address immediate threats posed by conditions at the site. The work included fencing the site, removing waste drums, contaminated soil and asbestos-containing materials, and building decontamination and demolition. Excavated areas were backfilled with clean soil, the fence was removed, and the site was regraded and revegetated.
