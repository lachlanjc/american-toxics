Background
The Railroad Avenue Groundwater Contamination site is in West Des Moines, Polk County, Iowa. The site consists of the West Des Moines water treatment plant well field, the area of observed groundwater contamination and the potential source areas of the contamination. The West Des Moines well field contains 22 municipal water supply wells that supply water to the West Des Moines water treatment plant. The West Des Moines water treatment plant provides drinking water to the city of West Des Moines. Most wells are only used periodically depending on seasonal water demand. The site is separated into two operable units (OUs). OU1 is designated as the northern groundwater plume, and OU2 is designated as the southern groundwater plume. The selected response action for OU1 consists of groundwater monitoring to confirm natural attenuation of contaminants is occurring and institutional controls, including well-permitting requirements to limit private use of groundwater. The selected response action for OU2 included continued operation of the aerators to treat water that enters the public water supply, restoration of the aquifer through natural attenuation processes and institutional controls.  In 2014, the EPA, in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, conducted an optimization study of the aerator operation and maintenance. The aerators originally consisted of a slat style construction but were upgraded to the packed media design in 2004 to remove site contaminants. The aerators were successful at removing site contamiants to below the maximum contaminant levels but West Des Moines Water Works still needed to continue utilizing the aerators to address the metals in groundwater. Since the aerators will need to be in service indefinitely for precautionary purposes and metals precipitation pre-treatment, the optimization study recommended retro-fitting the aerators back to a slat style construction to be more cost effective. In 2015, the aerators were retro-fit back to the slat style construction which will allow for addressing the fouling problems and ultimately eliminates the need for periodic packing material replacement which is costly.  The EPA completed the third Five-Year Review in August 2021. The review determined the remedies at both OU1 and OU2 are currently protective of human health and the environment. OU1 and OU2 are currently in the monitored natural attenuation phase of the remedy, and routine groundwater monitoring is conducted at both OUs to ensure the remedial actions are operating as intended and the contaminants continue to degrade.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site was first identified in 1993 when a routine water distribution sample collected by the city of West Des Moines was found to contain cis-1,2-DCE at 1.2 micrograms per liter (µg/L). Subsequent sampling of WDMW-13 detected cis-1,2-DCE at higher concentrations than in the water distribution sample. The contamination in the West Des Moines Water Works (WDMWW) municipal supply wells was formally brought to the attention of the EPA after a site investigation was conducted by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources in 1996. The EPA performed a Preliminary Assessment/Site Inspection for the WDMW-13 site in October 1997. Results of the PA/SI identified groundwater contaminants at locations along Railroad Avenue between municipal supply wells WDMW-12 and WDMW-13 and 10th Street.
An Expanded Site Inspection was conducted by the EPA in November and December 1999. Results from the ESI confirmed two separate source areas and groundwater contaminant plumes in the northern and southern portions of the study area and recommended further investigations to locate any other potential source areas. Even though these investigations involved extensive soil, water and sediment sampling, the source area for the northern plume operable unit, OU1, has not been identified. Based on these investigations and the impact of volatile organic compounds on the West Des Moines municipal wells, the EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List in December 2002. The EPA issued an Interim Record of Decision (ROD) in September 2003 to address contaminants captured by the West Des Moines well field and included institutional controls, extraction of contaminated groundwater using existing water supply wells and treatment of the extracted groundwater by upgraded aerators at West Des Moines Water Works treatment plant. An additional ROD was issued in September 2005, which addressed contaminants in the northern plume, OU1, not captured by the West Des Moines well field. The selected remedy included institutional controls and restoration of the aquifer by reduction of contaminants of concern through natural attenuation. The southern plume, OU2, is located northwest of wells WDMW-19, WDMW-20 and WDMW-21 where a release of trichloroethene (TCE) occurred during operations at a former metal brazing facility. The selected remedy for OU2 included continued operation of the aerators at the West Des Moines water treatment plant, continued operation of an air sparging system, restoration of the aquifer through natural attenuation and institutional controls. ﻿The remedies at both OU1 and OU2 are currently in the monitored natural attenuation phase. Routine groundwater sampling is conducted to ensure the contaminants continue to degrade.  The EPA completed the third Five-Year Review for the site in August 2021. The remedies at both OU1 and OU2 were determined to be protective of human health and the environment.   Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
OU1 - Routine groundwater sampling is being conducted by Iowa Department of Natural Resources to verify that the contaminants continue to degrade through natural attenuation processes.  OU2 - The air sparging system was turned off in 2009 in favor of the next phase of the remedy, monitored natural attenuation. Routine groundwater sampling is being conducted to ensure the contaminants continue to degrade through natural attenuation processes. The EPA completed the third Five-Year Review in August 2021. The review determined the remedies at OU1 and OU2 are protective of human health and the environment.  Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
The city of West Des Moines does not currently have institutional controls in place to prohibit the installation of new drinking water wells. However, ICs in the form of Polk County and Iowa Department of Natural Resources well-permitting requirements, limit the private use of groundwater. Iowa Administrative Code 567, Chapter 49 addresses the need to protect the public health by protecting groundwater supplies from contamination by establishing uniform minimum standards and methods for well construction and reconstruction for nonpublic water supply wells. Iowa Administrative Code 567-49.4 states, "The administrative authority shall by rule require the issuance of permits and the submission of well logs. No well construction or reconstruction shall be initiated until a permit has been issued by the proper authority." Prior to issuing a well permit, the Polk County Public Works Department contacts the local jurisdiction and IDNR to verify placement of the well is not within an area impacted by contamination.

Sampling and Monitoring
Routine groundwater sampling is being conducted at both OU1 and OU2 to ensure contaminants continue to degrade through natural attenuation processes.

Emergency Response and Removal
Cleanup has also included Removal Actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal Actions at the southern groundwater plume included construction of aerators to treat groundwater, operation and installation of air-sparging wells and monitored natural attenuation. Air-sparging activities ended in early 2009 and transitioned to monitored natural attenuation. Top of Page
