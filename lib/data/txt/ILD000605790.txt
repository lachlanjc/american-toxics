### Background

The Sauget Area 2 site is located in Sauget, Illinois. The 312-acre area includes four landfills – sites Q, R, S and P – and four backfilled lagoons, known as Site 0. Waste treatment and disposal activities at the site contaminated soil and groundwater with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides and metals. Parts of the site have been cleaned up. However, environmental risks remain and long-term cleanup is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 2000, EPA removed riverbank drums at Site Q Central and removed drums and soil at Site Q South. In 2002, the Agency issued an Administrative Order requiring the PRPs to construct a groundwater barrier wall, called a Groundwater Migration Containment System, or GMCS, next to the Mississippi River. Construction was completed in 2005. Between 2005 and 2009, the PRPs tested and made adjustments to the system. Since 2009, the GMCS has operated as required. In December 2013, EPA approved the site’s ROD, for Operable Unit 1which outlines EPA’s plan for cleaning up remaining contamination at the site. It is the first of two cleanup decisions and cleanup actions for the site. Three Five-Year Reviews have been completed for Sauget Area 2 in 2008, 2013, and 2018. The next FiveYear Review will be completed in 2023. In 2019, EPA and the Department of Justice entered into an agreement with the PRP to carry out the cleanup plan for Site P.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being cleaned up by the PRP under state and federal enforcement agreements and oversight. The PRP has completed the remedial design and construction of the cap for Site P in December 2021. On November 17, 2021, EPA signed a Consent Decree with the PRPs to implement the cleanup plan for the rest of the Sauget Area 2 sites (O, Q, R and S).
