### Background

The Woodbury Chemical Co. (Princeton Plant) site is located in Princeton, Florida. It includes the area where a pesticide and fertilizer formulation, distribution and sales facility began operations in 1975. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1990 because of contaminated groundwater and soil resulting from facility operations. EPA, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. EPA determined that the site does not threaten people living or working near the site or the environment and took the site off the NPL in 1995.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The 5-acre site is located in Princeton, Dade County, Florida. Site features include several buildings, warehouses and storage tanks. Agricultural, commercial and residential land uses surround the site. The site includes the area where Woodbury Chemical Company began formulating, distributing and selling pesticides and fertilizers in 1975. In 1990, EPA listed the site on the NPL. Woodbury Chemical Company and a farm supply store continued operations on site during cleanup activities. A residential development company purchased the site property in 2005. A vehicle maintenance and repair business and a salvage yard currently operate at the site.

- EPA led site monitoring activities in cooperation with FDEP.
- In 1990, site PRPs removed contaminated soils.
- In 1993, EPA conducted quarterly monitoring of on-site and off-site groundwater.
- EPA determined that the site did not threaten human health and the environment and took the site off the NPL in 1995.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1992, EPA issued the cleanup plan (a Record of Decision, or ROD) for the site. It documented EPA’s decision that no further cleanup action was required. EPA decided that no action was necessary to address groundwater at the site but monitored groundwater for one year to confirm the appropriateness of the no-cleanup action plan.  

EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 1995 and does not require Five-Year Reviews for the site.

### Sampling and Monitoring

EPA does not require Five-Year Reviews for the site as no further clean up acitivity is warranted.
