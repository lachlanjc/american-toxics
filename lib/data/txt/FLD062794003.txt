### Background

The 17.4-acre Schuylkill Metals Corp. [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) Site is the former location of a battery recycling facility that operated from 1972 to 1986. A railroad track runs adjacent to the northern boundary of the site.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1983 because of contaminated sediment, soil, surface water and groundwater resulting from former waste disposal practices.

EPA, the [Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP)](https://floridadep.gov/) and the Site’s potentially responsible party (PRP) have investigated Site conditions. By monitoring groundwater and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, FDEP and the Site’s [potential responsible parties (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) continue to protect residents and the environment from Site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the Site. The Site's soil and groundwater contamination is not a threat to nearby residents and businesses. Area residents and businesses are connected to the public water supply.

EPA took the Site off the NPL in 2001.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The PRPs lead Site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by the EPA and FDEP.

**1990**  
EPA issued a cleanup plan (a Record of Decision, or ROD) for the Site. It included

- digging up and treating contaminated soil and debris
- groundwater collection and treatment
- flood control measures
- fencing and monitoring of the east and west marshes
- operation and maintenance activities.

**1991**  
EPA issued an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) to update the site cleanup plan and address additional soil contamination found along the railroad track adjacent to the northern boundary of the site.

**1993**  
EPA issued a second ESD that changed the wetland cleanup approach approved in the 1990 ROD. Instead of permanently flooding the east marsh, the revised cleanup plan called for removing contaminated sediments and re-establishing both the east and west marshes.

The PRPs

- removed over 266,000 tons of contaminated soil and sediment from the former process area and wastewater pond
- consolidated, stabilized and solidified contaminated soil and sediment into a monolith and covered it with a vegetated soil cover.
- The PRPs monitored the air during the digging up, transportation and solidification of contaminated soil to make sure contamination did not affect area residents and businesses.

**1994 – 1996**  
EPA built a below-ground barrier wall surrounding contaminated ground water at the Site in December 1993 and operated a ground water pump-and-treat system from July 1994 until December 1996. During its operation, the plant treated between 15 and 18 million gallons of wastewater.

**1998**  
Restoration work is complete and the PRPs replanted the wetlands to create 11 acres of new wildlife habitat. The PRPs put in place all parts of the cleanup by September 1998.

**2001**  
EPA deleted the site from the NPL in August 2001.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The PRP put in place all parts of the cleanup by September 1998. EPA took the site off the NPL in August 2001.

EPA plans to complete the next Five-Year Review in 2021.

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11050186.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2016. The Sitewide Protectiveness Status currently protects human health and the environment in the short and long-term because it has been implemented according to the Site's decision documents.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with Site PRP to investigate and clean up the Site. The PRPs funded the Site’s cleanup and continue to fund Site monitoring activities. The PRP continues to reimburse the EPA for its oversight costs.
