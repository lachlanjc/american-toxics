### Background

The Global Landfill site in Old Bridge Township, New Jersey, is a 57.5-acre area operated by Global Landfill Reclaiming Corporation, or GLRC, as a solid waste landfill from about 1968 to 1984. The State of New Jersey permitted the landfill to accept waste classified as municipal waste, bulky waste, vegetative waste, and non-hazardous industrial waste. However, leachate from the landfill contaminated groundwater underneath the site due to the presence of drums containing paint, paint thinner, and various solvents that were buried in the landfill from 1968 to 1977. Leachate is the wastewater formed when rainwater or snow melt filters through wastes in a landfill; when this liquid comes in contact with buried wastes, it leaches, or draws out, chemicals from those wastes.

In April 1984, a slope failure on the southeast side of the landfill opened a fissure, or deep crack in the surface, about 60 feet wide, 600 feet long and 40 feet deep due to rapid filling of the eastern portion of the landfill, followed by a period of heavy rainfall and excessive high tides in the surrounding wetlands. The failed portion of the landfill exposed wastes, breached the perimeter dike, and filled a large portion of the adjacent wetlands with waste, including sediment with a high concentration of ammonia and other contaminants. The EPA?? filled in the area of the landfill that failed, topped it with a thin soil cover, and regraded that area. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, or NJDEP, ordered GLRC to stop disposing waste at the landfill in April 1984. Since that time, the landfill has been inactive. Old Bridge RE Urban Renewal, LLC currently owns the landfill site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**Potentially Responsible Parties:** The EPA ensures that Superfund sites are cleaned up by finding the companies or people responsible for contamination at a site and negotiating with them to do the cleanup themselves, or to pay for the cleanup done by another party. These potentially responsible parties, or PRPs, are individuals or companies that may have owned or operated the site; generated waste that was disposed of or released on the site; or may, in some way be responsible for causing or contributing to the contamination. The State of New Jersey and approximately 29 PRPs signed a legal document called a Consent Decree that required the companies to fund the work required to clean up and monitor the site.

**Landfill Capping:** In the site’s 1991 cleanup plan, documented in a Record of Decision, or ROD, the EPA and NJDEP selected a plan that included measures to stabilize the landfill’s sloped sides; cap the landfill with geotextiles and soil; install storm water and leachate management systems; install a system to collect and control gas generated by the landfill; install a perimeter security fence; and implement a monitoring program. In an August 2006 document titled “Explanation of Significant Differences”, the EPA updated the site’s landfill cap design from the 1991 ROD, with NJDEP’s concurrence, to use a lighter landfill cap design. This new design helps prevent another slope failure. It also eliminated the need to construct a large berm (a raised mound of soil) without negatively affecting the long-term safety and effectiveness of the cap or the leachate, stormwater, and landfill gas management systems. The PRPs began constructing the landfill cap in 2010 and completed all major elements of the construction in 2012.

**Groundwater, Surface Water and Surrounding Wetlands:** The site’s September 1997 ROD addressed the potential for contaminants to move from the landfill. The ROD included plans to remove contaminated sediment from the wetlands to the top of the landfill before it is capped; restrict well use; conduct annual groundwater review; monitor natural attenuation, or the use of natural processes to contain the spread of the contamination, in the groundwater; restore impacted wetlands; and replace wetlands that were lost during the original side-slope failure and negatively impacted by construction. PRPs completed these tasks in 2011.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The PRPs addressed the site in two long-term phases. They finished the cleaning and restoring the wetlands in September 2011 and placing the landfill cap in 2012. Currently, the PRPs inspect the landfill cap every month and mow the site once a year. They sample the groundwater two times every year by reviewing data?? from sixteen monitoring wells on and around the site.

In addition to ongoing coordination with NJDEP, the EPA continues to conduct a formal review of the site and all systems every five years, known as a “Five Year Review”. This thorough review uses site inspections, detailed record reviews, and discussions with the operators to ensure that the systems in place are operating properly, that the current cleanup methods are still the best approach for the specific site and contaminants, and that the approach protects people’s health and the environment.

In 2023, solar power developer AC Power LLC built a 2.8-megawatt solar power generation facility, operated by NJR Clean Energy Ventures, on top of the former waste pile. This facility provides 400 homes with reduced-cost electricity, 51% of which supports low- and moderate-income residents. Over the next 30 years, the facility will generate more than $1.2 million in revenue for Old Bridge Township. AC Power LLC also partnered with Solar One, an environmental education organization, on a career readiness program focused on renewable energy. This program includes a high-school internship program in nonprofit and corporate renewable energy, along with a college program that provides North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners certification training at the nearby County College of Morris, with AC Power providing funding that sponsors coursework and exams for students. Under these strategic partnerships, the Global Sanitary Landfill solar project and its related education programs are expected to benefit the community for years to come.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The EPA completed the first five-year review in July 2015 and its second five-year review in February 2020. Both reviews determined that the cleanup approach continues to be protective of people’s health and the environment. The PRPs continue to monitor groundwater two times every year and monitor the wetlands once a year.

### Enforcement Information

The state and the potentially responsible parties continued to work on amending a 1993 Consent Decree to include the OU-2 ROD and incorporate changes in the OU-1 ROD cap required by the ESD. The Administrative Consent Decree was finalized, signed, and entered in Federal court in September 2008.
