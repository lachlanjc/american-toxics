### Background

The 8-acre Metropolitan Mirror and Glass Co., Inc. Site is located in Frackville in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Metropolitan Mirror manufactured mirrors on site from 1959 to 1982. Metropolitan Mirror used silver solutions, paint strippers, paint thinners and other solvents. Wastes from these operations were disposed of in four settling lagoons, which contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. After construction of the Site’s remedy, EPA deleted the Site from the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in August 2005.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA studied the contamination and explored cleanup options during 1995 to 1996. EPA cleaned up the existing lagoons, by draining, excavating and backfilling them with clean soil. The contaminated soil in the drum storage area was also excavated. These measures were completed in September 1997. Site studies have shown that these measures were adequate, and the EPA will take no further action to clean up the site. It has been determined that the contaminants in groundwater and sediment are not Site related. The Site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

EPA conducted one five-year review of the Site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by Site decision documents. The [2003 Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/471020) concluded that the response actions at the Site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy is expected to continue to be protective of human health and the environment and no further reviews are required.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1998, EPA issued a “No Action” [Record of Decision (ROD)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/115002) for the Site. A removal action in 1997 adequately addressed Site contamination. After cleanup, EPA deleted the Site from the National Priorities List in August 2005.

### Emergency Response and Removal

The 1997 removal action included draining, excavating and backfilling the lagoons, and excavating and backfilling contaminated soil in a former drum storage area. EPA finished the cleanup in September 1997. After evaluating additional data collected after the removal action, EPA concluded that these measures were adequate, and EPA will take no further action to clean up the Site. EPA determined that contaminants in groundwater and sediment are not Site related.
