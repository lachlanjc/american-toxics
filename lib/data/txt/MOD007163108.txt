### Background

The North-U Drive Well Contamination Site consists of seven wells near Springfield, Missouri. An unknown source contaminated the wells with volatile organic compounds. Following an investigation, the EPA removed the site from the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in 1994 after it was determined that the contamination was from petroleum products, which are not addressable under the Superfund law.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal and state actions.

Under the EPA's removal program, public water supply lines were extended to North-U Drive to prevent exposure to contaminated groundwater.The EPA permanently plugged 62 private wells to prevent their use. No further action took place under the removal program because the contaminant releases no longer posed a significant threat to human health or the environment.
