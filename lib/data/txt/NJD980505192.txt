### Background

The Rolling Knolls Landfill site is in Chatham Township, New Jersey. A portion of the nearly 200-acre site was used primarily as a municipal landfill for over 30 years. The landfill operated from the early 1930s to 1968 and received a variety of waste, including household garbage, construction and demolition debris, industrial waste, septic waste, and scrap metal.

Most of the landfill is under private ownership. However, approximately 35 acres are owned by the U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) as part of the 7,700-acre [Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/great-swamp).

EPA placed the site on the Superfund National Priorities List in September 2003.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 2005, EPA entered into a legal agreement with several of the parties responsible for contamination at the site, called potentially responsible parties (PRPs), requiring them to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) under EPA oversight. The purpose of the remedial investigation is to determine the nature and extent of the contamination. The purpose of the feasibility study is to identify ways to address the risks posed by the contamination at the site and evaluate cleanup alternatives.

EPA oversaw the fieldwork for the RI, the majority of which was completed in January 2018. The fieldwork included sampling the soil, groundwater, surface water, sediment, and air to support our overall understanding of the site. EPA approved the RI Report in 2018. EPA also completed a baseline human health risk assessment in 2014, and updated it in 2018. An ecological risk assessment was completed by the PRPs in 2016 and approved by EPA.

The PRPs recently completed preliminary PFAS investigation in groundwater and a Feasibility Study is currently being conducted.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The PRPs are currently conducting a Feasibility Study to identify cleanup options for the site.
