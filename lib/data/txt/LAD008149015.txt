### Background

**Current Status**

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) completed it's fifth Five Year review on December 9, 2019. The fifth Five Year Review concluded that the remedy remains protective of human health and the environment. Discussions on reuse are being conducted between the city of Slidell and the current property owner. The landfill cap is inspected once every year and the remedy is evaluated every five years. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) and the site owner maintain the site. The site is in the operation and maintenance phase awaiting a Ready-for-Reuse proposal.

**Site Background**

The 56-acre Southern Shipbuilding site is located in Slidell, Louisiana. A barge cleaning, docking and repair facility operated on site from 1919 to 1993. The site included a graving dock where maintenance operations took place and two sludge pits used to dispose of wastes pumped from vessels. Scattered across the site were waste drums, containers, contaminated debris, scrap metal piles and abandoned equipment. Site activities contaminated soil, sediments and sludges with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1998.

**Location:** The site is a former barge cleaning, building, docking and repair facility located within St. Tammany Parish, in the city of Slidell, Louisiana. The site is located on approximately 55.8 acres at 999 Canulette Road, just down stream of the State Highway 433 Bridge and adjacent to Bayou Bonfouca, approximately 1.5 miles downstream of the Bayou Bonfouca Superfund site.

**Population:** Approximately 26,000 residents live in the surrounding community.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  
  
EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site's remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires continued maintenance of the vegetative cap, removal of tree growth, reseeding of barren areas to reduce erosion, inspection of the underwater cap over the graving dock and placing institutional controls on the Site.

David and Frank Canulette founded the facility in 1919 and incorporated it as the Canulette Shipbuilding Company (Canulette) in 1920. During and after World War II, Canulette constructed vessels for the U.S. Navy. In 1954, J&S Shipbuilding Corporation (J&S) purchased and operated the facility. The Seligman family acquired J&S in 1957 and changed its corporate name to the Southern Shipbuilding Corporation. Operations at the site included "gas freeing" (or the control of vapor build-up associated with cargo bearing barges), barge cleaning, ship construction and repairing operations. The Southern Shipbuilding Corporation filed a petition for bankruptcy and ceased operations in 1993. Equity Development Systems Limited currently owns the site property.

The facility included a graving dock where maintenance operations took place and two sludge pits used to dispose of wastes pumped from vessels. Scattered across the site were waste drums, containers, contaminated debris, scrap metal piles and abandoned equipment. The Louisiana Department of Natural Resources issued the Southern Shipbuilding facility two Compliance Orders in 1984 and 1987. In 1992, an investigation discovered that the levees around the sludge pits had failed and 325,000 gallons of materials had been released into Bayou Bonfouca. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality issued a third Compliance Order to Southern Shipbuilding, directing it to stop all unauthorized discharges and to comply with pollution control laws. An investigation by EPA determined that the north sludge pit was releasing material into the bayou.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The long-term remedy for the facility around the graving dock and the sludge pits included off-site incineration of pit wastes, on-site consolidation and capping of soils not addressed by incineration, on-site consolidation and capping of incinerator ash, and removal and incineration of tributyltin-contaminated sediments. Transport of the contaminated materials and incineration began in 1995. A clay layer in the graving dock limited exposure to remaining contaminated sediments. Annual inspections are ongoing.

Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1998.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The ROD for OU1 included: excavation of contaminated soil, sludge, and sediments and incineration off site; the disposal of residual ash under a two foot clay cap on-site; excavation of soils contaminated with PAHs under the SSC site clay cap; backfilling and grading all excavated areas; groundwater monitoring; and access controls and warning signs. The target depth was two feet for excavation of contaminated soil and debris during the cleanup and remedial actions conducted as a removal action for OU2. Sampling results from the RI and additional confirmatory sampling indicated that 23 acres in OU2 exceeded remedial action goals. These areas were excavated. Confirmation samples were collected when the initial excavation depth was less than two feet. The results of these samples were used to determine if additional excavation was necessary. Initially, no confirmation samples were collected if the excavation depth was two feet (E&E, I 996a). Subsurface soils samples were collected from the two foot interval in these excavations to document contaminant concentrations as a control at the one foot interval. Confirmation samples were also collected for areas where asbestos-containing material removals were conducted (E&E, 1997). The results of all confirmation samples indicate that the remedial action goals set in the September 1997 ROD for OU2 were met at all locations (E&E, 1997 and E&E, 1996a). The sample results and discussions are reported in the Removal Support Report: Part 2 - Operable Unit 2, Southern Shipbuilding Corporation, Slidell, St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana (E&E, 1996a) and the Removal Support Report: Part 2, Addendum 1 - Operable Unit 2, Southern Shipbuilding Corporation, Slidell, St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana (E&E, 1997). In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, representatives of the EPA collected environmental samples from SSC on September 30, 2005. On December 19, 2005, EPA reported that the SSC site sustained no appreciable damage from Hurricane Katrina (EPA 2008). Operation and maintenance at the site does not require any sample collection or data analysis of any environmental media.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions in 1993 and 1994 pumped down water in the sludge pits, treated the discharged waters, and installed sheet piling around the levees. Removal actions in 1996 excavated and disposed of contaminated soils and asbestos-containing material, and backfilled excavated areas with clean soil. Following these remedial actions, EPA selected “no further action” as the remedy for the rest of the site in 1997.
