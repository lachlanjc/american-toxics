Background
The 23-acre O'Connor Company site is in Augusta, Maine. In the 1950s, the company began operating a salvage and electrical transformer recycling business at the site. Operations included stripping and recycling transformers containing polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-laden oil. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing. 
In 1972, an oil spill at the site was found to have migrated towards Riggs Brook. Later that year, at the request of the state, the company began containing all transformer fluids found on the site in an aboveground storage tank to prevent future spills. When high levels of PCBs were detected in the soils during sampling by the state in 1976, the company was instructed to build two lagoons to control further migration of oils from the site. The upper lagoon, constructed with a concrete retaining wall and a discharge system, and a lower lagoon, constructed with a horizontal pipe discharge system and an earthen berm, were installed. In 1977, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection instructed the company to reclaim the lagoon areas. The company pumped water from the lagoons into several on-site storage tanks and excavated the lagoon sediments. These sediments were deposited into a low area and were covered with a foot of clay soil. This created a barrier for natural surface water drainage from the site to Riggs Brook and resulted in the formation of a marsh behind the on-site barn. The site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1983.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal and Settling Defendant actions. The posting of warning signs and the construction of a fence, which limited access to the contaminated areas of the site, and the removal of drums and storage tanks reduced the potential for exposure at the site prior to the full cleanup in 1997. As a result of the 1996-1997 cleanup, over 19,000 tons of contaminated soil and sediment were excavated and transported to appropriate disposal facilities. Sixty-four tons of barn debris was decontaminated, demolished and disposed of off-site. Finally, 71,220 gallons of contaminated water were transported to off-site disposal and treatment facilities. Following the source control excavation, clean fill was brought onto the site to restore the original site topography and provide a cover over the remaining soils. The site fencing was then removed. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review in 2017 concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. Exposure pathways to contaminated soils are prevented by the soil cover and institutional controls. Similarly, exposure to contaminated groundwater that remains within a 3 to 4 acre area are prevented by institutional controls and groundwater performance standards are being met outside this area. Ten years of sampling for Riggs Brook also found the remedy to be protective of human health and the environment. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
As described above, the site’s long-term remedy included the excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soils and sediments, with backfilling of excavated areas, fencing, wetlands restoration, and groundwater cleanup. Additionally, the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) established wetlands to replace those lost during the cleanup. The site’s groundwater remedy changed following a reassessment in accordance with EPA guidance on polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the technical practicability of restoring groundwater contaminated with PCB-contaminated oil within a reasonable timeframe. The revised remedy, updated in 2002, includes institutional controls, a technical impracticability (TI) waiver of federal and state drinking water ARARs for a limited portion of the site, active recovery of separate-phase PCB oil, long-term monitoring, and five-year reviews. Regular groundwater monitoring is ongoing. Sampling findings indicate that the groundwater beneath the rest of the site has met federal and state drinking water standards since 2006. Long-term monitoring and site maintenance are ongoing, ensuring that the soil cover remains intact and that the groundwater beyond the 3 to 4 acres area continues to meet drinking water standards.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Institutional controls are required for this site.
This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. All required institutional controls have been implemented and are annually reviewed for compliance. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.
The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remain onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
Disclaimer: This information is being provided by EPA as an informational tool to further assist the public in determining the types of restrictions that may be in place at National Priorities List sites being addressed by EPA under the Superfund program. In addition to the areas addressed by the institutional controls identified on this web site there may be other areas on the property that require restrictions on use of the property that are not captured in this EPA database. States and other entities may have implemented laws or restrictions applicable to this site. The information provided herein does not replace a title search or meet "All Appropriate Inquiry" requirements. U.S. EPA encourages users to review the Site files to obtain information regarding remedy components, containment systems and the land use for which cleanup standards were selected for these sites. More information and links can be found in the Institutional Control instrument collection of documents above, and the EPA regional offices may also be contacted. Top of Page
Emergency Response and Removal
Site cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1984, the O'Connor Company built a fence around the property and posted warning signs. The owner also sampled and analyzed the contents of all drums and storage tanks on the site and removed them. In 1987, Central Maine Power extended the fence to areas where additional contamination was found, and removed additional contaminated material from the site.
