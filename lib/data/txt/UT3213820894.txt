### Background

The 23,732-acre Tooele Army Depot (TEAD) (North Area) site is located in Toole, Utah. An active U.S. Army base has operated at the site since the early 1940s. Site operations, ammunition storage and equipment repair contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Remedial actions have taken place at several site areas. Investigations are underway at other areas to assess the nature and extent of contamination and explore appropriate cleanup options.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.

EPA provides regulatory oversight of Superfund activities at DOD sites. The Army is the lead investigator, providing funding and labor to identify and implement the remedy. EPA and state regulators review and approve work plans, reports, and remedial decision documents. Regulators confirm the remedy is in place and working.

The Army conducts separate five-year reviews for RCRA and Superfund. These reviews evaluate whether the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent reviews concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the selected remedies and the RCRA permit and that the remedy is protective of human health and the environment in the short term. All issues affecting protectiveness have been resolved since the 2013 Superfund five-year review.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has divided the site into 16 operable units (OUs), to better address cleanup. OUs 1–3 and 11-14 include over 50 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) solid waste management units (SWMUs). All of the site’s groundwater and some source areas, are regulated under a state RCRA permit. OUs 4–10 and 15-16 are being cleaned up under the Superfund program.

Long-term remedies have not yet been selected for all site areas. Components of the site’s remedy selected to date include excavation and off-site disposal of some contaminated soil; excavation, stabilization and on-site disposal of lead-contaminated soil; backfilling and capping of an existing excavation area; and land use controls (LUCs). Source control activities completed to date include removal of soil contaminated with explosives; removal of expended crowd-control devices (such as tear gas) from a trench; removal and decontamination of equipment at two sites; removal of a sump and contaminated soil at a battery-maintenance building; closure and removal of a waste-disposal sump; and soil vapor extraction and air sparging. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

Modelling and investigation of groundwater contamination continues, along with evaluation of methods to effectively manage the contamination and source areas. Groundwater treatment at this location was found to be ineffective and has been discontinued. The water treatment facility was decommissioned in 2016-17. Studies continue, to identify an appropriate groundwater remedy.
