Background
The 42-acre Kummer Sanitary Landfill site is located near Bemidji in Beltrami County, Minnesota. The landfill covers 35 acres. From 1971 until 1984, a solid waste landfill accepted municipal wastes on site. Beginning in 1974, demolition debris, consisting of fly ash and sawdust, was disposed of on site. The landfill was closed in 1985. Facility operations contaminated groundwater with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Following entry of the site into the State of Minnesota's Closed Landfill Program, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1997.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through the State of Minnesota's Closed Landfill Program. To make sure residents had clean water supplies, EPA and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) installed a new municipal drinking water well and connected 198 homes to the public water supply. MPCA also constructed a new multi-layer cap for the landfill.. This work finished in 1992. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review, conducted in 2018, concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy. The remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short-term. EPA also recommended that MPCA improve gas venting, confirm that vapor is not a risk at the Site, and sample groundwater for several potential new contaminants.

What Is the Current Site Status?
MPCA’s Closed Landfill Program regularly maintains the landfill and monitors for landfill gasses and contaminated groundwater. MPCA has also installed a solar-powered gas flare on the landfill. MPCA monitors the natural improvement of groundwater. Currently, arsenic, vinyl chloride, and 1,4-dioxane exceed risk-based levels in groundwater at the Site. The Minnesota Department of Health maintains a special well construction area to restrict drilling and pumping of groundwater in the area and ensure a safe water supply for the City of Bemidji.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Groundwater underlying the site contained VOCs, including vinyl chloride, xylenes, carbon tetrachloride, naphthalene, and other contaminants from the landfill wastes. Currently only arsenic exceeds federal drinking water standards and vinyl chloride also exceeds state standards. The Minnesota Department of Health maintains a Special Well and Boring Contruction Area to prevent wells in the plume area.
