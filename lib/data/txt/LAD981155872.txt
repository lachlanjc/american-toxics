### Background

**Current Status**

Record of Decision August 6, 2020.

**Site Background**

The Devil’s Swamp Lake site is located in East Baton Rouge Parish, about 10 miles north of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Industrial facilities have discharged wastes to the swamp since the 1960s. The site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) investigated the area to assess the nature and extent of contamination, and to explore appropriate cleanup options.

The remediation approach selected in the Record of Decision signed on August 6, 2020 will provide a clean habitat for fish and wildlife, which in turn will reduce polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposures to people who consume fish caught in the lake.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 2009, the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals completed a health consultation for the Alsen community water supply and determined that the water posed no public health risks.  
  
In 2010, EPA awarded a Technical Assistance Grant (TAG) for a local citizens’ group, Alsen/St. Irma Lee Community Enterprise, Inc., to hire a technical advisor to interpret site studies and site-related health information for area residents.  
  
Remedial investigation activities have included collection of sediment, crawfish and fish tissue samples. Sample analysis were completed in 2015.  
  
The Louisiana Department of Health & Hospitals, in coordinatin with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Louisiana Department of Wildlife & Fisheries reviewed the results from these samples and on August 12, 2015 updated the Advisory for Devil's Swamp/Bayou Baton Rouge.  
  
The updated advisory advice the following: DO NOT EAT FISH OR CRAWFISH FROM THIS AREA. This advisory supersedes a previous advisory issued in 1993. The state agencies continue to advise the public not to swim nor participate in other primary water contact sports in the area of concern.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA proposed the site for listing on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2004.

DECEMBER 2015 - One (1) hard copy, and one (1) copy on jump drive (pdf format), of the recently completed "Final Tier 2 Remedial Investigation (RI) Report" was delivered to the Scotlandville Branch of the East Baton Rouge Parish Library and is available to the public. This, and other site records, are also available in the internet via the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ), Electronic Document Management System (EDMS). The next step is for the PRPs to prepare a work plan to complete a Feasibility Study (FS).
