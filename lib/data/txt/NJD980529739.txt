### Background

The 500-acre Ringwood Mines/Landfill site is in a historic iron mining district in the borough of Ringwood in Passaic County, New Jersey. Site features include abandoned mine shafts and pits, inactive landfills and open waste dumps.

Magnetite mines operated on the site property as early as the 1700s. Entities including the Ford Motor Company and the Borough of Ringwood disposed of wastes at the site since the 1960s. The site is about a half-mile wide and 1.5 miles long. It consists of rugged forested areas, open areas overgrown with vegetation, abandoned mine shafts and surface pits, an inactive landfill, and an industrial refuse disposal area. Also on site are small surface-level dumps, a municipal recycling center, the Ringwood Borough garage, and about 50 private homes.

Mining ended at the site in the early 1900s. The history of the site between 1900 and the late 1930s is unclear. The U.S. Government purchased the site property just prior to 1940. It was later sold to a series of owners. Ringwood Realty, a Ford subsidiary, owned the property from 1965 until 1974.

During this period, Ford disposed of wastes, including car parts and paint sludge, on the ground and in abandoned mine pits. A Ford contractor used the 500-acre area to dispose of paint sludge and other wastes from Ford’s Mahwah facility. Ford disposed of wastes in the Peters Mine Pit while both Ford and the Borough of Ringwood disposed of wastes in Cannon Mine. Peter's Mine contains paint sludges, solvents and scrap metal. Several drums containing chemical waste existed in Cannon Mine.

Ringwood Realty donated 290 acres in the southern portion of the site in 1970 to the Ringwood Solid Waste Management Authority, which began operating a permitted municipal disposal area in 1972. The State of New Jersey closed the landfill in 1976.

After site contaminants were discovered, Ford took actions to remove contamination to protect human health and the environment under EPA oversight. Site investigations and long-term cleanup activities continue.

Following immediate cleanup actions and site investigations, EPA originally placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1983. The site was deleted from the NPL in 1994. EPA placed the site on the NPL in 2006 a second time after discovering more contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**Immediate Actions:** The Ford Motor Company removed and disposed of off-site 7,000 cubic yards of paint sludge and associated soil from four on-site areas between 1987 and 1988. Sixty drums containing waste and paint sludge were discovered in early 1990. Under EPA oversight, Ford removed and disposed of off-site the drums and 600 cubic yards of paint sludge. Ford also disposed of off-site additional solidified paint sludge (about five cubic yards) discovered in April 1995.

More paint sludge was discovered at the site in 1997. Ford removed an additional 100 cubic yards of paint sludge and associated soil in December 1997 and January 1998. Ford put the excavated paint sludge in containers and transported them for disposal at an appropriate off-site facility. EPA determined in April 2004 that significant amounts of paint sludge still remained at the site. Ford subsequently removed additional paint sludge and drums from December 2004 through 2014.

Under EPA oversight, Ford has removed and disposed of off-site over 53,500 tons of paint sludge and associated soil since December 2004.

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) began investigating residential properties at the site in October 2005. Residential sampling collected in 2011 found high levels of lead in soil on some residential properties. In response, EPA removed lead-contaminated soil from 23 residences at the site from 2011 through 2014.

**Long-term Cleanup:** EPA and Ford addressed paint sludge and other industrial waste at the site by removing them, as described above. EPA began long-term sampling of groundwater and surface water in 1989. That sampling continues. Ford regularly annually samples surface water at the site, including as recently as [February 2023](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/654640.pdf).

Results continue to show that contamination at the site is not affecting the Wanaque Reservoir, which is a source of drinking water. Groundwater sampling shows scattered high levels of some contaminants, including [arsenic](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=19&toxid=3) and [lead](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=93&toxid=22). Sampling also detected [benzene](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/substances/ToxSubstance.aspx?toxid=14) and [1,4-dioxane](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=954&toxid=199) in groundwater at the site. EPA issued a [Record of Decision](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-finalizes-cleanup-plan-address-groundwater-contamination-ringwood-mineslandfill) (ROD) in September 2020 to select a cleanup plan for groundwater contamination at the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is addressing the site in two stages: immediate actions and a long-term cleanup phase focused on the entire site.

Ford’s removal of large amounts of paint sludge and contaminated soil from the site reduced the potential for exposure to hazardous materials. In addition, Ford, under EPA oversight, removed 113 drums of waste materials from non-residential areas off-site. Since the discovery of additional paint sludge at the site in 2004, Ford continues to conduct groundwater sampling under EPA oversight.

Ford fenced remaining landfill areas to reduce the potential for exposure to site-related contaminants until cleanup actions for these areas are completed.
