### Background

The Hassayampa Landfill site is located about 10 miles west of Buckeye, Arizona. For an 18-month period between 1979-1980, hazardous waste was dumped at this 10-acre site. The waste consisted of 3.28 million gallons of liquids and 4.150 tons of solids in unlined pits. The landfill pits were subsequently covered with native soil and restored to grade. The area was unlined, so chemicals from the waste seeped into the groundwater and soils. As part of the long-term remedy, maintenance of the soil cover, soil and groundwater treatment, monitoring and other site cleanup actions are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. EPA is the lead regulatory agency, with technical support provided by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ). Following the signing of the site’s Consent Decree in 1994, the Hassayampa Steering Committee (HSC) has undertaken the majority of the work at the site.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review in 2021 concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The groundwater and soil vapor extraction and treatment systems will continue to operate until groundwater and soil vapor contamination meet cleanup levels. The next five-year review will be completed by the end of September 2026.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Since 1992, the site's long-term remedy of cleanining up contaminated groundwater consists of:

- pumping contaminated groundwater and treating it using air stripping;
- reinjecting the treated water back into the groundwater; and
- ongoing groundwater monitoring.

The remedy also addresses contaminated soil through:

- removal and treatment of contaminated soil vapor using a soil vapor extraction (SVE) system and treatment of soil vapors with granular activated carbon;
- landfill capping, and;
- deed and access restrictions to control future use of the site property.

Since 1994, the pump and treat groundwater system has removed approximately 400 pounds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A soil cap was constructed in 1994 to prevent erosion and infiltration of contaminants into the groundwater. The original SVE system operated from 1996 to 1999. It was shut down after the system failed several compliance tests for destruction efficiency. It removed about 3,700 pounds of VOCs. The SVE system was upgraded in 2006 and more than 223,000 pounds of VOCs have been recovered. The SVE system is periodically turned off to determine if cleanup levels have been met based on certain criteria. If not, the system is re-started.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The site is secured by a fence and is not accessible to the public. The use of the site is currently restricted to cleanup activities.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Groundwater depths and chemical concentrations are measured quarterly from the site groundwater monitoring and extraction wells. Groundwater treatment system influent is sampled quarterly and effluent is sampled monthly. When the SVE system is operating, the influent and effluent is sampled monthly, and the soil vapor monitoring wells are sampled at least twice a year. The HSC provides an evaluation of the data to EPA in a report twice a year.
