### Background

The 7-acre Ripon City Landfill site is located in Fond Du Lac County, Wisconsin. The site, a former gravel pit, was owned by a private party who leased the land to the Speed Queen Corporation in 1967 for landfilling. The city of Ripon began leasing the property in 1968 for waste disposal, and in 1969 was licensed to operate the landfill. Later, the town of Ripon joined with the city in operating the landfill. The landfill operated until 1983, accepting municipal, commercial and industrial solid wastes. Facility operations contaminated groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Site cleanup and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

The last review concluded that response actions continue to protect people and the environment in the short term. For the site’s source control cleanup, to achieve long-term protectiveness, enhanced gas extraction must be put in place to maintain gas control. For the site’s groundwater cleanup to achieve long-term protectiveness, a cleanup to address the contaminated plume in addition to the alternative water supply and the active gas extraction system must be put in place. Long-term protectiveness of the groundwater will be achieved when groundwater reaches safe cleanup levels.

Sitewide long-term protectiveness will be achieved when the additional components are put in place and groundwater reaches safe controls, which will be ensured by implementing effective institutional controls and through long-term stewardship to monitor, maintain and enforce them as well as maintaining site the site cleanup.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, in consultation with EPA, completed a [five-year review of the Ripon City Landfill Superfund site (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/508826.pdf) (70 pp, 2.98MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) )

The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure that the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This was the fourth five-year review of this site.
