### Background

The Naval Security Group Activity site is located next to Sabana Seca in Puerto Rico, about 11 miles west of San Juan. The 2,200-acre facility is a naval communications station that operates a high-frequency direction finding facility. The site is divided into North and South Tracts. From the early 1950s through 1970, the operation's Public Works Department deposited all waste from the station at various areas on the South Tract. Communications facilities were, and still are, located on the North Tract. Waste materials included paints, solvents, waste oil and battery acid. A pest control shop also operated on the South Tract from the 1950s through 1979. During operations workers spilled various pesticides around the shop building. They also mixed pesticides and cleaned applicators in a sink outside the shop that discharged directly to the ground. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Various cleanup efforts occurred after which the EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in October 1998.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The 2,200-acre facility is a naval communications station that operates a high-frequency direction finding facility. The site is divided into North and South Tracts. From the early 1950s through 1970, the operation's Public Works Department deposited all waste generated at the station at various areas on the South Tract. Communications facilities were and still are located on the North Tract. Based upon historical records, materials included paints, solvents, waste oil and battery acid. In addition, a pest control shop also was run on the South Tract from the 1950s through 1979. and because of these various operations throughout the facility, these areas of potential concern required investigation. around the shop building. They also mixed pesticides and cleaned applicators in a sink outside the shop that discharged directly to the ground.

In 1984, soil samples showed elevated levels of arsenic, lead and chlordane. Rain could wash soil contaminants through a drainage ditch to a marsh, and the fractured limestone bedrock may allow pollutants to move into the groundwater. Initial studies base wide identified seven potentially contaminated sites, including the former pest control shop and a leachate ponding area, although the source of the leachate is a municipal landfill adjoining the base.

After initial actions to protect human health and the environment, and additional investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in October 1989

Initial Action: In 1988, the Navy fenced the former pest control shop to prevent exposure to the spilled pesticides. The site of the former pesticide shop is next to a family housing area and a playground. The fence has prevented contact with any soil that may still be contaminated with residual pesticides.

Pest Control Shop: Following a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the nature and extent of site contamination and to evaluate remedial alternatives, EPA selected a remedy for soil and water pollution in the site’s September 1996 Record of Decision, or ROD. The remedy – installation of an asphalt cap – was put in place in 1997 and the area is now used for parking.

Pistol Range Disposal and Leachate Pond Areas: Beginning in 1993, the Navy began an investigation of the pistol range disposal and leachate pond areas. Contaminated leachate at the leachate ponding area originates from the municipal landfill off site, but was included in the studies to protect base water supplies. Several monitoring wells were installed to determine whether the Navy’s water supply is in danger. The pistol range is still active. Therefore, unless a release to groundwater is documented, any cleanup at this area will be deferred until after the site’s closure. The municipality of Toa Baja, the party responsible for the contamination, will address the leachate ponding area.

Disposal Areas: Beginning in 1993, the Navy started screening site investigations of the disposal areas at the pistol range, bunker 607, and North and South Stone Road to determine the need for further remedial investigation. EPA determined in the site’s September 1997 RODs that no further action was needed to address these disposal areas.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site was addressed in three stages: an initial action and two long-term remedial phases focused on cleanup of pesticide shop soil and water pollution, and cleanup of the pistol range disposal and leachate pond areas. In addition, screening site investigations took place at several other areas of the base (S. Stone Rd. Disposal Area, Bunker 607 Disposal Area, N. Stone Rd. Disposal Area) to determine the need for further analysis of these areas.  

After cleanup was completed in 1997, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in October 1998.
