Background
The three-acre Wade site is located immediately north of the Commodore Barry Bridge in Chester, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. A rubber recycling facility operated at the site from 1950 until the early 1970s, and then an illegal industrial waste storage and disposal facility operated on site until 1978. Workers stored drums on site or dumped their contents either directly onto the ground or into trenches. In 1978, a fire destroyed one building and caused extensive damage to two others used for stockpiling drummed wastes. Burned building debris, exploded drums, tires, shredded rubber and contaminated soil littered the property. Waste disposal activities and the subsequent fire had contaminated soil and groundwater. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983. Following cleanup, the site was deleted from the NPL in 1989. Monitoring of the site is ongoing. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In 1981 and 1982, EPA undertook two separate emergency actions to clean up this site. Workers removed 5,000 gallons of PCB-contaminated waste and 10,000 gallons of other hazardous wastes for incineration. They also removed 155 tons of contaminated solids. The long-term remedy for the site was selected in 1984. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, now the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP), managed the final site cleanup, which was started in 1987, and completed in the same year. That cleanup included: removing, decontaminating, and disposing of tires, tankers, waste piles, and buildings; contaminated soil removal; and site leveling, filling, and grading. The contaminated soil was removed to depths with acceptable levels of contamination or to the level of the water table. After grading, the site was covered with topsoil and seeded to minimize erosion. EPA, in conjunction with the state, deleted the site from the National Priorities List in 1989. Five-Year Reviews of the final remedy have been conducted since 1993, each concluding that the site remains protective of human health and the environment. In 2004, with EPA and state approval, the site was upgraded with an asphalt surface, greenscaping and new stormwater drainage features, and put into use as an open air parking facility to provide parking for the City of Chester's new Barry Bridge Park complex constructed on the adjacent property. The Five-Year Review of the remedy that year concluded that the site continued to be protective of human health and the environment and that the redevelopment activities had actually improved the original remedy, further increasing the level of protectiveness. In 2008, the adjacent Barry Bridge Park property was selected as the future site of the Chester Soccer stadium and construction activities began in 2009. EPA worked with the City of Chester to ensure that activities related to the construction and redevelopment of that property did not negatively impact the site, which continued in use as a parking facility.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site has been redeveloped and is currently in use as a public parking facility. EPA and PADEP continue to monitor the site﻿. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the Site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by Site decision documents. The most recent, 2018 Five-Year Review (PDF), concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. Waste, debris and contaminated soils were removed in the original response action, and the remaining soil was capped in placed with the construction of an asphalt parking facility. Nearly three decades of groundwater sampling data has shown that groundwater contamination beneath the site has declined to very low or non-detect levels. This site is expected to remain protective of human health and the environment. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2023.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Institutional controls exist on the site to restrict groundwater use and other activities. Any new activity, including excavations and construction, must receive prior approval from both EPA and PADEP. For more information on the institutional controls, please see the 2018 Five-Year Review (page 5).
