Background
The 4.5-acre William Dick Lagoons site is located in West Caln Township, Pennsylvania. From the late 1950s to 1970, Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc. cleaned petroleum products, latexes and resins from its tank trailers and dumped rinse water and residues into three unlined lagoons at the site. Waste disposal activities contaminated soil and groundwater. The site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List in July 22, 1987. The site’s long-term remedy, selected in 1991 and 1993 and updated in 1999, included extension of the public water supply, a hydrogeological study, implementation of an interim groundwater treatment system, and excavation and treatment of contaminated soil. The hydrogeological study took place between 1997 and 1999. Construction of the water line for the public water supply took place in 1998 and 1999. Operation of the groundwater treatment system began in 2008 and is ongoing. Soil cleanup activities began in 2003. Top of Page

What Is the Current Site Status?
 The first Five-Year Review of the site’s remedy is now available. A Five-Year Review ensures that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The 2022 Five-Year Review (PDF), concluded that the remedy is protective of human health and the environment in both the long-term and short-term. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2027.  Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Institutional controls are in place at the site. Institutional controls are administrative and legal controls that help minimize the potential for human exposure to contamination and/or protect the integrity of the remedy. Additional information about the institutional controls are available in the 2022 Five-Year Review (PDF) (page 15).

Emergency Response and Removal
Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions in 1971 included sampling materials in the lagoons, spraying remaining liquid over the adjacent land surface, filling the lagoon pits with soil, and revegetating the filled areas. Removal actions in 1987 included fencing of the former lagoon area, periodic sampling of residential wells near the site, and installation of carbon filters at residential wells affected by site contamination.
