### Background

The Dover Chemical Corporation site is in Dover, Ohio. The 60-acre area includes three parcels of land – an active chemical manufacturing facility owned by Dover Chemical Corporation (Dover Chemical) and two undeveloped properties. Dover Chemical has operated its facility since 1950. Facility operations from the 1950s to the early 1970s introduced contaminants into soil and groundwater near the plant.

EPA has broken down the site into two Operable Units (OUs) that require cleanup. The two OUs are:

**OU1:** Dover Chemical Corporation Superfund site, also referred to as **“on-site”**, which is undergoing a removal action controlled by a 2000 Administrative Order on Consent.

**OU2:** The **“off-site groundwater plume”**, which extends from the southern boundary of OU1 and is subject to a 2018 Remedial Design/Remedial Action Consent Decree.

Between 1981 and 1986, Dover conducted several voluntary investigations of the Dover Chemical Corporation Superfund Site and submitted a draft Feasibility Study (FS) to United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA). The study identified four areas of concern: 1) plant area soils; 2) lagoon and canal area soils; 3) plant area groundwater and 4) the off-site groundwater plume.

Dover entered into a three-party Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) with U.S. EPA and Ohio EPA on August 24, 1988, under which Dover agreed to complete a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (“RI/FS”). During the RI investigation, dioxins and benzene hexachloride, and other chemicals of concern, were discovered in soils at Operable Unit 1. Based on the concentrations of the additional chemicals found, U.S EPA requested that Dover conduct a short-term cleanup on-site known as an interim removal action. The purpose of the removal action was to reduce the mobility and potential for contact with contaminated soils. On July 1991, Dover and U.S. EPA entered into an AOC to conduct interim soil cleanup at OU 1 and at adjacent off-site roadways used by Dover Chemical truck traffic.

In 1993, U.S. EPA proposed the Dover Chemical Corporation Superfund Site to the Natural Priorities List (NPL). At the time the Site consisted only of Operable Unit 1. Although the listing was never finalized, EPA began a series of enforcement actions and investigations that resulted in the 1994 RI/FS for O U 1. In August 1999, EPA determined that an additional short-term cleanup, known as a non-time critical removal action, would be appropriate to address the plant area soils, lagoon and canal area soils, and the plant area groundwater, to prevent and mitigate further releases of contamination to the environment. On October 2000, Dover and EPA entered into an AOC requiring Dover to conduct a non-time critical removal action at the facility.

Between 200 and 2008, an investigation of the off-site groundwater plume that spread south of the facility was made. Groundwater monitoring identified nine contaminants of concern, including benzene, monochlorobenzene, chloroform and trichloroethene. In 2001, Dover submitted an FS addendum report for the off-site groundwater plume to gather additional data to evaluate Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) as a viable groundwater cleanup option. Natural attenuation relies on natural processes to decrease or “attenuate” concentrations of contaminants.

In 2013, Dover prepared and submitted to U.S. EPA a second FS addendum report. Dover installed an extensive network of instruments designed to measure pressure, or piezometers, which demonstrated a groundwater flow gradient toward the facility. The existing groundwater pumping system, which operates pursuant to the 2000 AOC, prevents contaminated groundwater from leaving Operable Unit 1.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions, with oversight provided by U.S. EPA and Ohio EPA. Staff have done extensive cleanup, responded to residents’ concerns, and conducted investigations at the site.

In accordance with an October 2000 AOC, Dover Chemical is addressing the contaminated on-site groundwater in OU 1 via a pump and treat system. This system captures contaminated groundwater on-site so that it does not continue to migrate off-site, and treats the contaminated water via air stripping before discharging to a nearby surface water body under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. Dover Chemical has also installed soil vapor extraction systems at two locations on-site to address contaminant source areas. These systems reduce soil gas contamination in the source areas and prevent additional groundwater contamination from migrating off-site.

In 2015, U.S. EPA issued a [Record of Decision (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/494234.pdf) (128 pp, 19MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) to address the off-site groundwater contamination (OU2) associated with the site. The selected remedy includes:

- In-Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO) injections in a grid near the origin of the off-site plume. ISCO works by adding a substance that transforms groundwater contaminants into less harmful chemicals.
- Injections of an aerobic amendment along the center line of the plume that extends from the origin. Aerobic amendments reduce the toxicity of the contaminants in the presence of oxygen.
- Monitored natural attenuation (MNA). It relies on natural processes to decrease concentrations of contaminants.

No one is currently exposed to the contamination within the off-site plume.

On January 12, 2018, a [Consent Decree (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/937747.pdf) (200pp, 20.8MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) was entered by the Court for response actions and costs relating to OU2. Under the Consent Decree, Dover Chemical agrees to perform Remedial Design/Remedial Action (RD/RA) for OU2, estimated to cost $7.4 million. Dover also agrees to pay past and future response costs incurred by the EPA.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In October 2018, EPA approved Dover Chemical’s Phase 1 Pre-Design Investigation Work Plan which outlined pre-design soil boring locations and the installation of groundwater monitoring wells. The purpose of the work plan was to support the initial phase of the remedial action that includes injection of chemical oxidant at the origin of the Offsite Plume,located near the Site boundary.

Dover completed the pre-design field work in two sessions.(The first one in November and December of 2018, and the second one in June and July 2019. In July 2019, Dover completed pre-design field work with the installation and sampling of an additional 25 groundwater monitoring wells, and 16 soil borings.

In July 2020, Dover Chemical submitted Phase I, Pre-Design Investigation Evaluation Report for Operable Unit 2. This report summarizes the soil and groundwater investigations performed, interpretation of the data results and conclusions and recommendation for next steps in the remedial design.
