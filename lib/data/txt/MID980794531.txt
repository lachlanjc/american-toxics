### Background

The 5-acre Gratiot County Golf Course site is located in St. Louis, Michigan. From 1956 to 1970, the Michigan Chemical Corporation (later purchased by the Velsicol Chemical Corporation) burned and disposed of industrial waste, including the pesticide DDT, on the site. Site operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. In 1982, Velsicol cleaned up the site. However, site investigations continue in conjunction with an investigation at the neighboring Velsicol Chemical Corp. Superfund site. EPA placed the Gratiot County Golf Course site on the Superfund programâ€™s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2010. Cleanup plans are under development.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1982, an initial cleanup disposed of contaminated soils from the site. A concurrent cleanup at neighboring sites addressed contaminated groundwater underlying the golf course area. A golf course continues to operate on site while cleanup actions continue at related NPL sites in the area.

In 2006, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) investigated the "former burn area" at the golf course as part of an investigation of the nearby Velsicol Chemical Corp. site. MDEQ and EPA concluded the former burn area required additional cleanup. MDEQ and EPA are currently developing a cleanup plan for the site.
