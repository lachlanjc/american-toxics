### Background

The 209-acre Crossley Farm site is located in a rural area in Hereford Township, Pennsylvania. A farm has been located on site since 1927. From the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, the Bally Case and Cooler Company disposed of numerous drums of liquid waste at the site. These activities contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals, specifically trichloroethylene (TCE). The site was added to the National Priorities List in 1992, making it eligible for investigation and cleanup under the federal Superfund program.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

In 1983, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (now called the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection or PADEP) sampled residential wells down-gradient from the site and found that they were contaminated with various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as trichloroethylene (TCE). Due to the sampling results, the agency issued a warning to residents not to drink water from their residential wells and the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency provided temporary bottled water for the community. EPA addressed the drinking water supply to the surrounding residences by installing carbon filtration units that remove the TCE.

The site’s Record of Decisions, or remedies, for groundwater includes installation of point-of-entry drinking water filtration systems at affected residences; pumping and treating the regional groundwater; installation of residential vapor mitigation systems; and groundwater use restrictions.

- [September 2001 Record of Decision](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/377415)
- [July 2008 Record of Decision Amendment for Operable Unit 2 - Groundwater](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2099901)

The regional groundwater is being treated in a treatment plant on the farm property using air stripper technology and carbon filtration to remove the TCE contamination. The treated water is released into discharge galleries that lead to the Perkiomen Creek. The treatment plant facility is 140 x 75 feet in size and approximately 22 feet high. The treatment plant is located on the farm property near Huff's Church Road. There are four extraction wells that pump the water into the treatment plant. These four wells pump approximately 60 gallons of water per minute. The pump-and treat system helps stop the contaminated groundwater from migrating as it is being treated. The vapors from the air stripping technology are also treated before being released into the atmosphere.

EPA has installed over 100 monitoring wells in the vicinity of the site. Past levels of TCE have been detected in the groundwater as high as 700,000 micrograms per liter. The drinking water standard for TCE is 5 micrograms per liter. Since the pump-and-treat facility began operations in 2012, levels are decreasing.

In 2012, EPA issued an [Record of Decision (ROD) (PDF) for Operable Unit 3](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2157710) to address potential vapor intrusion as a result of the TCE contamination. EPA installed vapor intrusion mitigation systems (similar to radon systems) at 20 residences that are located above the site-related groundwater contamination plume. The vapor intrusion mitigation systems address potential risk to human health by reducing and/or eliminated an exposure pathway. The installation of the vapor intrusion systems was completed during summer 2015.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and EPA continue to monitor and sample more than 100 monitoring wells and residential wells in the vicinity of the site. These tests are done every year for monitoring wells and residential wells with point of entry treatment systems and every two years for other residential wells in the vicinity of the site.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent, [2019 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2282863), concluded that the remedies continue to be protective of human health and the environment. More information on the groundwater cleanup and 2019 Five-Year Review can be found in the [December 2019 Community Update](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2292922). The next five-year review is scheduled for 2024.

EPA evaluated the source area at the site where the highest concentrations of contamination have been detected. The source area is located at the top of Blackhead Hill on the farm property. The Crossley Farm Superfund Site is currently performing a cleanup to address the source area. EPA began the cleanup work in April 2023 and expects the work to be completed in early 2025. This work includes installing groundwater extraction wells, piping it to the existing treatment plant, and expanding the existing treatment plant to be able to treat the additional highly contaminated groundwater.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls restrict or limit future land and/or groundwater use, to protect the integrity of the remedy in place. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has placed a HSCA 512 Order, which is a deed restriction on use of the property where groundwater contamination is present. Additional information about the institutional controls is available in the [2019 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2282863).

### Sampling and Monitoring

Site-related groundwater monitoring and bi-annual residential well testing is ongoing.

Part of the OU-2 remedy involves discharging treated groundwater into the unnamed tributary to the West Branch Perkiomen Creek. The section of the West Branch Perkiomen Creek (WBPC) upstream of the site is classified as an Exceptional Value Cold Water Fishery (EV-CWF) Stream by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. At the request of the EPA Region III Biological Technical Assistance Team (BTAG), a baseline study of the WBPC was conducted prior to treated water discharge. The study established baseline condition assessments of the fish and benthic macroinvertebrate communities, water temperature and water quality conditions both upstream and downstream of both the Crossley Farm Superfund Site as well as the nearby Bally Superfund Site. The " [Crossley Farm Superfund Site 2008 Baseline survey of the Fish Community, Benthic Macroinvertibrate Community, Water Temperature and Water Chemistry of the West Branch Perkiomen Creek, Berks County, Pennsylvania (PDF)](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2178915) " baseline survey is available for public review.

Also available upon request is the Revised Hydrogeological Report, dated January 2014.
