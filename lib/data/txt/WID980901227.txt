### Background

Fadrowski Drum Disposal site, which is comprised of 20 acres of semi-rural land, is located on South 27th Street 20 in Franklin, Wisconsin. The city of Franklin is located just outside of the Milwaukee city limits. Between 1970 and 1982, demolition and construction waste was accepted there. Buried drums containing liquids and sludges were also discovered. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, an in-depth study of the nature and extent of contamination and an evaluation of cleanup options were done. The results confirmed chemicals in the groundwater and on-site creek.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA removed the site from its Superfund list in 2005 and continues to conduct five-year reviews to ensure that the cleanup measures remain protective.

Cleanup at the site included removing buried drums and contaminated soil, closing an on-site pond, covering waste with a landfill cap, installing a collection system to stop landfill liquids from going off-site, monitoring groundwater, fencing the area, and creating institutional controls.

Menards, Inc. purchased the site and adjacent land in 1983 and constructed the Menard's Home Improvement Center. Menard's, a company responsible for the cleanup, signed a legal agreement with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to ensure that operation and maintenance would continue.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Regular Operations and Maintenance activities are ongoing. The site was in the environmental monitoring phase from 1995 through 2013. Site-related contaminants have declined in the groundwater and cleanup goals have been met.

site in 2018. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.

This review included an evaluation of background information, cleanup requirements, effectiveness of the cleanup, and maintenance and monitoring efforts. It also looked at ways to operate more efficiently. The review concluded that the cleanup is protecting people and the environment.

More information is available in the administrative record on this web page and at the Franklin Public Library at 9151 W Loomis Rd in Franklin, WI 53132.

The next scheduled review will be in 2023.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Groundwater continues to be monitored on a regular basis.

### Enforcement Information

EPA closed out its legal agreement with the companies responsible for the cleanup and transferred enforcement authority to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources in 2005. Another agreement was signed between Menards, Inc. and WDNR in March 2005 to ensure the continued operation and maintenance of the site. The groundwater continues to be monitored as required under the 2005 agreement.
