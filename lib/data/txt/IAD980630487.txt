### Background

The 80-acre Vogel Paint & Wax Co. site is located approximately 2 miles south of Maurice, Sioux County, Iowa. From 1971 to 1979, the Vogel plant in nearby Orange City, Iowa disposed of paint-related waste at the site in a series of trenches. The waste consisted of paint sludge, resins, solvents and other solid wastes. As a result, soil and groundwater beneath the site were contaminated with volatile organic compounds (including benzene, toluene, ethylene and xylene) and metals (including arsenic, cadmium, chromium and lead).

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Beginning in 1979, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) and Vogel conducted initial investigations at the site. In 1984, Vogel placed a cap over the entire disposal area. Based on the conditions known in 1984, when the site was proposed to be included on the EPA's National Priorities List (NPL), approximately 43,000 gallons of volatile organic compounds and 6,000 pounds of metals were estimated to have been disposed of at the Site between 1971 and 1979. Direct exposures to contaminants in the soil, surface water, or air were not considered to be significant because the wastes were buried. However, the contaminants in the soil were determined to have contaminated the groundwater and to have the potential to continue to leach to the groundwater. The contaminated groundwater posed a potential threat to drinking water supplies. The EPA placed the site on the Superfund NPL in 1986.

The EPA issued a Record of Decision in 1989 that selected a remedy for the contaminated soils and groundwater. The remedy consisted of excavation and bioremediation of the VOC-contaminated soil from the two-acre disposal area; stabilization and onsite disposal of the soils containing heavy metals that were not amenable to land treatment; continued recovery of floating free product and pumping and treating the contaminated groundwater. The ROD further required that the site be listed on the State Abandoned and Uncontrolled Sites (currently the Registry of Hazardous Waste or Hazardous Substance Disposal sites).

Soil and groundwater remedial actions began in 1991. The two-acre area disposal area was excavated to a depth of approximately 20 feet. During excavation, approximately 3,500 cubic yards of solid waste material was separated out and disposed of at a sanitary landfill. As well as approximately 220 barrels of paint sludge and liquid solvents, which were disposed of at an EPA permitted disposal facility. Bioremediation treatment of the excavated soils began in October of 1991 and was completed in May of 1999. Approximately 65,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil were treated, removing approximately 71,000 gallons of product. Sampling was performed to confirm cleanup levels had been met. Approximately 2,200 cubic yards of the soil was found to contain lead, which minimally exceeded acceptable levels. These lead-contaminated soils were then stabilized/solidified by adding and mixing agricultural lime to reduce their potential to leach to the groundwater. The treated soils were placed back in the excavated areas and capped with clean soil.

A groundwater pump-and-treat system was constructed and began operating the spring of 1992. As the groundwater treatment activities progressed, it became apparent there was a large volume of floating free product present in the subsurface soils beyond the original disposal area and outside the areas previously excavated.

The remedy was modified in a July 1994 Explanation of Significant Differences document, and again in October 2000. The 1994 ESD primarily addressed increases in scope and cost of the soils and groundwater remedy in the 1989 ROD. The October 2000 ESD addressed those contaminated subsurface soils beyond the original disposal area by modified the remedy to include soil vapor extraction/bioventing, and phytoremediation.

Implementation of the remedial actions in the 2000 ESD began in 2000 with the excavation of an area approximately 200 ft by 500 feet by 35 ft deep. The uncontaminated shallow soils were placed at the bottom of the excavation and the contaminated soils from depth were placed on the top, followed by clean fill. A bioventing system was installed as the contaminated soils were placed back into the excavation. During initial operation of the soil vapor extraction/bioventing system, perched water hindered full-scale operation and the system was instead left in place to allow for ambient bioventing.

Groundwater monitoring of several monitoring wells near or along the southern boundary of the Vogel property demonstrated VOC concentrations increased after the pump-and-treat system was shut down in December of 2004. In 2007, Vogel began a phytoremediation pilot study to evaluate if the technology was effective in preventing further contaminant migration off the property. More than 2,500 poplar and willow trees were planted above the excavated areas of the site. However, the results indicated that phytoremediation was not effective in preventing further contaminant migration in the groundwater and the pilot study was discontinued in 2009.

Further evaluation of additional remedial alternatives at the site is ongoing. A multi-phase pilot study has been underway since 2018 to evaluate the effectiveness of in situ bioremediation technologies to contain the plume. Throughout implementation of the pilot study groundwater samples continue to be collected quarterly or semi-annually from monitoring wells at the site to monitor contaminant concentrations, as well as bioremediation parameters.

The EPA and the IDNR have conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews evaluate whether the remedies protect public health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review in 2024 concluded that the conditions at the site are protective of human health and the environment in the short term. However, additional work needs to be performed for the remedy to be protective in the long term and to prevent contaminated groundwater from migrating off site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Remedial activities at the site continue to be performed by Vogel, with oversight provided by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources as the lead agency, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as the supporting agency.

The EPA and the IDNR have conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews evaluate whether the remedies protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review in 2024 concluded that the conditions at the site are protective of human health and the environment in the short term, in part due to lack of receptors. The Remedial Actions performed to address contaminated soils at the site appear to be functioning as intended. However, to be protective in the long term, monitoring and maintenance of the capped areas needs to be performed. The pump-and-treat remedial action to address contaminated groundwater has not operated at its designed capacity since 2004. Additional work needs to be performed for the remedy to be protective in the long term and to prevent contaminated groundwater from migrating off site. Currently, a Pilot Study is being conducted at the site to evaluate the effectiveness of in situ bioremediation technologies in reducing the concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene in the groundwater.
