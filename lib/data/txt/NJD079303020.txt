### Background

LCP Chemicals, Inc., a division of the Hanlin Group, Inc., purchased the 26-acre chlorine production facility in 1972 from GAF Corporation, which owned and operated the facility since 1942. LCP operated the facility from 1972 through 1985, when it ceased operations. Sludge containing mercury from the chlorine production was discharged to lagoons. In 1972, 1974 and 1979, the State of New Jersey documented releases from the brine sludge lagoon into South Branch Creek.

Over the years, portions of the site and buildings were leased to other companies, including Union Carbide, Microcell Technologies and Kuehne Chemical Company. In July 1991, Hanlin Group, Inc. filed for bankruptcy. Following investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in July 1998.

The 26-acre LCP Chemicals, Inc. site is located in an industrial area on the Tremley Point peninsula next to the Arthur Kill in Linden. The land, originally a coastal marshland, was filled in and developed for industrial use. LCP Chemicals purchased the chlorine production facility in 1972 and operated the facility from 1972 through 1985, when it stopped operations. Sampling of soil, sediment, surface water and ground water revealed elevated levels of mercury, and other contaminants. The site was added to the Superfund list in 1998 and EPA issued a final record of decision (ROD) for the site in 2014.

The ROD requires capping of the site’s contaminated soil to prevent direct contact and to reduce mercury vapor release. The membrane will also prevent contamination from entering the underlying ground water.

EPA’s ROD also requires conversion of the site’s visible mercury to mercuric sulfide if practicable, if not practicable the ROD has a contingency remedy which calls for containing the visible mercury under the site's cap.

Buildings on site will be demolished. Debris will be separated and, if suitable, recycled. The debris that cannot be recycled will be processed to reduce its size and then placed under the cap with other contaminated materials.

In the nearby streams, the most highly contaminated sediment will be dug up and moved upstream where it will be capped. The excavated area and a nearby ditch will be restored with clean sediment, and the wetlands will be reconstructed.

Contaminated ground water from the site will be extracted and treated. A barrier will also be put in place to further limit the potential for contaminated ground water to spread. The ground water will be monitored and deed restrictions will be put in place to restrict its use and other activities that could disturb the containment remedy. Future on-site construction will be restricted to commercial use.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA finished the first phase of the cleanup action in August 2022, which included demolishing the former buildings and structures and consolidating the material beneath a temporary cap. EPA is in the process of starting the second phase of the cleanup action in fall 2024.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

  

The site is surrounded by a tall locked fence to prevent direct human exposure to the site’s contaminated soils. The fencing will remain in place until the remedial actions described in the 2014 ROD are implemented. The site’s air has been sampled to determine if concentrations of mercury vapor are at unacceptable levels during warmer weather events. Results have not shown that to be the case.

The site's remedy is being addressed in two stages.

Phase I of the remedy consist of the demolition of the existing buidlings and structures. The Phase I remedy has started in December 2021 and is expected to last until the summer of 2022. The second phase of the remedy will continue after the first phase has been completed.

### Green Remediation

During the first phase of the cleanup, EPA recycled over 665 metric tons. Additionally over 65,000 kilowatt hours of the sites electricity was purchased from renewable energy sources.
