### Background

The 1.3-acre Beaunit Corp. (Circular Knit & Dyeing Plant) [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located along Valley View Road in northwest Fountain Inn, 15 miles southeast of Greenville. The site includes a former wastewater lagoon where a knitting, dyeing and finishing plant disposed of its wastewater from 1951 to 1977. Residential areas, forested land and commercial businesses border the site to the north. Industrial facilities border the site to the south. Forested land, an industrial facility and residential areas border the site to the east. Valley View Road, forested land and residential areas border the site to the west.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1990, because of contaminated groundwater and soil resulting from waste handling practices. EPA, the [South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC)](https://www.scdhec.gov), and the site’s [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site.

All planned cleanup activities have been completed. The site does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. By monitoring groundwater, placing institutional controls on the site property and undertaking required Five-Year Reviews, EPA, SCDHEC and the site’s PRPs continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**1951 – 1977**  
The knitting, dyeing and finishing plant disposed wastewater from its operations into the lagoon on the site. Wastewater was transported to the lagoon and the wastewater treatment system through a pipeline.

**1977**  
The plant connected to the municipal sewage system and stopped using the lagoon to dispose the wastewater.

**1980**  
In 1980, the responsible parties demolished the wastewater treatment structures and partially filled in the lagoon with demolition debris and soil. Wilson Sporting Goods, a sporting goods manufacturer, also disposed of non-hazardous materials from its operations at the site.

**1990**  
EPA listed the site on the NPL.

**1995**  
EPA issued the cleanup plan for the site. It included grading of the surface of the site; placing a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) solid waste soil-and-clay cap over the lagoon; drainage controls; placing institutional controls on the site property; and monitoring groundwater, surface water and sediment.

**1996 – 1998**  
The PRPs conducted the cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and SCDHEC. Cleanup activities included the following: backfilling the lagoon, covering the lagoon with a clay-and-soil cap, revegetating the cap, grading the surface of the site, and installing a fence and security signs.

**2003**  
The PRPs monitored site ground- and surface waters from 1998 to 2003.

**2003 – 2017**  
The PRPs monitored groundwater, surface water and sediment. Additional groundwater monitoring has been performed, most recently, in September 2017.

**2018**  
The 2018 Five-Year Review was completed and determined that the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.

**2023**

The 2023 Five-Year Review was completed and determined that the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

- The [most recent Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11189540) was published by EPA Headquarters (EPA HQ) 2023**.** The selected remedy currently protects human health and the environment because exposure pathways that could result in an unacceptable risks have been addressed.
- The site’s PRPs continue to monitor groundwater and maintain the capped area.
- Currently, the site is not in use. Fencing and locked gates control access to the site.
- The last groundwater sampling event was in June 2024.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Currently, the site is not in use. Fencing and locked gates control access to the site.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRPs to investigate and clean up the site. The PRPs continue to fund site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
