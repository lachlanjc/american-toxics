### Background

The 18-acre Wasatch Chemical Co. (Lot 6) site is in Salt Lake City, Utah. From 1957 to 1971, Wasatch Chemical Company used the area to warehouse, produce and package industrial chemical products. Between the 1970s and 1992, site operations included blending and packaging pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, industrial chemicals and cleaners. The company also discharged wastewater into on-site tanks, evaporation ponds and onto the ground. These activities contaminated soil, sludge and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The long-term remedy included excavation of contaminated soil and sludge; consolidation of the contaminated soil and sludge in the former evaporation pond; treatment of consolidated soil, sludge and dioxin-removal wastes; excavation and landfarming of hydrocarbon-contaminated soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and institutional controls. Remedy construction took place between 1992 and 1997.

In 2003, groundwater extraction and treatment were discontinued, and groundwater monitoring is ongoing The PRP completed a shallow soil investigation and concluded the soil does not pose an unacceptable risk for a utility worker. Indoor air is also being investigated in three buildings within site boundary.

Site cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions in 1986 included removal of 50 drums, cylinders and other containers of chemical waste and temporary on-site storage of several drums of dioxin-containing waste.
