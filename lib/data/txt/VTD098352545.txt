### Background

The Commerce Street Plume site is located at an industrial park in Williston, Vermont. The property formerly leased by Mitec Systems Corp. (Mitec), one of the known plume contributors, occupies 1 acre at 96 Commerce Street and currently includes one 6,000-square-foot building. Various manufacturing and electroplating operations occurred on the property since 1960. The two primary sources of contamination are an unlined lagoon and a leach field, which were both created to dispose of liquid waste. Plating rinse water and sludge wastes containing heavy metals and solvents were disposed of into the unlined lagoon and the leach field intermittently through 1984. From 1979 to 1986, Mitec leased the property for the manufacturing of electronic and microwave components. Between 1979 and 1984, Mitec discharged an undetermined quantity of rinse waters and sludge wastes containing chromium, cadmium, cyanide, nickel, and industrial solvents associated with electroplating operations into the unlined lagoon. After a Mitec employee expressed concern to the Vermont Agency of Environmental Conservation (VT AEC) in March 1982, the state found the company in violation of hazardous waste regulations for the disposal of chromium-contaminated wastes. Facility operations contaminated soil, sediment, and groundwater with metals and industrial solvents.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The 2022 ESD changed the cleanup levels for soils and the methods to perform the groundwater and vapor intrusion remedies as outlined in the 2015 ROD. The nature and specific basis for these changes, and an explanation of the specific modifications to the ROD, are outlined below.

**A) Soil remedial component, SO-3**

The ROD called for the excavation and off-site disposal of soil in the area of the unlined lagoon at 96 Commerce Street where wastewater was disposed of in the early 1980s. The identified contaminants of concern (COCs) were hexavalent chromium, arsenic, and three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs): benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, and benzo(b)fluoranthene.

From October 17, 2017, to November 3, 2017, EPA excavated 830 cubic yards, totaling approximately 1,193 tons, from four discrete areas in the rear of the parcel, excluding a 12 to 15-foot buffer around a single tree. Excavated soils were disposed of at a licensed off-site facility. Post-excavation confirmatory samples were taken from the bottom and sidewalls of each excavation area. The areas were backfilled and protected over the winter with temporary fencing. Site restoration (plantings, seeding, gravel compaction) and permanent fencing were completed the following field season. All work was performed by approved plans, including all punch list items. On July 16, 2018, EPA approved a Final Site Inspection Memorandum and on September 26, 2018, EPA approved a Final Soil Remedial Action Closure report, dated August 22, 2018. While the performance of the remedy was completed as outlined in the ROD, the cleanup levels for arsenic and use of the cleanup level for hexavalent chromium were changed, as specified in the 2022 ESD.

**B) Groundwater remedial component, GW-5**

The ROD called for pre-design studies (bench-scale and/or pilot tests) to be conducted to determine the specific course of action for In Situ Treatment of the volatile organic compounds in groundwater, including TCE, tetrachloroethene, cis‐1,2‐dichloroethene, and vinyl chloride. Dependent on the results of the pre-design study, the ROD called for the use of In Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO) “and/or” In Situ Bioremediation (ISB) followed by monitored natural attenuation (MNA) after the active remediation portion of the remedial action.

The Proposed Plan summary of the ROD remedy presented a conceptual layout of proposed remedy components where ISCO would be used to treat a hotspot defined by TCE concentrations greater than 50,000 micrograms per liter (μg/l), and ISB would be used to treat concentrations from 500 to 50,000 μg/l using a series of biobarriers. MNA would address concentrations below 500 μg/L as well as the areas between the biobarriers.

In February 2018, EPA completed a pre-design study, which included sampling at existing wells and new boring locations. The pre-design study found that concentrations of TCE, formerly greater than 50,000 μg, had declined to less than 10,000 µg/L. Results of the pre-design study were incorporated into a Basis of Design report, issued in June of 2019, describing the final remedial design. Under the final Remedial Design, ISCO was excluded from the remedial action because it was no longer necessary to address contamination at concentrations greater than 50,000 micrograms per liter (ug/L). ISB alone has been determined to be sufficient to attain the Remedial Action Objectives set in the ROD.

The 2022 ESD eliminates one of the techniques proposed for groundwater treatment in the ROD, In Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO), but retains the other, In Situ Bioremediation (ISB). This ESD does not change the methods cited in the ROD but merely deletes the need for ISCO to be used to treat contaminants.

**C) Vapor Intrusion Remedial Component, VM-3**

The ROD called for further vapor intrusion studies to confirm whether the existing vapor mitigation system that had already been installed at 830 South Brownell Road in 2014 sufficiently protected residents in that home from inhaling potentially harmful vapors emanating from contaminated groundwater. The studies required additional indoor air data to be collected and risk analysis to be performed.

Depending on the results, the ROD called for ICs to require the continued operation of the pre-existing sump pump, passive gas venting, and sump pump discharge system, and to allow for EPA and VTDEC access for inspections, as well as the installation of a sump pump discharge treatment system; or in the alternative, additional vapor mitigation (e.g., active venting, vapor barrier, etc) or other engineering controls to supplement or replace the existing vapor mitigation system.

After the issuance of the ROD, EPA conducted additional sampling from June 22, 2016, to June 23, 2016, and found concentrations of TCE in the basement air, indicating vapor intrusion from underlying contaminated groundwater. On December 5, 2016, EPA completed a human health risk analysis based on the data collected in June 2016, along with the data from previous sampling rounds in April 2014, July 2015, and December 2014. EPA concluded in the risk analysis that TCE exceeded an HQ of 1, thus requiring further vapor intrusion mitigation by the ROD, i.e. further mitigation beyond the existing sump pump system.

After a 2018 Feasibility Study, a design was chosen to: (1) temporarily raise the existing building, (2) partially fill the existing foundation with concrete above the water table to allow for ventilation of “dry” materials beneath the new slab; (3) fill existing concrete block foundation walls with grout to prevent “short-circuiting” of vapors into the building; (4) install a sub-slab depressurization system (SSDS) and vapor barrier; and (5) build an addition to the existing structure to replace lost basement space. The final design was selected based on design components within the Feasibility Study and further feedback from the owner.

As of early 2022, the basement has been partially filled, and the SSDS and vapor barrier are installed, thus mitigating the previous risk. The house addition is nearly complete, with only select construction-related work at the house remaining.

The chosen vapor mitigation measures have eliminated the need to require the continued operation of the previously installed sump pump system, and the need for the installation of a sump water discharge treatment system as called for in the ROD. The implemented measures have also changed the needed scope of institutional controls; no longer will ICs be necessary to require continued operation of these systems. Instead, ICs appropriate to the mitigation measures chosen will be retained and modified.

The 2022 ESD eliminated the requirement for an IC to require the continued operation of the pre-existing sump pump, passive gas venting, and sump pump discharge system, and the requirement for the installation of a sump pump discharge treatment system.

Instead, the remedial component will require a design to: (1) temporarily raise the existing building; (2) partially fill the existing foundation with concrete above the water table to allow for ventilation of “dry” materials beneath the new slab; (3) fill existing concrete block foundation walls with grout to prevent “short-circuiting” of vapors into the building; (4) install a passive sub-slab depressurization system (SSDS) and vapor barrier; and (5) build an addition to the existing structure to replace lost basement space.

In addition, ICs appropriate to the mitigation measures chosen will be retained and modified to provide EPA and VTDEC with access to periodically inspect and maintain the passive SSDS and vapor barrier, and to require the continued function of the passive SSDS system. The IC will also require other appropriate measures, with EPA and/or VTDEC approval, such as a requirement to minimize and/or mitigate risk to human health from vapor intrusion into any new buildings for occupancy at the property; and a prohibition of any renovation, expansion or change in the existing home that might impact the integrity of the vapor barrier or passive SSDS without EPA and/or VTDEC approval.

**The 2015 Record of Decision required:**

Excavation of approximately 630 cubic yards of contaminated soil in the area of the former unlined lagoon at 96 Commerce Street (Lot 07:019:011000) and off-site disposal at a licensed facility, in compliance with all applicable Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and Vermont hazardous waste regulations;
- In situ treatment followed by monitored natural attenuation in those portions of the groundwater plume that are the most highly contaminated and monitored natural attenuation throughout the rest of the groundwater plume;
- Institutional controls such as a municipal ordinance and/or deed restrictions to limit the withdrawal of contaminated groundwater and limit the exposure of persons working in soils saturated with contaminated groundwater, and state reclassification of the groundwater to Vermont Class IV (non-potable) which prohibits the use of groundwater for drinking, until cleanup levels are met;
- Institutional controls were required for the continued operation of the sump pump, passive gas venting, and sump water discharge system already installed at 830 South Brownell Road (Lot 07:003:023000) and to allow access to EPA and the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation (VT DEC) for inspection and maintenance, with the installation of a sump water discharge treatment system (e.g., carbon filters in a shed on site); or additional vapor mitigation (e.g., active venting, vapor barrier, etc) or other engineering controls to supplement or replace the existing vapor mitigation system at 830 South Brownell Road, as determined necessary based on a risk analysis of additional data collected during pre-design; The State of Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation has worked with the owner of a property affected by vapor intrusion to eliminate that exposure pathway and the need for institutional controls. This change will be documented in a pending Explanation of Significant Differences.
- Additional vapor mitigation in other buildings in the vicinity of the plume, if EPA determines at a future time that Site/plume conditions and/or risk and toxicity parameters have changed, and EPA subsequently determines through a vapor intrusion study based on multiple lines of evidence (e.g., groundwater, sub-slab soil gas and/or indoor air data) and risk analysis that a vapor intrusion pathway into a building exists that is a threat to human health. Vapor mitigation measures will include enhancement of any existing sump pump system by adding passive venting (and sump discharge treatment if necessary), or other appropriate measures (e.g., active venting, vapor barrier, or other engineering controls), to be selected in a future decision document, as appropriate. Institutional controls will require continued operation of and access to any enhanced or new vapor mitigation system;
- Long-term groundwater monitoring at the boundaries (Site, institutional control zone, and Class IV, to the extent that they are different) to ensure that the contaminant plume is not migrating; and
- Reviews at least every five years to ensure that the remedy remains protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The excavation and off-site disposal of approximately 830 cubic yards of contaminated soil from the rear of the parcel at 96 Commerce Street were completed from October to November 2017. Site restoration (plantings, seeding, gravel compaction) and permanent fencing were completed in July 2018.

The remedial design for the vapor mitigation remedy at 830 South Brownell Road was completed in September 2018. Construction began in October 2019 and was finished in summer 2021. The Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation is implementing the remedy to credit towards the State's 10% cost share of the fund-lead remedy.

The remedial design for the *in situ* groundwater component of the remedy was completed in June 2019.

EPA is working with the town of Williston to install institutional controls to prevent the use of contaminated groundwater. In 2022,EPA prepared an Explanation of Significant Differences to document the changes in cleanup levels for soils, changes to the amendments proposed to treat contaminated groundwater, and a change to the approach to address vapor intrusion at 830 Brownell Road.

The first five-year review was completed January 31st, 2023. The report can be viewed here: [FIRST FIVE-YEAR REVIEW REPORT](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/100023881)  (33 pp, 10 MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ).
