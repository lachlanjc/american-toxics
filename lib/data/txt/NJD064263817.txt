### Background

The Syncon Resins Superfund site is approximately 15 acres and is located in a heavily industrialized area of northern New Jersey. The site address is 77 Jacobus Avenue in Kearny, Hudson County.

Two waste hauler facilities neighbor the site to the north and south. Jacobus Avenue runs along the eastern side and a former lacquer manufacturing facility sits across the street. The closest residential areas to the site are about one mile west in Newark and one and one-half miles southeast in Jersey City. The site occupies a narrow peninsula of land bordered by the Passaic River and the Hackensack River. The rivers meet about one and one-half miles south of the site and form the upper reaches of Newark Bay.

Most of the former facility's operations consisted of reprocessing resins purchased from other manufacturers. Six main buildings and seven ancillary structures were used in process-related activities on the site. There were at least two chemical reactor buildings that contained stainless steel vessels. Other various buildings and structures filled the site, including numerous large bulk storage tanks, two unlined lagoons used for discharging process wastewater, and an unknown number of underground tanks and associated piping systems.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**Immediate Actions:** The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection removed all the exposed 55-gallon drums from the site between late 1982 to early 1984 and added a fence around the site in early 1990 to provide additional security during cleanup.

**Long-term Cleanup:** EPA divided the site into two operable units (OUs). Operable Units are distinct on-site areas which depend on the complexity of the problems associated with the site. Operable Unit 1 (OU1) includes sitewide groundwater contamination. Operable Unit 2 (OU2) includes soil contamination.

EPA selected a cleanup plan in the site’s [1986 Record of Decision (ROD)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/02/334215). The ROD called for several cleanup activities including removing the contents of the storage tanks and vessels for off-site disposal and decontaminating buildings and tank structures as necessary. It also called for excavating lagoon liquids, sediments, and contaminated surface soil for off-site disposal and installing a cover over the site to allow natural flushing of underlying soil and groundwater contaminants. The ROD also called for collecting and treating contaminated water from the shallow aquifer, to be discharged to the Passaic River. Finally, it called for supplemental studies to evaluate methods to enhance the effectiveness of flushing and or treatment and destruction of contaminated soil.

EPA completed the OU1 cleanup was in October 1993. NJDEP currently operates the groundwater treatment system.

EPA conducted supplemental studies to enhance the existing cleanup system at the site and to address the removal of [total petroleum hydrocarbons](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts123.pdf). EPA selected a [cleanup plan](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/109384.pdf) in September 2010 to excavate and drain contaminated soil, remove buried debris, and install a connecting drainage layer. EPA completed the engineering work needed to carry out the September 2010 plan in October 2012. Funding to start the cleanup became available in August 2015 and EPA began the work in October 2016 after making some necessary revisions of the engineering design work. The construction was completed in October 2018.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) is currently operating and maintaining the groundwater treatment plant, in what is called the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) phase.

EPA conducts five-year reviews (FYR) of the site’s cleanup. This review ensures that cleanup actions protect public health and the environment and function as intended. EPA issued the fifth FYR in September 2021.
