### Background

The 1-acre N.W. Mauthe Co., Inc. site is located in Appleton, Wisconsin. An electroplating facility operated on site from 1960 to 1987, when all usable plating equipment and solutions were removed from the site. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, the site’s remedy is in place. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) is currently the lead agency overseeing the long-term operation and maintenance of the remedy.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Long-term protectiveness requires implementation of institutional controls to prevent access, disturbance of the groundwater collection and treatment system, and installation of drinking water wells.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included building demolition, excavation and off-site treatment of soils contaminated with chromium, capping the site with clay, and installation of groundwater collection trenches and a groundwater treatment facility with discharge to the sanitary sewer system. Construction of the remedy finished in 1998.
