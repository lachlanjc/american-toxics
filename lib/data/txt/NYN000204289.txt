### Background

The Cayuga Groundwater Contamination site includes contaminated groundwater that covers about 4.8 square miles extending from Auburn to Union Springs, New York. It includes the townships of Aurelius, Fleming and Springport. The site contains mostly residential properties mixed with farmland, woodlands and commercial areas. Groundwater at the site is contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including trichloroethylene (TCE), cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride (VC). VOCs are potentially harmful contaminants that easily evaporate in the air. The General Electric Company (GE) owned and manufactured semiconductors at a facility on Genesee Street in Auburn. For a time, Powerex, Inc. a joint venture of GE and others, bought the facility and conducted similar operations there. The Powerex facility is being cleaned up by New York State under its state cleanup program.

The plume extends from the Powerex facility in Auburn to the Village of Union Springs, a distance of approximately seven miles. The plume impacted numerous residential wells which have been connected to public water supplies. The Village of Union Springs municipal drinking water wells have also been impacted by the plume. Groundwater from these wells is treated using an air stripper to remove VOCs prior to distribution.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Following the discovery of contaminated wells, EPA started an emergency response action at the site and began delivery of bottled water to the affected residences in December 2000. VOCs were detected above the federal and/or state drinking water standards in 51 residential wells and three farms with supply wells. EPA installed point-of-entry treatment (POET) systems in homes where wells were contaminated at or above Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) to ensure a safe supply of water, and provided operation and maintenance of these systems. Included in these 54 systems, two large dairy farms had air-stripper treatment systems installed, while the remaining system had carbon adsoprtion units installed. In 2001, the Cayuga County Water Authority extended the public water supply to provide water to affected residences. EPA continues to provide operation and maintenance of the POET systems at the affected farms.

Long-term Cleanup: EPA conducted a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the sources, nature and extent of site contamination and to evaluate remedial alternatives. In 2013 EPA selected a cleanup plan for the groundwater at the site which had been divided into three areas. For Area 1, EPA will use bioremediation, a technique that involves adding chemicals and biological enhancements to the groundwater to promote the breakdown of the VOCs. For Area 2, which contains lower levels of VOCs, EPA will allow natural processes to reduce the level of contamination to meet groundwater standards. For Area 3, the responsible party installed the public water supply modification to the Village of Union Springs water supply. EPA deferred a cleanup plan for the groundwater in Area 3 so that further investigation of groundwater in this area, and potential impacts to surface water could be completed. EPA recently completed the additional investigations, and in 2019 selected a cleanup plan that called for closely monitoring the natural processes causing the decrease in the level of contamination in this area until groundwater standards are met.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in two stages: emergency response actions, including providing treatment systems and an alternate water supply for affected residents, and a long-term remedial phase that focuses on remediating the contaminated groundwater.

Modifications to the Village of Union Springs public water supply have been implemented by the responsible party. A cleanup plan for Area 3 was selected in 2019. Remedial action at the site is scheduled to commence Fall 2022.
