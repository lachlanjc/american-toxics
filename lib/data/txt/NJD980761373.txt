### Background

The DeRewal Chemical Company site is located in Kingwood Township, New Jersey. The site is adjacent to the Delaware River which is used for recreation. Several residences are located near the site. The population of Kingwood Township is approximately 3,900. From 1970 to 1973, the DeRewal Chemical Company used the site for the storage of chemicals. Chemicals handled included a range of metals, acid solutions and fertilizer nutrients and associated compounds. Numerous chemical spills were reported in 1973, including one incident in which the contents of a tank truck containing an acidic chromium solution was allowed to drain onto the soil. The DeRewal Chemical Company ceased operations at the site around 1974.

Site Responsibility: This site is being addressed through Federal and State actions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) soil cleanup has been completed and a groundwater cleanup was also performed. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) has initiated a groundwater monitoring program at the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

A treatment system for the on-site residential well was installed in 1991. After a number of years, the residence became vacant and the well was properly abandoned by a New Jersey-licensed driller. This involved pumping a cement grout through a tremie line from the bottom of the well to ground surface. A cultural resources mitigation action in November and December 1996 resulted in the recovery of more than 3,000 Native American artifacts, many dating back more than 1,000 years. EPA worked cooperatively with Kingwood Township and transferred all of the artifacts to the locality.

Soil cleanup started in July 1997 and was finished in July 1998. About 60,000 tons of contaminated soil were excavated and disposed of off site. Restoration activities have also been completed. The State obtained a conservation easement dated January 31, 2002, which incorporated portions of the site into the Delaware River Greenway. In addition, the State purchased a portion of the site in November 2002. Construction of the system to address contaminated shallow groundwater started in July 2003 and finished in September 2003.

EPA has conducted five five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place continue to protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review, in 2022, concluded that the remedy is protective of human health and the environment. Groundwater monitoring will continue by the NJDEP.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in two remedial phases focused on cleanup of contaminated soils and shallow groundwater.

Entire Site: Based on studies of the contamination at the site, EPA selected a remedy that included: (1) excavation of contaminated soil; (2) on-site thermal treatment of organic-contaminated soil; (3) on-site solidification and stabilization of the thermally treated soil and the inorganic-contaminated soil; (4) extraction of shallow contaminated groundwater with off-site disposal at an approved industrial wastewater treatment facility; (5) provision of a treatment system for the on-site residential well; and (6) monitoring to ensure the effectiveness of the remedy.

In December 1994, after reviewing additional data gathered during the design process, and presenting its findings to the public, EPA changed the remedy for soil contaminated with organic compounds from on-site to off-site thermal treatment. Similarly, in June 1997, EPA changed the remedy for soil contaminated with inorganic compounds to off-site treatment and disposal. Chromium-contaminated soil located below the water table was also not excavated since it was determined to not act as a source of groundwater contamination.

Operation of the groundwater remediation system has been suspended by NJDEP as they believe that operation of the treatment system is not warranted given the current contaminant concentrations in the groundwater. In addition, no human or ecological receptors have been identified for the groundwater underlying the site. NJDEP has initiated a groundwater monitoring program at the site and conducts sampling of the monitoring wells at a rate of approximately once per year.
