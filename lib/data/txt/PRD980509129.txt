### Background

T he 20-acre Barceloneta Landfill site is an inactive landfill in Florida Afuera, Puerto Rico. About 300 tons of hazardous wastes are located in the three sinkholes that make up the landfill. There are no barriers to keep wastes from moving into the groundwater; the limestone formations underlying the area could allow contaminants to move rapidly. Drinking water comes from groundwater in the area. People also use it for irrigation. No contamination has been found off site. The surrounding area is commercial, residential, and agricultural. Approximately 12,000 people live *within a* 3-mile radius of the site, and the nearest home is about 500 feet away. Area residents used the site for scavenging and for driving all-terrain vehicles. People swim and fish in Quebrada Cimarrona, a stream located on the site. EPA cleaned up the site by capping the disposal areas with a cover system in 2000. Long-term monitoring of the remedy is ongoing. Under current conditions, potential or actual human exposures are under control.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1988, EPA began an intensive study of pollution problems at the site. This investigation finished in 1995. Groundwater sampling identified various heavy metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). EPA cleaned up the site by capping the disposal areas with a cover system in 2000. Long-term monitoring of the remedy is ongoing. Under current conditions, potential or actual human exposures are under control. In 1988, an additional search for PRPs identified several parties that have used the landfill.

On September 28, 1990, an Administrative Order on Consent was signed by eight industries, a transporter, the municipality of Barceloneta, and EPA, in which the parties agreed to complete the site investigation. The Remedial Investigation was completed in May 1995 and the Feasibility Study submitted in October 1995.

EPA issued a Proposed Plan on December 27, 1995 which described a preferred alternative for capping the landfill and held a public meeting on January 18, 1996 to describe the preferred alternative and answer questions. The public comment period closed on January 26, 1996. The Record of Decision (ROD) was signed July 6, 1996. The selected remedy required the capping of the three disposal areas by installing a low permeability cover system meeting the requirements of the RCRA subtitle D and Commonwealth of Puerto Rico regulations for landfill closure. EPA required the coordinated closure and remediation of all areas of the Site. A Consent Decree (CD) for Remedial Design and Remedial Action of the remedy selected in the ROD was signed on September 30, 1997. The CD for implementation of EPA’s selected remedy pursuant to the ROD was lodged by DOJ on January 8, 1998 with ten Settling Defendants.

The Remedial Design Report was approved by EPA on September 17, 1999. Also, EPA approved early Remedial Actions that were carried-out before the approval of the final Remedial Design Report. These actions included the excavation and stockpiling of clay; and excavation and relocation of waste from latest discovered waste area. These activities were started on September 7, 1999. The Remedial Action Wok Plan to implement the ROD, submitted by the Settling Defendants was approved on December 16,1999. The on-site construction started in January 24, 2000 and it was completed on the August 31, 2000.

On September 27, 2000, EPA signed the Preliminary Site Close Out Report. The assessment of this five-year review was conducted in August 2005 and found that the remedy was constructed in accordance with the requirements of the Record of Decision (ROD). This five year review found that the remedy is functioning as designed. The immediate threats have been addressed and the remedy is protective in the short-term, however, in order for the remedy to be protective in the long-term, follow-up actions, namely implementing final institutional controls, need to be taken. Currently is being conducted the second five-year review. The Municipality of Barceloneta owns most of the property. The property is under a Consent Decree and has identified the property boundaries. They completed the acquisition process for these properties, for implementing final institutional controls.

The 1st five-year review report was signed on August 11, 2005. The assessment of this five-year review found that the remedy was constructed in accordance with the requirements of the Record of Decision (ROD). This five-year review found that the remedy is functioning as designed. The immediate threats have been addressed and the remedy is protective in the short-term. Also, in order for the remedy to be protective in the long-term, final institutional controls (deed restrictions), are being implemented by the PRP’s.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

This site is being addressed in a single long-term remedial phase focusing on cleanup of the entire site. The remedy for the Barceloneta Landfill Superfund Site is protective in the short-term, however, in order for the remedy to be protective in the long-term, follow-up actions, namely implementing final institutional controls, need to be taken.

In 1988, EPA began an intensive study of pollution problems at the site. This investigation was completed in 1995. The remedies for the site consist of capping of the landfill, institutional controls, and groundwater monitored. The site achieved construction completion with the signing of the Preliminary Close Out Report on September 27, 2000.

Currently, there are no environmental exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks and none expected as long as the engineered controls selected in the decision documents continue to be properly operated, monitored, and maintained.

The Operation & Maintenance, and Post Remediation Monitoring Manual dated March 2000, and approved on February 26, 2001 is being implemented and include a 30-year Groundwater wells monitoring program.
