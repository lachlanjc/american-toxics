### Background

**Current Status**

On September 19, 2016, EPA signed the Record of Decision (ROD) Amendment for the American Creosote Works Inc. site. The ROD Amendment identifies the revised remedy which changes the method to address the source contaminants prescribed in the original 1993 remedy. EPA completed development of a Remedial Design which describes the plans necessary to implement and has begun implementing the revised remedy.

**Site Background**

The 34-acre American Creosote Works, Inc. (Winnfield Plant) site is located in Winnfield, Louisiana. Wood treatment took place on site from 1901 to 1979. The treatment process used creosote and pentachlorophenol (PCP). After the site owner, Dickerson Lumber Company, declared bankruptcy, Stallworth Timber Company purchased the property and wood treatment operations resumed in 1981, only to abandon the site in 1985. Spills and treatment process upsets contaminated soil and ground water. Remediaion at the site has been on-going since 1994.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.  
  
Cleanup activities supported local employment by using local labor. The primary cleanup contractor also used several local vendors. The in-place bioremediation treatment system has effectively eliminated discharges to Creosote Branch Creek, allowing the stream to recover to natural conditions.  
  
EPA is working with the City of Winnfield to support the site’s industrial reuse. The City of Winnfield and Winn Parish are constructing a joint fire training facility on the site.

The American Creosote Works (ACW) Superfund Site is located in Winnfield, Winn Parish, Louisiana. The ACW Site is about 34 acres in size, and it is bordered by Front Street on the west and Watts and Grove Streets on the south. The Site is bounded on the north and east by Creosote Branch creek.  
  
Wood treatment operations at the ACW Site began in 1901, when the Site was operated by the Bodcaw Lumber Company. In 1938, the ACW Site was purchased by American Creosote Works of Louisiana, Inc. (later to become American Creosote Works, Inc.), which operated the facility until 1977. Wood treatment operations at the Site utilized both creosote and pentachlorophenol (PCP). Petroleum products were also used as a carrier fluid for the creosote and PCP. By 1979, it appears that wood treating operations at the ACW Site had ceased.The site owner, Dickerson Lumber Company, declared bankruptcy during this time period, and the City of Winnfield seized the property for failure to pay taxes. The Site was eventually purchased by Stallworth Timber Company, and by 1981, wood treating operations resumed at the Site on a smaller scale.  
  
The LDEQ conducted several inspections at the Site between 1982 and 1986. These inspections noted spillage of creosote, abandoned pits and containers, and obvious offsite contamination. LDEQ issued a letter of warning to Stallworth Timber Company in January 1983. In December 1984, LDEQ inspectors noted no improvements at the Site, and issued a Compliance Order. Stallworth Timber Company failed to comply with the terms of the Compliance Order, and in June 1985, LDEQ inspectors found the Site abandoned. The LDEQ referred the ACW Site to EPA in March 1987.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The long-term remedy included pumping of liquid contamination from the subsurface; separation, treatment and disposal of liquid contamination; on-site incineration of contaminated tar and sludge; use of incinerator ash as backfill material; and grading, capping and revegetation of backfilled areas. It also included using in-place biological treatment for contaminated soil and sludge, capping of contaminated surface soil, decontamination and on-site landfilling of process equipment and scrap, grading and capping, ecological monitoring, and ground water monitoring. In-situ biological treatment of contaminated soil and the pumping and treatment of liquid contaminants have been on-going since 1996.  
  
Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions in 1988 included draining an on-site tank, constructing a berm around the process area to contain and stabilize heavily contaminated soil, and installing an overflow filtration system. Removal actions in 1989 consolidated all wood-treating liquids, solidified liquid and surface sludge, placed stabilized material in an existing impoundment, dismantled and decontaminated existing buildings and process equipment, constructed a drainage ditch, and treated and discharged contaminated water to Creosote Branch Creek.

  
On September 19, 2016, EPA signed the Record of Decision (ROD) Amendment for the American Creosote Works Inc. site. The ROD Amendment identifies the revised remedy which changes the method to address the source contaminants prescribed in the original 1993 remedy.

The revised remedy for the ACW Site consists of the following elements:

● Excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soils located in the eastern and northern portions of the site.

● Excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated areas along the northern and western fence line near Creosote Branch Creek. The creek excavation areas will be replaced with clean fill and constructed to maintain creek bank integrity.

● In-situ solidification /stabilization of NAPL contaminated soils and groundwater.

● Abandonment and decommissioning of the groundwater treatment system associated with the 1993 remedy.

● Placement of soil cover to protect the solidification treatment area.

● Institutional Controls will be placed to aid in the protection from the waste left on-site.

● Groundwater at the site will be monitored and a decision concerning any necessary remedial action for the groundwater will be made in the future after the effectiveness of the revised remedy can be determined.

EPA has completed the Remedial Design which develops the plans necessary to implement the 2016 revised remedy.

EPA is preparing plans to initiate the 2016 revised remedy based on receipt of funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
