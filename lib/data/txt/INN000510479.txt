Background
T﻿he Kokomo Groundwater Plume in Kokomo, Indiana consists of a groundwater plume contaminated with chlorinated solvents, especially vinyl chloride, and arsenic. Chlorinated solvents are a manufactured chemical widely used for dry cleaning of fabrics and as a solvent used to clean machinery and electronic parts. The groundwater plume has impacted several of the city of Kokomo’s municipal wells which provides water to approximately 55,000 residents. From 2007 through 2010, the Indiana American Water Company, which operates the groundwater wells and treatment plant, detected chlorinated solvents in the untreated water supply during routine testing. Due to the detections of chlorinated solvents in the raw water, IDEM’s Site Investigation Program referred the site to EPA for further investigation. The federal agency conducted additional sampling at the site and found unsafe levels of chlorinated solvents and aresenic. The city of Kokomo has installed a filtering system to remove contaminates from the water supply before reaching residents. Top of Page

In 2016, EPA added the Kokomo Groundwater Plume Site to the National Priorities List. The NPL is the list of hazardous waste sites in the United States that are eligible for long-term remedial action and federal funding under the Superfund law. The Superfund law is what gives EPA the authority to clean up releases of hazardous substances. Top of Page
