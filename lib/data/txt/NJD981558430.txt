### Background

The Atlantic Resources site is a 4.5-acre property located in Sayreville, New Jersey, near the Raritan River. The Atlantic Resources Corporation facility was a precious metals recovery operation. Gold and silver were recovered by incineration and smelting, or acid etching, from fly ash, x-ray and photographic film, circuit boards, building material and other waste materials. Waste solvents were also accepted for use as fuel in the incinerators. The Atlantic Resources Corporation owned and operated the facility from 1972 until it filed for bankruptcy in 1985. The Atlantic Resource site first came to EPA’s attention in 1981, when a brush fire at the adjoining Horseshoe Road site exposed approximately 70 partially filled drums containing acetonitrile, silver cyanide and ethyl acetate. The Atlantic Resources site is being addressed with the neighboring Horseshoe Road site due to their close proximity and intermixing of contaminant plumes. The Horseshoe Road site contained several buildings that were used to process epoxy resins, epoxy pigments and roofing materials as well as other products.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In March 1987, EPA addressed immediate threats to human health and the environment posed by the site. EPA removed acids from leaking vats, cleaned up mercury spills and disposed of 152 drums of hazardous substances, 5,550 gallons of combustible liquids, 70 pounds of mercury, 520 cubic yards of contaminated debris and 15 gas cylinders. In 1996 and 1999, EPA posted warning signs and removed surface debris and ash contaminated with dioxin and metals.

In July 1997, EPA started a remedial investigation to determine the nature and extent of remaining contamination. EPA found that building demolition was a necessary first step; the site’s potentially responsible party group completed demolition of all structures on the Atlantic Resources site in May 2003.

In 2014 EPA,working with the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs), implemented a remedy to remove aproximately 120,000 tons of for contaminated surface soil and deeper soils that acted as source material for groundwater contamination.

The EPA implemented a sediment remedy that included hydraulic dredging of contaminated sediments in the Raritan River and capping of the dredged area. The remedy also called for mechanical dredging a marsh adjoining the Raritan River. The dredging project began in the summer of 2015 and the restoration of the marsh and river was completed in November 2017. Due to acid conditions in the soil, plantings in the upper marsh did not succeed and an application of lime was conducted in January of 2020. The upper marsh was replanted in June 2020. After a final inspection in April 2021 the marsh and river restoration was considered complete.

EPA continues to monitor the groundwater to ensure levels do not increase.
