### Background

The 71-acre Portland Cement site is located in Salt Lake City, Utah. Between 1963 and 1983, about 500,000 cubic yards of cement kiln dust (CKD) were collected from the Portland Cement Plant in Salt Lake City and deposited as fill material at the site. CKD contains several heavy metals, including arsenic, lead, chromium, cadmium and molybdenum. Additional waste disposal activities at the site included disposal of a few hundred tons of chromium-bearing bricks. These activities contaminated soil, air and groundwater with heavy metals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state and federal actions.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires implementation of the correct analytical methods for the site and submittal of semi-annual sampling reports in a timely manner.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included excavation and off-site disposal of CKD; removal, treatment and off-site disposal of all chromium-bearing refractory kiln brick; and groundwater monitoring. Cleanup also included excavation and solidification of lead-contaminated soil; installation of clean fill over the site; reuse of non-hazardous debris as fill material; natural attenuation of groundwater contaminants; and institutional controls. Remedy construction took place between 1995 and 1998. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing.
