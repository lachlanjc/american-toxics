### Background

The West County Road 112 Ground Water site is a plume of groundwater contaminated with chromium and hexavalent chromium in Midland County, Texas, immediately southwest of the city of Midland. The groundwater plume is about two miles in length. Investigations have not found the source of groundwater contamination. Monitoring and investigations are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

Without identification and investigation of the source of groundwater contamination and remediation of the contaminated groundwater plume, remaining public supply and private wells will be contaminated. Other federal and state cleanup programs were evaluated but are not viable options for the site.

The center of the site is designated as 2601 West County Road 112, Midland, Texas. The total length of the chromium plume exceeding the 100 micrograms per liter drinking water standard for chromium is about one and a quarter miles. Chromium concentrations in groundwater exceeding 10 micrograms per liter have been detected across an area about two miles in length. The groundwater data represents the chromium concentrations in the Ogallala aquifer or upper water-bearing sands beneath the site. The site was identified in April 2009 by a local resident who asked TCEQ to test their private well due to yellow discoloration. TCEQ has installed water filtration systems at homes where total chromium has been detected above the 100 micrograms per liter drinking water standard.The center of the site is designated as 2601 West County Road 112, Midland, Texas.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) identified groundwater contamination in a private well in 2009 following a request by a local resident for sampling due to yellow discoloration. TCEQ installed water filtration systems at homes where contamination is above the drinking water standard. Installation of groundwater monitoring wells as well as groundwater sampling took place in 2011 and 2012.

Initial sampling of residential yard soil in 2013 determined that contamination is accumulating in soil from use of contaminated groundwater for irrigating yards and gardens at private residences. Development of plans for data collection and cleanup options for groundwater are ongoing. Groundwater sampling also took place in 2013.

EPA will select the siteâ€™s long-term remedy following completion of the remedial investigation/feasibility study.
