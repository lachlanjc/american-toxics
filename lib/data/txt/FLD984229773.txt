### Background

The 9-acre Normandy Park Apartments site is located at 11110 North 56th Street in a commercial area of Temple Terrace, Florida, approximately five miles northwest of Tampa. The site includes the area where Gulf Coast Recycling operated a battery recycling and secondary lead extraction facility between 1953 and 1963. The company built a 144-unit apartment complex on the property in 1970. The apartment complex, complete with a playground, an apartment clubhouse, and a laundry facility, continues to operate as a residential property. The northern courtyard consists of 80 residential units in eight buildings. The southern courtyard consists of 64 residential units in four buildings. Residents, including children, continue to live in the complex. Apartment structures, swimming pools, tennis courts, paved parking and roadways cover most of the site. Grass, mulch or tree plazas cover remaining areas of the Site.

At the facility, Gold Coast Recycling chopped off or cracked open the tops of used lead batteries. The PRP separated and processed lead plates for recycling and disposed of battery casings, then used intensive heat to extract lead from the lead plates. The process resulted in the release of sulfuric acid and lead into the environment.

The EPA’s sampling in the early 1990s confirmed widespread lead contamination throughout the Site. The EPA proposed the Site for listing on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1995. EPA decided not to list the site on the NPL following extensive cooperation from Gulf Coast Recycling.

The EPA, the [Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP)](https://floridadep.gov/) and the Site’s [potentially responsible party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) – formerly Gulf Coast Recycling and now Envirofocus, have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination.

The [2021 Five-Year Review (FYR)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11166213.pdf) determined that the site is currently protective of human health and the environment. The current FYR was signed on August 10, 2021 with a determination that the site is currently protective and will be updated to the website shortly.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Envirofocus acquired Gulf Coast Recycling, Inc. and is now responsible for operation and maintenance activities at the Site. The EPA and the Florida Department for Environmental Protection provide oversight.

**1990s**  
The EPA’s sampling in the early 1990s confirmed widespread lead contamination throughout the Site. To address immediate concerns, the site PRP placed two concrete caps over contaminated soil in the northern portion of the apartment complex in 1992 and built a wooden deck over contaminated soil in the complex’s southern courtyard in 1995.

**2000**  
The EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) cleanup plan for the Site. The plan included:

- excavating the top two feet of exposed soil around the entire apartment complex
- removing the wooden deck in the southern courtyard and digging up soil in the area down to the groundwater table
- placing clean dirt and sod in all excavated areas
- screening and treating excavated soil in the open field behind the apartment complex as needed, depending upon soil screening results
- monitoring the natural attenuation of groundwater contaminants
- putting institutional controls in place to limit the future use of soil and groundwater

**2001**  
The PRP began additional cleanup activities at the site soon after the EPA issued the ROD and completed the majority of the work in 2001. The PRP:

- dug up soil around the apartment complex to a depth of two feet
- replaced the soil with clean dirt and planted sod at ground level
- tested and treated excavated soil as necessary and sent the soil to an appropriate off-site disposal facility
- placed tree plazas and thick mulch around the trees on site

After completing soil cleanup activities, the PRPs have monitored the natural attenuation of groundwater contaminants and conduct regular sampling twice annually.

**2016**  
Institutional controls or other land use control documents may also need to be revised to restrict disturbance of soil below two feet where some contamination may remain, to ensure protectiveness. The 2016 FYR determined that the site is currently protective but additional off-site sampling was required to further delineate the antimony plume.

The EPA obtained access to neighboring properties which require soil and groundwater sampling to evaluate whether there is an off-site source of antimony. The current results from this sampling effort do not indicate an off-site source.

Additional groundwater sampling may be needed to further delineate the antimony groundwater plume if sampling in the ROW continues to show concentrations above ROC cleanup levels.

**2017**  
The EPA was notified in July 2017 that the southern-most building of the apartment complex had caught on fire. The damage was extensive, and the structural determination required slab removal. The site owner coordinated with the PRP group so that when the slab was removed the PRPs could sample soil and determine what needed to be removed The property owner also decided to demolish the retired pool and patio that covered the area in the courtyard beside the demolished building to allow the PRP group to execute further source soil material removal. The PRPs completed the additional sampling and soil removal under the demolished building and in the courtyard where the former source area was located under the retired pool in September 2017.

In order to avoid the need for continuing maintenance of the tree plazas, the PRP proposed removing the tree plaza cover materials (i.e. pavers and wood decking) and to remove soil from each tree plaza vertically to a depth of at least two feet below ground surface (bgs). The tree plaza constructed around the tree located on the east side of the pool in the southern apartment complex was removed, along with the tree and contaminated soil, after the demolition of the pool area in November 2017.

**2018**  
An excavation plan which included a summary of the additional soil sampling conducted at Tree Plaza D and Tree Plaza E was sent to the EPA and FDEP on July 2, 2018. The excavation plan was approved on July 27, 2018.

From October through November 2018 soil excavation activities at the Normandy Park apartments took place, and are summarized as follows:

- Soil excavation was conducted at each tree plaza on Site.
- A total of approximately 79.9 tons of impacted soil was excavated and disposed. All of the soil was treated per the ROD before being disposed at a Class I landfill.

All of the contaminated soil, which exceeded the residential exposure limit of 440 mg/kg, has now been removed from the former tree plaza areas. That means that all of the contaminated soil which is not covered by a permanent structure (i.e. building, asphalt parking area, concrete sidewalks), has been removed from the Site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [2021 Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11166213.pdf) was published by the EPA HQs in 2021. The remedy at the site is currently protective of human health and the environment because there are no completed exposure pathways.

This Site is in Long-term Operations and Maintenance by the PRP until the contaminants in the groundwater drop below the clean-up levels, Maximum Contaminant Level (MCLs), established in the ROD. There are no completed exposure pathways, however there are contaminants in the soil under structures. Periodic groundwater sampling in accordance with the approved monitored natural attenuation sampling plan will continue until the groundwater clean-up levels specified in the ROD are achieved.

Once the Site has met the ROD cleanup goals, EPA will de-propose the Site from the NPL as it was proposed but never listed.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls are currently in place to limit the future use of soil and groundwater.

A restrictive covenant placed on the property requires the submittal of plans to the EPA and FDEP and approval by both agencies before the property owner can remove paved areas or buildings. All plans must include measures to address soil contamination underneath the buildings and paved areas.

The Southwest Florida Water Management District has listed the Site as a groundwater delineation area, which means all wells placed in the area require the District’s approval.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Periodic groundwater sampling of lead and antimony will continue twice per year until groundwater contamination levels meet clean-up goals.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, the EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

In 1992, Gulf Coast Recycling entered into an Administrative Order of Consent (AOC) with the EPA to abate the immediate threat of exposure to apartment residents. In 1992, Gulf Coast Recycling entered into an AOC with the EPA to conduct a Streamlined Remedial Investigation (SRI), Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) and Risk Assessment at the site. A 2001 Consent Decree was signed between the EPA and Gulf Coast Recycling to address cleanup activities under the ROD at the Site.
