### Background

The Dublin TCE Superfund Site is located in Dublin Borough, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. In 1986, the Bucks County Health Department discovered trichloroethylene (TCE), a chemical component of solvents, in 23 home tap water samples in Dublin. The highest TCE concentrations were found in a well on the site property. This property has been the site of several manufacturing operations over the last 50 years, including Kollsman Motor Company, which allegedly used and disposed of solvents, including TCE, on the property during its operation. This property is thought to be the likely source of the TCE groundwater contamination. The groundwater was used by private wells servicing approximately 100 homes, apartments, and businesses in Dublin. All the affected wells have been taken out of service and drinking water is being provided by the public system. The site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List in August 1990.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1987, EPA and the current site owner entered into a consent order and agreement that identified wells affected by TCE contamination. The site owner installed carbon treatment systems on some contaminated wells and/or has provided bottled water for the residence or business owners. In 1991, EPA required the extension of the Dublin Borough public water supply system to affected and potentially affected residences and businesses, and required the construction of a new water supply well and treatment system. EPA completed construction of the residential water line in 1995, and in 1996, extended the water line into neighboring Hilltown Township to provide water to homes potentially affected by site contamination.

In 1992, a Feasibility Study began to explore cleanup alternatives for the site. In September 2002, EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD), selecting in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) as the groundwater cleanup remedy. The ROD stated that if the ISCO remedy failed to achieve clean-up goals within a reasonable timeframe, a contingent remedy to extract and treat the contaminated groundwater would be implemented. In August 2015, EPA issued an Explanation of Significant Differences to trigger implementation of the contingent ‘pump and treat’ remedy specified in the 2002 ROD. EPA is currently working with the responsible party and Dublin Borough to design and implement this contingent remedy.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is currently working with the responsible party and Dublin Borough to design and implement a contingent remedy to address the groundwater contamination. The next five-year review will follow completion of the contingent remedial action.

In addition, EPA and the responsible party are also working together to investigate the vapor intrusion pathway. The responsible party collected samples from approximately 20 homes and business in March 2014, March 2015 and December 2016. No risk from vapor intrusion was identified in the residential area. Vapor intrusion sampling at the onsite structure has indicated that, while elevated concentrations of VOCs existed in the sub-slab, there was no risk to human health associated with it.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls permanently limit the 120 Mill Street property to commercial/industrial use with no residential use in the future. Groundwater use is prohibited.
