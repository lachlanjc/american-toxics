Background
The Collins & Aikman Plant (former) Superfund Site (the Site) is comprised of the former Collins & Aikman facility and property, located on two parcels south of NH Route 11 in Farmington, NH: (i) a 96-acre parcel on Davidson Drive; and (ii) a 10-acre parcel located at 56 Davidson Drive (collectively, the Property). The Site also extends into and includes an approximate 152-acre area north of NH Route 11 affected by Site-related contamination, including a groundwater plume. The affected area north of NH Route 11 is roughly bounded by NH Route 11, Pokamoonshine Brook to the north/northwest, and the boundaries of several properties containing the plume to the east.  Most of the 106-acre Property consists of undeveloped wooded areas and contains the concrete foundation/floor of the former 267,000 square foot (ft2) (6.1 acres) manufacturing building, which was demolished in 2010, and the surrounding paved parking areas and driveways for the building. The former actively used area of the Property reportedly occupied approximately 33 acres, and included the manufacturing building, a 60,000-ft2 warehouse, and paved areas.  From 1966 to 2006, operations included the manufacture of instrumentation panel pads bumpers, fascias, and other parts for automobiles and trucks. Manufacturing processes conducted at the facility included polyurethane foam molding, construction of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) shells, and the assembly of the finished panels. Painting operations were also conducted at the facility. The manufacturing processes involved the use of solvents, some of which were released to groundwater, soil, and surface water at the facility. Solvents used at the facility reportedly included: acetone, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), methylene chloride, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), tetrachloroethene (PCE), toluene, trichloroethene (TCE), and xylene.  The Site has been the subject of numerous investigations and remedial activities since 1983 when low concentrations of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) were detected in a Town of Farmington municipal drinking water supply well located approximately 3,500 feet northeast and downgradient of the former manufacturing facility. In December 2013, EPA added the Site to the National Priorities List (NPL). 

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The Collins & Aikman Plant (former) Superfund Site was listed on the EPA's National Priorities List (NPL) in 2013 and is being addressed through federal actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Between 2014 and 2024, EPA conducted a Remedial Investigation (RI) and Feasibility Study (FS) of the Site. In the RI, EPA investigated the nature and extent of contamination at the Site and assessed the extent of risk to human health and the environment. The RI concluded that there was an unacceptable risk to human health from contaminants in soil and groundwater at the Site. In the FS, EPA analyzed remedial options to address the contamination.  EPA was the lead agency for performing the RI/FS and for selecting the remedy for the Site. EPA has entered into a cooperative agreement with the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES), which contracted with Sanborn, Head & Associates, Inc. to conduct site investigation activities and to evaluate alternatives for remediation. 
What Is the Current Site Status?
Between 2014 and 2024, a comprehensive Remedial Investigation (RI) was conducted by EPA in order to characterize the nature and extent of contamination and assess the extent of risk to human health and the environment. As part of the RI, human health and ecological risk assessments were performed.  From 2021 to 2024, a Feasibility Study (FS) was conducted to evaluate various remedial options for the Site. On June 27, 2024, EPA issued a Proposed Plan outlining its proposed remedy for the Site and invited the public to provide comments on the Proposed Plan from July 1, 2024 through August 30, 2024.   On July 16, 2024, EPA held an informational meeting Exitand presented the Proposed Plan to the public. The informational meeting was immediately followed by a hearing to allow the public to provide verbal comments on the Proposed Plan. EPA will review verbal comments received during the hearing, and all written comments received during the formal comment period, before making a final cleanup decision. Formal comments made during the hearing or submitted in writing during the comment period will become part of the official public Administrative Record for EPA’s cleanup plan decision. EPA will prepare a Responsiveness Summary of significant comments, criticisms, and new relevant information submitted during the public comment period and EPA’s responses to each issue. The Responsiveness Summary will be issued with EPA’s decision document, referred to as the Record of Decision, specifying EPA’s selected cleanup plan. After completion, the Record of Decision, Responsiveness Summary and Administrative Record will be made available to the public on EPA’s website. 
Sampling and Monitoring
The investigation activities that have been conducted include extensive soil, groundwater, sediment and surface water sampling to characterize the nature and extent of contamination at the Collins & Aikman Plant (former) Superfund Site. Evaluation and monitoring of nearby water supply wells has also been conducted to ensure that there is no one who is impacted by contamination in groundwater. Hundreds of soil, groundwater, sediment and surface water samples have been collected and analyzed to help determine the potential for risk to human health and the environment and sampling will continue during implementation of a remedial action to evaluate the effectiveness of the remedy.
