### Background

The 800-acre Reynolds Metals Company (RMC) site is located in Troutdale, Oregon. It is the former location of the Reynolds/Alcoa aluminum smelter, which operated an aluminum reduction plant from 1941 until 2000. Large quantities of wastes were generated by the plant during the production of aluminum, resulting in contamination of soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment with heavy metals and organic chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

Reynolds ceased operations in 2000. The facility was purchased by ALCOA. The Port of Portland bought the site in 2004, and started redevelopment. The site is now the Troutdale Reynolds Industrial Park. Alcoa remains as the site potentially responsible party (PRP) and is liable for site cleanup activities.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through potentially responsible parties (PRP) actions. EPA is the lead agency at the site, with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) providing support.

EPA completed the third Five-Year Review of the site’s remedy in 2018. It found that the remedy is protective of human health and the environment in the short term. A Site Optimization report was completed in September 2018. The conceptual site model (CSM) is being updated and a groundwater model is being developed to determine the most effective groundwater pumping in order to meet flouride cleanup standards.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 2006, EPA issued the long-term cleanup plan for the site. It included institutional controls, continued operation of the groundwater focused extraction/production well optimization system; maintenance and monitoring of capped areas; and monitoring of groundwater.

**Cleanup Progress**

EPA issued a cleanup plan in 2002 to conduct interim remedial actions at the site. It included removing contaminated process residue from Company Lake; excavating contaminated waste and soil from the south landfill area and eastern portion of the north landfill area for off-site disposal; installing a soil-and-rock cover over the western portion of the landfill; installing extraction wells in the east potliner and scrap yard areas; modifying the operation of existing production wells; and discharging groundwater from the production wells and extraction system to the Columbia River. The interim plan also included monitoring groundwater and implementing engineering and institutional controls.

In 2005, RMC completed the soil cleanup portion of the interim remedy and constructed the combined production wells/focused extraction system.

**2018 Howard Orlean Excellence in Site Reuse Award**  
Each year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognizes the remarkable community-wide efforts that return Superfund sites to productive and beneficial use. In 2018 the Port of Portland was presented with EPA Region 10’s Howard Orlean Excellence in Site Reuse Award in recognition of its efforts as part of a diverse group of stakeholders who have made possible the redevelopment of the Reynolds Metals Company Superfund site.

The project was designed to be compatible with EPA’s selected remedy and resulted in the development of a valuable community resource. Through stakeholder negotiations, collaboration and innovative planning, project partners have transformed this once heavily-contaminated aluminum smelter into a remarkable facility. Today, Troutdale Reynolds Industrial Park fosters local economic growth while also sustaining the area’s natural resources. From the outset, project partners recognized the site’s redevelopment potential. They were also interested in making sure it provided a range of community benefits. Project partners focused on opportunities for a mix of industrial, ecological and recreational uses on site. A series of innovative agreements and procedures enabled site redevelopment to move forward.

Today, Troutdale Reynolds Industrial Park is a major community asset that attracts companies and workers to the region. FedEx Ground’s $200 million regional distribution center employs more than 800 people. The park’s $178.4 million Amazon fulfilment center will provide up to 1,500 jobs. The Port of Portland has also set aside areas for infrastructure, open space, wetlands and trails. Finally, in addition to providing thousands of jobs and employment income, Troutdale Reynolds Industrial Park generates significant tax revenues for the City of Troutdale and Multnomah County.

EPA supports the redevelopment of contaminated properties and views the revitalization of communities affected by contaminated properties as a key component of its mission to protect human health and the environment. Region 10 created the Howard Orlean “Excellence in Site Reuse” award to recognize those who have gone above and beyond in redeveloping Superfund sites. The Port of Portland has demonstrated this through forward thinking, sustained dedication and vital partnership work that have made this project possible.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Groundwater monitoring wells have been installed and semi-annual sampling of the wells is underway.

### Emergency Response and Removal

RMC conducted several early cleanup actions between 1995 and 2002 to remove the most highly contaminated soil, sediment and waste material from the site. In addition, RMC completed demolition of the plant between 2003 and 2005.
