Background
The 6-acre Parsons Chemical Works, Inc. site is located in Oneida Township, Michigan. Parsons Chemical mixed, made and packaged agricultural chemicals on site from 1945 through 1979. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil, sediments, surface water and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality with funding from EPA.  EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Institutional controls have been added to the site by the signage of the Explanation of Significance Differences and allows for continued protectiveness of the In-Situ Vitrification treatment area.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site’s long-term remedy included groundwater monitoring and analysis. It also requires connecting nearby residences to an alternate water supply if existing water supplies become threatened. Long-term monitoring began in 2003. Operation and maintenance activities have been completed. All cleanup goals have been achieved at the Site.
Sampling and Monitoring
All sampling and monitoring activities have been completed at the Site.

Emergency Response and Removal
