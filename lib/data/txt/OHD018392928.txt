### Background

The 25-acre United Scrap Lead (USL) Co., Inc. site is in Troy, Ohio. From 1948 to 1983, lead from batteries was reclaimed on site. Approximately 32,000 cubic yards of crushed battery cases were generated and used as fill material. The battery acid and the rinse water that was produced because of the reclaiming activities was disposed of on site. Facility operations contaminated soil and debris on-site.

Ohio EPA first became concerned about the site conditions in 1979 when the State found levels of cadmium and lead in the groundwater well on-site which exceeded the interim Federal Primary Drinking Water Standards. Ohio EPA required United Scrap Lead Co., Inc. to comply with the State waste disposal regulations and dispose the chipped battery casings off-site. The site was listed on the National Priority List (NPL) in September 1984.

The soil cleanup of the USL site was completed in 2001 and groundwater monitoring at the site was discontinued in the same year after all monitoring wells were found to meet Federal Primary Drinking Water Standards. In September 2021 the site was deleted from the NPL.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The cleanup onsite included decontaminating, removing, and disposing of buildings, drums, and debris offsite. Nearly 62,000 cubic yards of battery casing debris and 11,500 cubic yards of soil were excavated, treated, and shipped offsite for disposal.

To remediate the site, topsoil was imported, and affected areas were re-vegetated. Seven residential and four groundwater monitoring wells were sampled for lead and arsenic in accordance with a Groundwater Monitoring Program Plan for the site. The results showed that the water samples were within the Federal Primary Drinking Water Standards for arsenic or lead.

In addition, EPA’s cleanup at the site also included the installation of residential wells, fencing, groundwater monitoring, institutional controls to limit future use of the site, and short-term actions to address immediate threats to human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed through federal and PRP actions. All cleanup activities have been completed at the United Scrap Lead Co. Inc. site, and the site is considered protective of human health in the long-term.

In September 2021, U.S. EPA finalized the deletion of the United Scrap Lead Co. Superfund site from the National Priorities List (NPL) after determining that the required cleanup was complete and no further action was necessary other than continued operation and maintenance, monitoring, and five-year reviews. The agency did not receive any comments for the proposed deletion. The United Scrap Lead deletion notice was published in the [Federal Register (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/969383.pdf) (4 pp, 274.18 K, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) (on September 14.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. EPA completed the [fifth five-year review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/965434.pdf) (34 pp, 1.94MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) of the site in April 2021 to verify the remedy continues to protect people and the environment. The review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment because impacted soils have been removed, the levels of lead and arsenic in groundwater are below federal drinking water standards, and institutional controls to limit future use of the site have been implemented.
