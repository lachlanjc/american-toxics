### Background

The Newton County Mine Tailings Superfund site encompasses over 600 square miles of Newton County and a portion of Lawrence County. The site is part of the Tri-State Mining District (TSMD) of Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma, formerly one of the richest lead and zinc ore-producing deposits in the world. Mining, milling and smelting of lead and zinc ores at the site began in the mid 1800s and continued in some areas until the 1970s.

After more than 100 years of mining activities, the presence of chat piles, tailing impoundments and mine waste rock piles, are common features of the landscape in Newton County and a portion of Lawrence County. Over the past few decades, much of the total volume of surface mine waste has been removed and reused. However, there are still hundreds of acres of mining and milling wastes that remain. Much of the wastes are contaminated with residual heavy metals and have the potential to contaminate surface soils, groundwater, surface water and stream sediments.

To date, approximately 2.4 million cubic yards of mine waste and contaminated soil have been excavated from the different operable units, and more than 150 acres of mined land have been restored to beneficial use.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The EPA and responsible parties have completed investigation and response work to address residential yards, private drinking water wells and non-residential mining and milling wastes, contaminated soils and stream sediments. Ongoing work is discussed in the section “What is the Current Site Status?”

The site is a concern because of the mining and milling wastes remaining on the surface throughout the county. The wastes constitute a significant source of heavy metals contamination with potential for exposure to people and environmental receptors. Past mining and milling practices have also resulted in the contamination of surface soil, sediments, surface water and groundwater in the shallow aquifer. The primary contaminants of concern are lead, cadmium and zinc.

A preliminary assessment was conducted in the Granby area in 1986 revealing elevated levels of cadmium, lead and zinc significantly above background concentrations in soil and groundwater. As a result of multiple assessments by the state and the EPA, the EPA expanded its investigations of private water wells and residential yard soil in known mining areas throughout the country.

Due to the large number of private residential drinking water wells identified with high levels of lead and cadmium throughout the site, the EPA began providing bottled water to homes in 1998. This action served as a temporary response action while public water supply systems were designed and constructed as part of the removal action to replace the contaminated wells. The EPA completed construction of public water supplies that supply new public water supply mains to serve areas with contaminated residential wells. Additionally, approximately 100 individual deep-aquifer drinking water wells have been installed for homes where it was not feasible to install public water supply mains.

In 1999, the EPA began a removal action for lead-contaminated residential yard soil in approximately 100 properties in the OU 02 portion of the Site. Meanwhile, the PRPs removed lead-contaminated residential yard soil at approximately 300 properties in the OU1 portion of the site, mostly in the city of Granby, under an Administrative Order on Consent. The EPA placed the Newton County portion of the Tri-State Mining District on the National Priorities List on September 29, 2003. Wastes in and around 14 mining camps located within approximately 300 square miles of Newton County have been grouped into five subdistricts: Spring City/Spurgeon, Diamond, Granby, Stark City and Wentworth.

The EPA designated three operable units for cleanup activities due to the location of mine and milling wastes and the location of mining operations by various potentially responsible parties who are liable for cleanup actions.

**Operable Units** – The EPA divided the site into four operable units in addition to operable unit 0 for sitewide activities as follows:

- **OU0** \- Sitewide Activities
- **OU1** \- Diamond/Spring City-Spurgeon/Granby (PRP activities)
- **OU2** \- Remainder of Newton County (EPA activites)
- **OU3** \- Spring River Watershed
- **OU4** \- Groundwater

The remaining risks to the environment and potential human exposure at the site result from the presence of the mining and milling wastes located throughout the county. In 2009, the EPA completed a Remedial Investigation/ Feasibility Study for OU1/OU2 which focused on these wastes and associated soils. A Record of Decision (ROD) for OU1/OU2 was issued in June 2010. The major components of the selected remedy are:

- Removal of metals contaminated mining and milling wastes, soils and intermittent tributary stream sediments
- Disposal of the contaminated wastes, soils and sediments in a central repository to be constructed on site
- Capping of the repository with an 18-inch soil cover
- Recontouring the excavated areas to promote drainage
- Revegetation of the excavated areas and the repository with native grasses
- Monitoring site streams for assessing the effect of cleanup
- Establishing institutional controls to restrict the future use of the disposal areas

The major changes to the 2010 OU1/OU2 ROD were incorporated in an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) signed in September 2018. The changes were reaffirmed in a 2020 ESD, which identified two additional central repositories in the site. The major changes are summarized as follows:

- Increase in the volume of on-site wastes and the associated increase in cost;
- Disposal of the contaminated wastes, soils and sediments in additional central repositories located on existing mining waste piles in upland areas;
- ICs as needed for upland chat areas where property owners agree to environmental covenants; and
- Use of existing central repositories within the Oronogo-Duenweg Mining Belt Superfund site of the district.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA is currently conducting response actions to residential yards, private drinking water wells and non-residential mining and milling wastes, contaminated soils and stream sediments. See the below map of the site. There is ongoing investigation work on residential yards, private drinking water wells, and the watershed.

Under two, time-critical EPA Removal Actions to reduce exposure to lead and other heavy metal contaminants, the EPA is testing for lead contamination in soil and private, domestic drinking water wells at residential properties and high child-use areas across the county. EPA staff and the field support contractor will work with property owners to gain access to conduct lead testing.

The EPA also completed removal activities at the Granby “Dick Smith” City Park. The park is a high child use area located in the center of Granby. The park had areas with high concentrations of lead contamination likely attributable to historical mining and smelting operations.

An interagency agreement was signed in November 2014 with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for the initiation of remedial actions at the site. The EPA and the USACE began the next phase of remedial activities with construction work in spring 2020 in the Granby subdistrict. This remedial action will include the cleanup of heavy metal-contaminated mining wastes, soil and sediment. In this next phase, The EPA will continue to work on road repair and revegetation. The EPA has also conducted multiple sampling events in areas of potential contamination throughout Newton County.

The EPA has awarded a contract to begin remediation activities in the Spring City/Spurgeon area. Future work at the site includes remediation in Wentworth, Stark City, Diamond and the closure of the central repositories.

Throughout the project, the EPA is continuing work on road repair and revegetation and continues to sample both residential and non-residential properties throughout the county.

The Action Memorandums (removal actions), RODs (remedial actions), and other remedy decision documents can be found within the administrative records for the site on the site Documents & Data section of this website.

OU3 -this OU addresses contaminated surface water and sediments in the Spring River and Lost Creek watersheds as a part of the Tri-State Mining District Watersheds that connect three states and two EPA Regions 6 and 7. For the purposes of site characterization, the Spring River Basin was split into Upper and Lower units. The EPA has completed a Remedial Investigation report for the Upper and Lower Spring River Basin which includes OU3. This report analyzed contamination from unconsolidated mine waste that has been released or is being released into the watersheds creeks, streams, and adjacent floodplain soils. Currently, the EPA is developing Non-Time Critical Removal Actions to support the ongoing Feasibility Study to evaluate cleanup technologies.

Technical documents for the ongoing investigations within the watersheds are available on the Site Documents & Data section of this site profile page, under Reports and Documents, link for OU3 Spring River Watershed Technical Documents.

OU4 was also added to address the groundwater contamination within the site boundary. A remedy decision to address the groundwater at the site has not been made.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The EPA continues to sample private drinking water wells, residential and non-residential properties throughout the county. For more information, please contact EPA Site Contacts on this page.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions from 1999 to 2003 included excavation of contaminated soils from about 300 residential properties. The EPA provided bottled water to affected residences until these homes are connected to public water supplies. The EPA has also installed about 110 deep water wells (replacements) in isolated areas where water lines are inaccessible.

New time-critical removal actions have begun to address newly identified residential yards and private drinking water wells with site-related contamination. The EPA also completed removal activities at the Granby “Dick Smith” City Park and the Granby Elemetary School
