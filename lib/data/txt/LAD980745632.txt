### Background

**Current Status**

The fifth five-year review for the site was completed in August 2016. The review determined that the remedy for the Bayou Bonfouca Superfund site is short-term protective and it specified the actions that need to be taken for the remedy to be protective over the long term. Those actions include: groundwater use restrictions need to be implemented above the southwestern groundwater plume; subsidence monitoring well SM-5 needs to be replaced; the groundwater site plume map should be updated; the applicability of EPA’s 2015 vapor intrusion guidance needs to be evaluated; and the groundwater remedy should be optimized to assess the effectiveness of the remedy. The following actions have been completed or are underway: SM-5 was properly plugged and abandoned and a new well was drilled as a replacement; a work plan is being developed for the sampling needed to update the plume map; the site is on EPA's list of 2018 remedy optimization sites.

**Site Background**

The 54-acre Bayou Bonfouca site is located in Slidell, Louisiana. A creosote plant began operating on site in 1882. During operations, numerous releases of creosote took place from spills, runoff and discharges. In the early 1970s, a fire at the plant ruptured several large storage tanks, causing creosote to flow onto the site and into the bayou. Operations ended in 1972, followed by disassembly of the plant. Operations contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater. Contamination resulted in sterilization of Bayou Bonfouca for more than a one-mile stretch. EPA completed the cleanup of contaminated soils and sediment in 1997. Today, site operation and maintenance activities and groundwater treatment and monitoring are continuing to extract and treat contaminated groundwater.

**Location:** The site includes about 54 acres and associated Bayou sediments. It is located in Slidell, Louisiana on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain and includes the former American Creosote Works Plant and a portion of scenic Bayou Bonfouca. The site is south of West Hall Avenue in Slidell and north of and adjacent to Bayou Bonfouca (See Site Map).

**Population:** About 750 residents live within a mile of the site. Approximately 26,000 residents live in the surrounding community of Slidell. The nearest residence is about 400 feet across the bayou to the southwest.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site's cleanup was addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. During the 1990's, EPA contracts for subcontracting services in St. Tammany Parish spent about $12 million during the cleanup. EPA contractors and subcontractors locally hired, trained and employed between 80 and 90 percent of field and office staff.  
  
EPA has conducted five five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The next five-year review of the site remedy is due in August 2021.

The City of Slidell (the site property owner) has restricted the use of groundwater at and near the site. The City controls access to the site as well as restricts excavation on the containment cap. Both site restrictions ensure the continued protection of human health and the environment.

EPA listed the Bayou Bonfouca site on the National Priorities List in 1983. EPA excavated and incinerated over 170,000 cubic yards of contaminated bayou sediments and creosote waste from November 1993 to July 1995. The resultant ash and on-site contaminated soils were placed on site in a RCRA-compliant Subtitle C landfill. The Closeout Report for the source material (soils and sediment) was completed in 1997. Following Hurricane Katrina in 2006, sediments were sampled and it was determined that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita had no impact on the protectiveness of the site's remedy in the bayou.

EPA began operation of the long-term remedial action for dense non aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL) in groundwater in July 1991. Well installation and groundwater treatment plant upgrades reached completion in 2000. The treatment plant currently extracts contaminated groundwater, collects DNAPL and discharges treated groundwater to Bayou Bonfouca. The separated DNAPL is stored on site and then disposed of off-site as a hazardous waste. The State of Louisiana assumed responsibility for operation and maintenance (O&M) at the Site in July 2001 and continues with the site O&M today.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The long-term remedy included dredging of contaminated sediment in Bayou Bonfouca, on-site incineration of contaminated soil and sediment, and extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater. The remedy cleaned up over 170,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediment and soils. Incineration of contaminated soil and sediment was completed in 1995. To date, nearly 17.4 million gallons of contaminated groundwater have been treated and discharged. Groundwater treatment began in 1991 and is ongoing.

### Sampling and Monitoring

EPA and LDEQ continue to review the operation and maintenance of the groundwater pump and treatment system. The system extracts groundwater which is contaminated with creosote and removes the creosote from the groundwater. The creosote that is removed from the groundwater is stored onsite and disposed of regularly. Monthly operational reports for the groundwater treatment system are submitted to the EPA for review and comment.
