### Background

The Goldisc Recordings site (Site) is located in Holbrook, New York and is situated on approximately 34 acres of land in a commercial/industrial section of eastern Long Island. The 34-acre area consists of two one-story buildings that occupy six acres, three acres of pavement surrounding the buildings and 25 acres of undeveloped land. Between 1968 and 1983, Audio Visual, Inc. manufactured audio visual and optical devices, and Goldisc Recordings, Inc. manufactured phonograph records. Wastes generated included large quantities of nickel-plating wastes and hydraulic oil, and lesser quantities of solvents. Plating wastes were stored in aboveground storage tanks. On several occasions, the Suffolk County Department of Health Services (SCDHS) found chemical wastes in storm drains, holding ponds and dry wells.Contaminants seeped into the aquifer beneath the Site. SCDHS found that wastes containing nickel, copper, iron, cadmium, zinc, lead, and chromium were spilled or leaked onto a paved area of the Site. The former owner, First Holbrook Company, cleaned the on-site holding ponds and installed monitoring wells. Approximately 19,500 people live within a mile of the Site; 70,500 people live within 3 miles. There also are several schools within a mile of the Site. Approximately 130 wells located within 3 miles of the Site serve 71,000 people. Public water supply wells are located 1,000 feet downgradient of the Site. A shallow public water supply well was removed from operation in late 1993, as a result of nickel contamination, which was believed to be directly attributable to the Site. It has since been returned to operation. Groundwater is the only source of water supply in the area. Site Responsibility: This Site is being addressed through Federal, State and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. Under current conditions at the site, potential or actual human exposures are under control. Source materials have been cleaned up. Additional groundwater monitoring is expected to continue for nickel, the primary contaminant of concern (COC).

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Entire Site: Following a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the nature and extent of site contamination and to evaluate remedial alternatives, EPA selected a remedy for the site’s source areas in the site’s September 1995 Record of Decision, or ROD. The remedy included source removal of contaminated soils and dry well sediments. These materials were removed in 1997.

EPA selected the site’s groundwater remedy – monitored natural attenuation – in the site’s September 1998 ROD. Natural attenuation describes a variety of in-place processes that, under favorable conditions, act without human intervention to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume or concentration of contaminants in groundwater.

  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in two remedial phases. One phase focuses on contaminated soils and sediments. The other phase focuses on contaminated groundwater.

In September 1998, EPA issued a ROD calling for Monitored Natural Attenuation of the groundwater. The groundwater monitoring program is ongoing with the potentially responsible party (PRP) and EPA performing the groundwater sampling activities. On September 30, 1998, EPA determined that all Site construction activities had been completed. In October 2016, EPA performed additional groundwater sampling. Nickel concentrations continue to be stable, with one monitoring well out of the seven sampled showing a level above the NYS standard. EPA performed additional groundwater sampling in October 2019 and will continue to evaluate the remedy for the Site.

EPA issued the fourth Five-Year Review in May 2018 which showed that the Site continues to be protective of human health and the environment.
