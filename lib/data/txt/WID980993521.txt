### Background

Groundwater in the northern part of Wausau was contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a municipal landfill and a chemical facility. The Superfund site consists of two contaminant source areas separated by the Wisconsin River. The eastern portion of the site is related to solvent spills from the former Wausau Chemical facility, and the western portion is related to the former City of Wausau landfill.

EPA’s cleanup of volatile organic compounds at the site consisted of several extraction wells and treatment systems, two soil vapor extraction systems, a landfill cover over the waste area, land and groundwater-use restrictions, and groundwater monitoring.

In 2023 and 2024, the EPA oversaw vapor intrusion sampling at commercial buildings which were identified as potential vapor intrusion risks based on their proximity to source areas or elevated groundwater concentrations. Results did not show any health risks related to vapor intrusion, except for one indoor air exceedance.

In March 2024, the EPA released a significant modification to the existing site remedy in order to protect human health and the environment. The change imposes additional municipal ordinances and land use restrictions, which are documented in an Explanation of Significant Differences (53pp, 7.5MB).

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA’s cleanup of volatile organic compounds consisted of several extraction wells and treatment systems, two soil vapor extraction systems, a landfill cover over the waste area, land and groundwater-use restrictions, and groundwater monitoring.

Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing. Follow-up actions to address long-term protectiveness included a review of pumping rates for the extraction wells, a review of the effectiveness of the site’s institutional controls such as well installation regulations and prepare a long-term stewardship plan.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA completed a [review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/955611.pdf) (211 pp, 17.8MB[,](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/955611.pdf) [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) of the site's cleanup in April 2020. This type of review is required at least every five years where the cleanup is complete but hazardous waste remains managed on-site. These reviews are done to ensure that the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. It was this site’s sixth five-year review.

The review included:

- An evaluation of background information
- Cleanup requirements
- Effectiveness of the cleanup and any anticipated future actions
- Maintenance and monitoring efforts
- An analysis of ways for EPA to operate more efficiently

The review deferred the decision, or determination, as to whether the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment pending the completion of additional ongoing investigations. EPA expects to make that determination by 2022. The next scheduled five-year review will be in 2025.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Several homes are being sampled to determine if vapor intrusion is present.
