### Background

The 21-acre North Cavalcade site is located in Houston, Texas. Houston Creosoting Company established wood-preserving operations on site in 1946. These operations continued until 1961, contaminating the site with hazardous chemicals. Following construction of the site’s remedy, long-term groundwater cleanup is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy includes implementation of institutional controls to restrict use of the property and prevent use of groundwater, as well as assessments of the presence of pentachlorophenol (PCP), solvent constituents and the use of industrial reuse assumptions for naphthalene.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA selected the site’s original long-term remedy in 1988. It included biological degradation of soil contaminants and extraction and treatment of groundwater. EPA later updated the remedy to change soil cleanup criteria. EPA updated the remedy in 2009, replacing the original soil and groundwater remedies with containment and capping of soils and in-place solidification of groundwater source areas. EPA updated the remedy in 2011 to treat dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) in monitoring wells by including containment of shallow sand and dissolved phase plumes and institutional controls to restrict installation of groundwater wells.

In-place stabilization of groundwater source areas finished in 2010. Installation of a permanent monitoring well network took place between 2010 and 2011. Soil capping and containment finished in 2011. DNAPL removal took place from 2011 to 2012. Operation and maintenance activities and groundwater monitoring are ongoing.

Houston Creosoting Company established wood-preserving operations on site in 1946. These operations continued until 1961. The operations encompassed about 9 acres on the southern portion of the property and included creosote ponds, various tanks and storage units, a lumber shed, a treatment facility, and other buildings.Houston Creosoting Company established wood-preserving operations on site in 1946.
