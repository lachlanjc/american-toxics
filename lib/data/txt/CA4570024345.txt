### Background

The 2,165-acre Norton Air Force Base site in San Bernardino, California, served as a major overhaul center for jet engines and aircraft repair beginning in 1942. Past hazardous material management practices contaminated groundwater and soil with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, heavy metals (such as lead) and acids. Following construction of the site’s remedy, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed by the Air Force.The long-term remedy included no further action at 87 subsites, groundwater monitoring, groundwater extraction and treatment via air stripping, in-place soil vapor extraction, institutional controls and removal actions. Construction of the remedies for the site finished in 2006. Institutional controls to restrict uses of certain areas for residential purposes protect human health and the environment. The groundwater remedy achieved cleanup objectives and no longer requires clean up. The Air Force completed removal of lead-contaminated soils located near a former Small Arms Range in 2019.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Operation and maintenance activities, including groundwater monitoring, landfill gas monitoring, inspections and cap maintenance, are ongoing. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The AF drafted the Fifth Five-Year Report in June 2020, and revised the report in September 2020 to address EPA's comments. Not all of EPA's comments were addressed, and EPA issued an independent protectiveness statement. EPA deferred the protectiveness statement until further information could be obtained regarding whether Per- and Polyfluoralkyl substances in soils and groundwater at the site present any current exposures to human health and the environment. The EPA expects the AF to finalize the Report to incoprorate additional EPA comments, and EPA will issue a final determination by September 2021.
