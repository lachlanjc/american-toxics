### Background

The Davenport and Flagstaff Smelters site is about 15 miles southeast of Salt Lake City, Utah. It is in a mostly residential and commercial area at the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon.

The Davenport and Flagstaff Smelters were built around 1870. Both smelters processed lead and silver ore removed from mines near Alta, Utah. Historical operations contaminated soil with metals. Operators decommissioned and dismantled both smelters by 1879. After that, the site use was mostly agricultural. In the 1970s and 1980s, a restaurant and a residential community began to develop.

The cleanup of the site is finished. Today, the operation and maintenance of the cleanup are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being cleaned up and managed by the federal and state government and private companies who own land on the site or have done work on the site. Under Superfund law, these private companies are called potentially responsible parties.

The EPA has done several five-year reviews at the site. These reviews make sure that the cleanup work protects public health and the environment. The reviews also make sure that the cleanup was done following the plans made in the decision documents.

The most recent review found that the cleanup at the site was done according to plan and protects human health and the environment.

The EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in April 2003. Once the cleanup was finished, the site was deleted from the list on July 27, 2018.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Based on the January 2024 [Updated Lead Guidance](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/updated-soil-lead-guidance-cercla-sites-and-rcra-corrective-action-facilities), the EPA is evaluating the risks from lead in soils to sensitive populations. This analysis will include compiling available site data to determine the potential presence and extent of lead-contaminated soils. Lead can pose health risks to sensitive populations, especially children under 7 years old and pregnant or nursing women. The process to implement the Updated Lead Guidance will involve additional planning, data gathering, risk assessment and funding requests. EPA will coordinate with our state partners and request public feedback on our proposed cleanup plans before additional cleanups begin.

While implementing the Updated Lead Guidance may take several years to complete, the EPA and Utah Department of Environmental Quality will share information on planned activities and results as they become available. In the meantime, and out of an abundance of caution, if you live near the Davenport and Flagstaff Superfund Site, the EPA recommends you have your children tested for lead annually; especially those under 7 and if the soil at your property was not replaced previously. Additionally, you can take some simple actions to limit exposure to potential lead contamination in soils, including:

- Maintaining yards and other soil cover;
- Washing hands, especially children’s, after handling soil, playing outside, and before meals;
- Making sure children eat nutritious meals high in iron and calcium;
- Keeping dust levels down by mopping and damp dusting regularly;
- Regularly changing out furnace filters;
- Keeping kids’ toys and play areas clean;
- Taking shoes off at the door and keeping pets clean;
- Wearing gloves while gardening; and
- Cleaning homegrown produce and peeling root vegetables.

The EPA Davenport and Flagstaff Superfund Site team will communicate with residents affected by this guidance about the specific next steps the Agency will take in their community. Residents may also contact the site’s Community Involvement Coordinator with questions or concerns at [haniewicz.missy@epa.gov](mailto:haniewicz.missy@epa.gov?subject=Davenport%20and%20Flagstaff%20Smelters%20site) or 720-415-4609.

The site consists of three areas, called operable units (OUs).

OU1addresses residential properties with lead and arsenic contamination in surface and subsurface soils.

OU2 covers about 29 acres and consists of a mixture of commercial and undeveloped land.

OU3 addresses agricultural land proposed for future residential use near the Flagstaff Smelter.

**OU1:** The long-term cleanup plan was selected in 2002. This plan included excavation and off-site disposal of all material contaminated above the cleanup levels. The cleanup also included rules and requirements to protect the site, call institutional controls.

The OU1 cleanup began in 2004 and finished in 2008. Contaminated soils were removed. Then, landscapes were restored at 26 properties. About 33,000 cubic yards of lead- and arsenic-impacted soils were removed and taken off site for disposal.

**OU2:** The long-term cleanup plan was selected in 2009. This plan included:

- excavation
- on-site treatment of waste
- off-site disposal of material contaminated above cleanup levels
- site restoration
- institutional controls

Cleanup began in August 2011 and finished in December 2011. About 7,100 tons of contaminated soil were excavated and disposed of off-site. About 6,600 tons of that soil were treated on site prior to disposal.

**OU3:** The long-term cleanup plan was selected in 2005 as a modification to the OU1 plan. This plan included excavation and treatment of contaminated soil on 49 acres of undeveloped property and institutional controls. A private company cleaned up OU3 in 2006 with EPA and state oversight. About 77,000 tons of contaminated soil were excavated, treated and disposed of offsite.

The site reached the Superfund milestone “construction complete” in August 2012.
