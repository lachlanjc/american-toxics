### Background

The Raleigh Street Dump [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in an industrial area of Tampa, Florida, directly east of McKay Bay. Remaining areas of the site include wetlands, vacant land and fill areas where former operations disposed of wastes. The Port of Tampa and a creek border the site to the south, vacant land to the north, vacant land and commercial businesses to the east, and a railroad yard to the west. The nearest residences are over a half-mile northeast of the site and several businesses are within a quarter-mile of the site. Tampa Fiberglass continues to operate a fiberglass production facility on the southern portion of the site.

It includes the area where battery waste and other waste streams were disposed from 1977 to 1991. In 1988, the Hillsborough County Environmental Protection Commission received complaints that Tampa Fiberglass improperly disposed of waste at the site.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 2009, because of contaminated soil and groundwater resulting from waste handling practices.

EPA and the [Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP)](https://floridadep.gov/) investigated site conditions. By designing and carrying out a cleanup plan, EPA, FDEP and the site’s [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) will protect people and the environment from site contamination.

The [second Five Year Review,](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11174954.pdf) completed in December 2022, found that the site is currently protective.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA led site investigation activities in cooperation with FDEP. Site PRPs currently lead cleanup activities with oversight provided by EPA and FDEP.

**2009**  
EPA issued the cleanup plan (a Record of Decision, or ROD) for the site. It includes

- digging up contaminated soils and properly disposing of them
- adding clean soil to fill in dug-up areas
- restoring wetland areas
- monitored natural attenuation of groundwater contaminants
- placing institutional controls on the site to limit the future use of soil and groundwater.

**2012 - 2014**  
Cleanup started in October 2012, with completion of all construction and soil excavation in March 2014.

**2017**

The [first Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11095627.pdf), completed in November 2017, found that the site cleanup approach is working as expected and continues to protect people and the environment from remaining contamination. The PRP continues to conduct regular groundwater sampling and submit quarterly groundwater monitoring reports to EPA and FDEP.

**2022**

The [second Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11174954.pdf), completed in December 2022, found that the site cleanup approach is working as expected and continues to protect people and the environment from remaining contamination. The PRP continues to conduct regular groundwater sampling and submit semi-annual groundwater monitoring reports to EPA and FDEP.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Groundwater and wetlands restoration monitoring are ongoing.

The [second Five-Year Review (FYR)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11174954.pdf) was completed by EPA in December 2022. The FYR found that the site is currently protective. The soil and wetland remediation is complete. Groundwater remediation is through monitored natural attenuation. The groundwater is being monitored quarterly until the site reaches the established cleanup goals. EPA and FDEP continue to review the groundwater analytical data to monitor the remedial progress. The next review will be due in 2027.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls (restrictive covenants) have been placed on the site property. All parcels include restrictions on property use and activities to protect the selected site remedy.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA negotiated legal agreements with site PRPs to design and carry out the site’s cleanup.
