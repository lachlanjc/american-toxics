### Background

BJAT LLC is an approximately 18.3-acre property located at 300 Fisher Street in Franklin, Norfolk County, Massachusetts. The site was first developed with a beet sugar refinery in the 1880s. Beginning in approximately 1899 and continuing into the 1940s, the site was used for rubber manufacturing. Later activities from the 1950s to 1980s involved plastic manufacturing. The property was last used for industrial activities in 1985. Hazardous materials, specifically including metals, semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and perfluorinated compounds (PFAS) were disposed and/or abandoned on-site during these historical operations.

The property is zoned for industrial use, and bounded by an industrial park to the northeast, an inactive rail line to the south, Mine Brook and a wetland system to the north, and interstate 495 to the west. The Town of Franklin operates a drinking water supply well approximately one half-mile northwest of the site, and a public swimming beach approximately three quarters of a mile north of the site.

The current owner of the site conducted four environmental investigations under the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP; Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection’s cleanup regulations) from 2005 to 2012. These included an Environmental Site Assessment in 2005; a Subsurface Investigation in 2007; a Site Inspection in 2008 and a Comprehensive Site Assessment in 2012. Previous investigations have found process waste and debris containing hazardous substances including metals and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) at concentrations above applicable state standards. The site was listed on EPA's National Priorities List (NPL) in September 2015.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts referred the site to the EPA because the contaminated groundwater plume is affecting nearby properties and wetlands, and contamination on the property poses a hazard to people that may come in contact with soil and debris. The EPA received a letter of support for placing this site on the NPL from the state. The site was listed on EPA's National Priorities List (NPL) in September 2015.

The property owners acquired the site in 2006, and performed several environmental studies and cleanup actions. A fire occurred at the site in April 2015, and the site was subsequently added to the NPL in September 2015. The owners demolished the industrial buildings and performed a removal action, removing drums and contaminated soil from portions of the site, and covering an area of surficial soil containing lead with an earthen cap.

EPA began a Remedial Investigation / Feasibility Study (RI/FS) in September 2016. The “RI” phase is a testing program intended to document the sources and types of contamination, define contaminated areas and pathways for contaminant migration, and document the specific chemicals of concern and their potential human health and ecological risks. The RI process involved extensive soil, groundwater, sediment, surface water and fish tissue monitoring on the property, as well as upstream and downstream locations.

The “FS” phase evaluates strategies to address these risks, weighed against a number of criteria, including short-term and long-term effectiveness, cost, and stakeholder and community feedback. The RI phase is nearing completion and the FS is being developed, and EPA is considering multiple different approaches to manage contaminants at and near the site, including potentially soil / sediment removal, capping the materials in-place, and treating groundwater.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The property is privately owned and the property owner demolished the building and performed a “removal action” in 2018-2019, removing drums and contaminated soil from portions of the site and capping other soil which posed a direct contact risk to site users (generally, trespasser and recreational users).
