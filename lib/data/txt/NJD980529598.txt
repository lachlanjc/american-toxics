### Background

The Pepe Field site is located in Boontown, New Jersey. E.F. Drew Co. operated a landfill at this property from the 1920s until 1950. From 1950 until the mid-1960s, the site remained an open, unused area until the Town of Boonton purchased the property. During the mid-1960s, the town covered the site with soil in preparation for construction of a recreation facility.

Unknown quantities of processing waste from the manufacturing of edible oils and cleaning products for household and industrial use were disposed at the site. From 1950 until the mid-1960s, the site remained an open, unused area until the Town of Boonton purchased the property. During the mid-1960s, the town covered the site with soil in preparation for construction of a recreational facility. This facility included tennis courts, a baseball field, a playground area and a refreshment stand. Because of the biological decay of waste material beneath the field, the area was subjected to strong hydrogen sulfide odors.

In 1969, the town implemented an odor abatement plan for the site, which consists of a 14-foot gravel curtain drain extending 150 feet along one side of the field, a sump for leachate collection and leachate treatment with hydrogen peroxide. The pump house discharged into a culvert that ultimately discharged into the Rockaway River. The recreation field was closed for many years until cleanup and restoration work finished in November 2000

Because of the biological decay of waste material beneath the field, the area was subjected to strong hydrogen sulfide odors. In 1969, the town implemented an odor abatement plan for the site. The recreation field was closed for many years until cleanup and restoration work finished in November 2000. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the National Priorities List in July 2003.

After site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Following a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine the nature and extent of the contamination and to evaluate remedial alternatives, EPA selected a containment remedy in the site’s 1989 Record of Decision, or ROD. It included maintaining a site cover, installing a landfill gas collection and treatment system, upgrading and maintaining a leachate collection and treatment system, and monitoring groundwater. EPA updated the remedy in July 1997 to enable Pepe Field waste to be stabilized prior to excavation. Following its removal, the waste would be loaded onto trucks and taken off site for disposal. The field would then be restored as a recreational facility.  

Phase 1 remedial activities included installation of an extensive air monitoring network, removal of aboveground items on the field and a demonstration test to confirm the effectiveness of the stabilization technology. These activities finished in the fall of 1998. Phase 2 remedial activities included stabilization, excavation and treatment of about 50,000 cubic yards of waste material; pumping and pretreatment of leachate before discharge to the Rockaway Valley Regional Sewerage Authority; and backfilling of the waste area with clean soil and topsoil.  

In addition, the Phase II work included restoration of the park. The major components of the new park are a regulation little league field, a walking path, a playground, a basketball court, a gazebo, a flag pole area and a concession stand. Park restoration also included new fencing, sidewalks and retaining walls. The park reopened in November 2000. All restoration work finished in 2002.  
  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site was addressed in a single long-term remedial phase focused on remediation of the entire site.  

The cleanup plan for the site included maintaining a site cover, installing a landfill gas collection and treatment system, upgrading and maintaining a leachate collection and treatment system, and monitoring groundwater. EPA updated the remedy in July 1997 to enable Pepe Field waste to be stabilized prior to excavation. EPA completed all restoration work in 2002 and transfer of ownership of a residential property adjacent to the site from the federal government to the Town of Boonton for their use in conjunction with the park was completed.  

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in July 2003.
