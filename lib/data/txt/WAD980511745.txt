### Background

The 324-acre Queen City Farms site is located 2.5 miles north of Maple Valley, Washington adjacent to the Cedar Hills Regional Landfill. The area surrounding the site is semi-rural. From 1955 to 1964 a three-acre area of the site was used for the disposal of industrial hazardous waste. Local industries transported the liquid waste in drums and tanker trucks and discharged them into three onsite ponds. When full, the wastes in the ponds were burned off to create additional capacity.

In 1979, the EPA began to investigate the residual waste, soil, and sediment and found significant concentrations of heavy metals, volatile organic carbon ( [VOCs](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=VOC) ), hydrocarbons, and [PCBs](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=PCB). The ponds were the primary source of contamination of soil and groundwater at the site.

The most heavily contaminated soils and wastes at the site were excavated and disposed at a hazardous waste facility. Contaminated soils left on the site were consolidated in the area of the former ponds, surrounded by a barrier wall and capped. The capped area is regularly inspected and maintained.

Groundwater affected by the contamination is recovering by monitored natural processes. In 2015, the extraction and treatment system were constructed in the southeast portion of the site to supplement the natural groundwater recovery. It will continue to be monitored until groundwater cleanup levels are achieved.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA began to investigate wastes, soils and groundwater at the site in 1979. In 1980, the ponds were sampled by EPA; heavy metals and VOCs were found in the water, sludge and sediment. On September 21, 1984, the EPA added the site to the National Priorities List. In 1985, EPA issued an interim cleanup plan that focused on closing the three waste ponds. On December 31, 1992, EPA issued a Record of Decision that selected cleanup actions to address contaminated soil and groundwater at the site. The groundwater plan was amended in 2014 to provide for groundwater extraction and treatment. EPA has provided oversight of potentially responsible parties actions to investigate the site, evaluate cleanup alternatives and implement the cleanup. Every five years, EPA reviews the protectiveness of the remedy. EPA Region 10 completed the third Five-Year Review for the Queen City Farms Superfund site in 2023. The [five-year review report](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/10/100494859) is now available for you to learn more about the site and its cleanup.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1993, EPA issued the long-term cleanup plan (Record of Decision) for the entire site. It included removal and isolation of contaminated soils and remediation of groundwater contamination through natural processes. The plan also included a contingency to implement a groundwater extraction and treatment system if progress toward meeting cleanup goals was delayed.

In 2020, EPA formally documented the completion of all soil cleanup actions at the site and EPA deleted the soils from the National Priorities List. Groundwater cleanupwill continue until groundwater cleanup levels are achieved.

Approximately 26 acres in the northwest corner of the site will continue to be used by Cedar Grove Composting to produce compost from green waste. Reclamation of the area previously mined for gravel will also continue until the area is returned to pre-mining conditions. Any activities at the site that could adversely impact the Superfund cleanup work are prohibited.

**Cleanup Progress**

The siteâ€™s potentially responsible parties (Boeing and Queen City Farms Inc.) conducted several early cleanup actions at the site. All soil actions identified in the 1993 cleanup plan have been completed. Maintenance of the cap and barrier wall system is required. Restrictions are in place to protect the barrier wall and cap and to prohibit future residential, agricultural, and groundwater use. In 2020, EPA documented the completion of all soil cleanup actions and deleted the soil from the NPL.

The responsible parties have implemented all groundwater cleanup actions. In 2015, a groundwater extraction and treatment system were constructed in the southeast portion of the site. Groundwater will continue to be monitored until cleanup levels are achieved.

EPA has conducted six five-year reviews at the site. The [2023 review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/10/100494859) found that the remedy currently protected people's health and the environment.

### Emergency Response and Removal

A potentially responsible party-led removal action was conducted in 1988 to stabilize the Queen City Farms area of the site. An emergency removal of wastes in the processing area occurred in 1990.
