### Background

The Alamo Contaminated Ground Water Superfund site is located Alamo, Tennessee, about 10 miles northwest of Jackson. It includes an area of contaminated groundwater potentially resulting from various operations in the community’s downtown business district. The contamination has affected two public water supply wells. Other private wells and county utility district wells are located within a mile of the known affected area.

Since 1991, the City of Alamo has treated water from public wells through a process known as air stripping. Water in the public water supply system meets all federal drinking water standards. The public water supply is available to all city residents and businesses.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-gloassary#n) in 2011 with support from the [Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC)](http://www.tn.gov/environment/about). EPA is preparing to conduct an extensive investigation to fully assess site-related threats to nearby residents and the environment and to evaluate cleanup options.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Alamo site includes an area of contaminated groundwater located mostly in commercial areas of the city’s downtown business district. EPA is working to determine how far the contaminated groundwater has spread.

**1988**  
Groundwater samples from two of the city’s four public water supply wells revealed volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including perchloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE). Levels of these VOCs were above federal drinking water standards.

The contaminated groundwater is located within the Memphis Sands Aquifer, the primary source of drinking water for this area of Tennessee.

EPA and state follow-up investigations discovered multiple potential sources of VOC contamination in the area. Other private wells and county utility district wells are located within a mile of the known affected area.

The State of Tennessee referred the site to EPA because contaminated groundwater has impacted the city’s public drinking water wells and because parties do not yet know the size of the affected groundwater area.

**2011**  
EPA listed the site on the National Priorities List.

**2012**  
EPA began the remedial investigation/feasibility study at the Site. The first attempt to remedy the situation for the town was to find an alternate drinking water source by installing a new drinking water well for the town. Two attempts were made, one near the town ball fields south of town and one attempt to the north of town. Both wells were not able to produce enough water to supply the town and were abandoned.

**2016**  
A more focused remedial investigation (RI) was conducted to try and pinpoint the source of the chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) contamination found in the city’s wells.

One source is known to be former Volunteer Circuits which is located almost directly adjacent to the city well field. This facility operated from 1973-1975 and manufactured circuit boards.

Two former dry cleaners, Ward and Church Street, may be potential sources. Both former cleaners have residual CVOCs located in the soil and groundwater beneath them.

**2017**  
EPA completed the RI in the spring.

**2018**  
After EPA Issued its Proposed Plan and received comments, the Interim Record of Decision was signed by EPA on September 27, 2018. The IROD documented the following remedy for the site:

- Installation of a new low-profile air stripper to replace the current one the town is using;
- Installation of a Soil Vapor Extraction (SVE) system at the former Wards Dry Cleaners site to remove volatile organics from the soil to prevent further migration to the groundwater in the town.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Currently the town is utilizing an air stripper to remove the chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOC) contamination from the town's water supply prior to distribution to the public.

The water is tested on a triannual basis for CVOCs and to date has remained within acceptable levels for consumption.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The public water supply is available to all city residents and businesses.

### Sampling and Monitoring

EPA is conducting sampling at the site to determine the scope and to find the sources of the CVOC contamination.
