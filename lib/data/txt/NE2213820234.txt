### Background

The Cornhusker Army Ammunition Plant is a 12,042-acre site near Grand Island, Nebraska. The U.S. Army built the plant in 1942 to produce munitions and provide support functions during World War II. The plant area includes five major production areas where munitions were loaded, assembled and packed; a fertilizer manufacturer; two major storage facilities; sanitary landfills and burning grounds where materials contaminated with explosives were ignited. Improper disposal of contaminated wastewater and other plant operations resulted in groundwater contamination on and off the site. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is conducting remedial investigations, remedial actions, and continuous groundwater monitoring.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

This site is being addressed through Department of Defense (DoD) Federal Facility actions with oversight by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy, or NDEE (formerly known as the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality, or NDEQ). The EPA, the NDEQ and DoD signed an Interagency Agreement in 1990 that describes how the Army will perform work to investigate and clean up the site.

The EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews evaluate whether the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires continued groundwater monitoring and implementation of institutional controls.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Systems are currently in place at the site for extracting and treating contaminated groundwater. In addition to extraction and treatment, the remedy for the groundwater contamination includes monitored natural attenuation and long-term monitoring. Natural attenuation describes a variety of in-place processes that, under favorable conditions, act without human intervention to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume or concentration of contaminants in groundwater. Remedies for other parts of the site include removal of soil contaminants and debris and institutional controls to prevent the property’s use for non-industrial purposes.

At this time, USACE has conducted a trial shutdown of the groundwater (Operable Unit 1) extraction and treatment system, combined with a program of nutrient injections to enhance natural contaminant degradation processes in the groundwater. UponCompletion of this rebound study, USACE prepared and submitted a focused feasibility study to evaluate the potential of alternative remedies.Amutual agreement between USACE, NDEE and the EPA have deemed the remedial alternatives worthy and USACE began preparing a proposed plan to document the decison process. The proposed plan is set to be available for public comment in February.

The USACE/Army is currently evaluating whether contamination remains at Operable Unit 5. The first phase of site cleanup at Operable Unit 5 included excavating and sifting soil to locate and dispose of gravel mines. Under the second stage of work, sifted soil, as well as the excavated site, was characterized for contaminant concentrations that exceed cleanup levels. The USACE transported and disposed of soils with contaminants above cleanup levels to an off-site facility. At this time, USACE is completing a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study at Operable Unit 5, to determine nature and extent of any remaining contamination and evaluate the feasibility of remedial alternatives.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Immediate actions included the disconnection of the well from the public water supply and extraction of contaminated groundwater. From 1987 to 1988, the Army incinerated 40,000 tons of contaminated soil in the surface impoundments.

The Army provided bottled water to the 250 homes with contaminated wells until residences were hooked up to the city's water system in 1986. In 1991 and 1992, the Army provided bottled water to additional homes with contaminated wells until residences were hooked up to the city's water system.
