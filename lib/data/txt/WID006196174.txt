### Background

The 320-acre National Presto Industries, Inc. (NPI) site lies almost entirely within the city of Eau Claire and abuts the town of Hallie, Wisconsin. The United States Government War Assets Administration owned the site from the early 1940s to 1947. Government contractors manufactured radar tubes and ordnance chemicals at the facility until 1945. NPI purchased the property from the federal government in 1947 and made household appliances, outboard motors and defense-related products. By 1954, operations were entirely defense-related; NPI manufactured artillery shells. After limited production between 1959 and 1965, NPI again manufactured artillery shells on site from 1966 to 1980. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA issued three cleanup decisions, referred to as records of decision:

1990--a permanent alternate drinking water supply for the area in Hallie affected by groundwater Plumes 3, 4, and 5. This involved the construction of a new water supply system.

1991--an interim cleanup to address on-site contaminated water. This was needed to prevent the off-site movement of Plumes 1, 2, and 3 and to prevent further degradation of groundwater quality. The selected cleanup included installation of groundwater extraction wells and treatment of the extracted water by two independent cascade aeration units.

1996--further addressed groundwater contamination affecting the Eau Claire Well Field. This involved installation of soil vapor extraction at Melby Road; removal of soil/waste from drainage ditch and dry wells 2 and 5; continued operation of an air stripper for Plumes 1 and 2; continued operation of pump and treat for Plumes 3 and 4; long-term monitoring of Plume 5; surface water sampling in Lake Hallie; and institutional controls.

This site will require long-term groundwater treatment, soil vapor extraction, groundwater monitoring, and cap maintenance. Although groundwater currently shows improvement at this time, the treatment will continue for the foreseeable future.

More removal actions continued in 1998 including characterization of Lagoon 1 (and annex) for design/implementation of soil vapor extraction; long- term operation and maintenance at Lagoon 1; cleanup of stockpiled soil at Lagoon 1, and monitoring of Lagoon 1 and groundwater.

EPA also issued a document called an Explanation of Significant Differences in 2009 that updated the groundwater cleanup goals to Enforcement Standards under Wisconsin regulations.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA completed a five-year review of the National Presto Industries Superfund site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure that the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This was the fifth five-year review of this site.

The review concluded that the cleanup is protecting people and the environment.

EPA’s original cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater consisted of constructing a permanent water supply system, installing groundwater extraction wells, treating the extracted water using cascade aeration units, excavating waste forge compound, installing soil vapor extraction systems, removing soil/waste from ditches and dry wells, operating an air stripper that services two plumes pumping and treating contaminated groundwater, and monitoring.

The last 5 year review was completed in 2022.

### Emergency Response and Removal

NPI provided bottled water to 174 homes and 40 businesses in Hallie as a temporary measure in 1989. Site cleanup also included some short-term cleanups to address immediate threats to people and the environment.
