Background
The Des Moines TCE Superfund Site is located in south-central Des Moines, Iowa, on the east side of the Raccoon River. The site was operated by Dico, Inc. for approximately 40 years and is currently owned by the city of Des Moines. Dico's operations at the property included steel wheel manufacturing and chemical and pesticide formulation. Dico's operations at the site resulted in the release of trichloroethene (TCE), 1,2-dichloroethene (1,2-DCE), and vinyl chloride to the groundwater, residual pesticides and metals to shallow soils, and pesticides to buildings and soils on the southern end of the site and drainage areas. The site is divided into four operable units: OU1 - Groundwater TCE plume on the Dico property. OU2 - Originated as source soils associated with TCE groundwater contamination, but later focused on residual pesticides and metals in shallow soils. OU3 - A source area of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) groundwater contamination north of the Dico property. OU4 - Pesticides in buildings and soil on the southern end of the Dico property and in drainage areas of the Dico property. Degreasers containing TCE were used on-site during the manufacturing process of wheels and brakes. A large underground degreasing vat was located in a concrete containment pit inside Dico's main production building. Drums of TCE were also stored on a concrete slab along the western wall of the building. The degreasing vat leaked unknown quantities of TCE. The oily waste sludge from the degreasing vat were applied to the ground surface of the Dico property as a dust control measure. Dico also disposed of the sludge directly onto the ground and covered it with dirt. These waste disposal practices were reportedly discontinued around 1979. In addition, bulk chemical storage and distribution occurred on the Dico property. Dico received approximately 120,000 gallons per year of TCE between 1946 and 1980. At times, the TCE was delivered to Dico by railcar. Using an above-ground pipeline, the TCE was transferred from the railcars to a storage tank located near the southeast corner of the production building. Unknown amounts of TCE were spilled during the delivery and transfer operations. From the mid-1950s through the early 1970s, pesticide and herbicide formulation was conducted in Buildings 1 through 5 and in the Maintenance Building. The primary formulation activities were conducted in Buildings 2 and 3, while Buildings 4 and 5 were primarily used for chemical and product storage. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The remedy to clean the contaminated groundwater consists of a Groundwater Extraction and Treatment System. This system includes containing the contaminated groundwater so that it does not impact the north gallery of the nearby public water supply system, treating the groundwater with an air stripper to remove volatile organic compound (VOC) contamination, discharging treated water and operating extraction wells until water quality meets the regulatory standards for drinking water. This groundwater treatment system was constructed in December 1987 and was operated by Dico since that time until the city took ownership of the Dico property. As the current owners of the Dico property, the city will continue to conduct a groundwater monitoring program to evaluate changes in the contaminant plume and evaluate the effectiveness of the pump and treat system. Dico initially cleaned and encapsulated contaminated buildings and covered much of the property with an asphalt cap to reduce migration of surface soils and to prevent human contact with contaminated soils and building materials. Contaminated soils were also removed around the south pond and in an adjacent drainage ditch. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
In 2018, the EPA worked with other stakeholders at the site to perform an optimization study for the groundwater remedy to determine if changes should be made to the existing pump and treat system or if a different remedy may be more effective. Based on the results of this study, the age of the current system (one of the oldest in the country) and future plans to redevelop the property, the EPA determined that the existing system should be updated with a new lower profile system that will be more efficient at treating groundwater at the site. Installation of the new treatment system will be done in conjunction with future redevelopment plans to ensure the placement of the system will not hinder future use of the site. The replacement of the system is expected to occur in late 2024 or early 2025. In the meantime, the existing pump and treat system will continue to operate as designed. Other ongoing actions at the site include the continued maintenance of the asphalt cap to prevent exposures to contaminated soils beneath the cap. Buildings at the site were initially cleaned and encapsulated to prevent exposures to contaminated building materials; however, the buildings on site had not been used for some time and were starting to fall into disrepair. Although fencing at the site limited access to the building structures, to prevent the potential for future exposures, the EPA demolished and disposed of Buildings 1, 2 and 3, which contained contamination at levels that required encapsulation. This demolition began in June 2021 and was completed in October 2021. As part of preparing the site for future redevelopment, the city also completed demolition of the two remaining buildings located on the site in November 2021. The EPA also evaluated further actions to address pesticide contamination in the sediments at the south pond which were identified as posing a significant ecological risk. Cleanup activities to address this contamination was completed in the Fall of 2022 through dredging of sediments and backfilling. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Following the completion of response actions at the Dico property, contamination will remain at the property which may present an unreasonable risk to public health and the environment if certain activities occur on the property. As such, the EPA has determined that an Environment Covenant is necessary to manage the risk of future exposure by limiting specified activities at the property and establishing affirmative obligations. The property is subject to the following activity and use limitations:   1) The property may be used for non-residential purposes such as commercial or recreational uses. The property may also be used for multi-family residential purposes such as apartments or condominiums with prior EPA approval. However, the property must not be used for first-floor residential occupancy, such as single-family homes or duplexes, or daycare facilities, elder care facilities, nursing homes or hospitals;  2) Breaching of the asphalt cap and excavation of soils underneath the asphalt cap, or other subsurface work in the area underlaying the asphalt cap without prior EPA approval is restricted. Except in cases of emergency utility repair activities (such as a water or gas main break), any breach of the cap shall be approved in advance by the EPA.  After the EPA has approved any work activity that requires the breaching of the cap, the EPA shall be notified at least seven calendar days prior to the start of the approved excavation or subsurface work in the area underlying the asphalt cap. Any such work must provide for managing soils or other materials that are disturbed in a manner that minimizes risk to human health or the environment and shall be conducted in accordance with a previously EPA-approved materials management plan.  3) Groundwater at the property shall not be consumed or otherwise used for any purpose without prior approval by the EPA. Any additional proposed uses of the groundwater will require a written submittal by the Holder, or its transferee, detailing the use and a subsequent approval in writing from the EPA, after reasonable consultation with the IDNR. No new groundwater wells shall be installed at the property without the prior written approval of the EPA.  4) Groundwater monitoring and extraction wells and associated piping, pumps, structures and appurtenances comprising the groundwater remedy are present on the property. Grantor and its transferees shall not damage, interfere with, or remove these remedy components, or allow them to be damaged, interfered with, or removed, unless directed or approved by the EPA. These remedy components may be disturbed if necessary during an emergency (such as a water or gas main break, fire, explosion or natural disaster), in which case notification shall be provided to the EPA orally or in writing as soon as practicable, but no later than 72 hours after becoming aware of the disturbance. Within 30 days after such emergency has been abated, a written report shall be submitted to the EPA describing such emergency and any response actions taken and including a plan to restore all affected remedy components to their fully operational state.  5) To prevent or minimize exposures to soil gas vapors, any building or structure planned for human occupancy to be constructed on the property shall include an appropriate vapor barrier or vapor mitigation system. A copy of pre-construction plans and/or as-built documentation of barrier or mitigation systems must be submitted to the EPA. Preconstruction plans must be submitted 45 days prior to construction/as-built documentation must be provided 45 days following completion of construction. Vapor barrier or mitigation systems must be maintained as long as the human occupancy of buildings continue, so that the system continues to meet the intended function to protect human health from soil gas vapors.  If any person desires in the future to use the property for any purpose or in any manner that is prohibited by this Covenant, the EPA must be notified in advance. Further analyses and/or response actions may be required prior to any such use. Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
Dico conducted monthly sampling of the groundwater treatment system and biannual sampling of groundwater monitoring wells since the operation of the groundwater treatment system began in 1987. As the current owners of the property, the city will continue to perform the required sampling of the groundwater treatment system and associated groundwater monitoring wells.

Emergency Response and Removal
The EPA completed a time critical removal action in Fall 2022. This removal action involved consolidation and disposal of pond sediments and nearby soils containing hazardous substances found within a drainage area of the site referred to as the South Pond Area (SPA). The time critical removal action was necessary to address the threat to human health and the environment posed by hazardous substances in SPA sediments and surrounding soil. The time-critical removal action supports the planned redevelopment of the site for commercial and mixed-use.

Enforcement Information
After years of contentious litigation with Dico, Inc. and Titan Tire Corporation, a multi-party Consent Decree was negotiated and lodged on September 15, 2020. The settlement provides for the collection of $11.5 million from Dico/Titan, some of which will be used by the EPA to perform certain cleanup actions and resolves Dico/Titan’s liability at both the Des Moines TCE Site and the Southern Iowa Mechanical Site in Ottumwa, IA. Dico and Titan Tire are subsidiaries of Titan International, Inc., a large farm and off-road tire manufacturing company. The Des Moines TCE Site is the only asset of Dico, Inc.  Remedies have been in place since the mid-1990s and remaining contamination on-site includes TCE in groundwater, pesticides in soils (capped), pesticides and PCBs in delipidated buildings, and pesticides in pond sediments. Since the selection of the remedies in the 1990s, the site was shuttered by Dico and fell into disrepair.  Dico and Titan Tire contracted with Southern Iowa Mechanical for the demolition and disposal of some of the buildings at the Des Moines TCE site in violation of an EPA order. Parts of these buildings were taken to the SIM’s facility in Ottumwa, which resulted in contamination from the Des Moines TCE site being transferred to another property, creating a second Superfund site. In 2010, the United States brought an action in federal court alleging that Dico and Titan Tire had arranged for the disposal of the PCBs in the buildings. In a series of court decisions, the U.S. was awarded $7 million against Dico and Titan in reimbursement of the U.S.’s response costs.  The court also assessed against Dico a civil penalty of $1.6 million and $5.4 million in punitive damages, which was subsequently affirmed by the 8th Circuit in 2019. This series of case law is important precedent on the issue of arranger liability. In addition to the payment of $11.5M to the United States, the Consent Decree also provided for the transfer of property to the city of Des Moines. In exchange for the property, the city operates and maintains the existing CERCLA remedies and implement land use controls for the property. With approximately $2.6M of the settlement proceeds from Dico, the EPA agreed toperform certain work necessary to protect human health and the environment moving forward. Top of Page
