### Background

The 27-acre Oeser Company site is located in a mixed residential and industrial area of Bellingham, Washington. The owners have operated a wood-treating facility on site since 1943. Operations include preparing and treating wood poles for utility companies. Most of the site is used to store treated and untreated logs, with the wood-treating plant occupying 3 acres of the site. Site operations used creosote, which contains semi- [volatile organic compounds](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=VOC) (SVOCs), as a wood-treating preservative up until 1983 when the company switched to using an oil containing pentachlorophenol ( [PCP](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=semi-volatile+organic+compounds) ). Wood-treating operations resulted in soil and groundwater contamination. Following construction of the site’s long-term remedy, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

Restoration of nearshore habitat is a goal of the City of Bellingham. The City and other stakeholders have identified Little Squalicum Creek and beach area as a priority site for shoreline enhancement and restoration in Bellingham Bay.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Oeser Company has operated the 27-acre wood-treating facility since 1942. It primarily manufactures poles for utility companies. From approximately 1942 to 1984 the primary wood-treating chemical used by Oeser was creosote. Since 1984 wood poles have been treated with pentachlorphenol. The Site also encompasses the Little Squalicum Creek Area which includes a large portion of Little Squalicum Park. Little Squalicum Creek Area abuts the south side of the Oeser Wood Storage area.

The Site was listed on EPA’s National Priorities List on October 27, 1997. In 1998, 23,000 gallons of stored creosote was removed from the Oeser facility, as well as about 8500 tons of contaminated soil and 27,000 gallons of liquid waste. Areas of the Oeser facility were capped to prevent contact with remaining contaminated soils, and the Oeser facility was fenced. EPA assumed the lead in preparing the initial Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study for the Oeser Property portion of the Site, after attempts to negotiate an agreement with Oeser to conduct the work failed. EPA and its contractors completed the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study during the summer of 2002. This work included sampling air, groundwater, off-facility and on-facility soils, and surface water and sediment from Little Squalicum Creek.

The Record of Decision (ROD) for the Oeser Site was signed September 18, 2003. In 2005, Oeser entered into a Consent Decree with EPA to implement the remedial activities described in the ROD. The selected remedy included capping, excavation, institutional controls to limit groundwater use and non-industrial use, groundwater monitoring, and long-term maintenance of the caps at the Oeser facility. No action was selected for the Little Squalicum Creek Area. In 2006/2007, The Oeser Company capped on-site soils to eliminate workers’ exposure to soil contamination. In addition, two tanks containing excess creosote product from historic operations were drained, dismantled and disposed of. Repairs were also completed on a damaged storm drain.

Soil, sediment, surface water, and groundwater at the Little Squalicum Creek Area that contain chemicals that are associated with wood-treating operations were the subject of additional investigatory work conducted by both EPA and the City of Bellingham in 2008 and 2009. In 2010, EPA issued an Action Memorandum for a non time-critical removal action at the Little Squalicum Creek Area. Over 21,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil and sediment were excavated and removed from the Little Squalicum Creek Area. Excavated soil and sediment were transported to a repository created specifically for this material on the Oeser facility or to a regulated landfill. Excavated areas were backfilled with clean material and revegetated where necessary. Little Squalicum Creek was re-routed to flow through the historical channel and adjacent wetland areas were enhanced.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA issued a long-term cleanup plan in 2003. It included capping, excavation, institutional controls to limit groundwater use and non-industrial use, groundwater monitoring, and long-term maintenance of the caps.

**Cleanup Progress**

The Oeser Company completed a short-term removal action in 1998 to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. The removal included fencing the site; removal of stored creosote; capping; excavation and transportation of contaminated soil and liquid waste off the site; capping the area of soil excavation; and capping an area of dioxin-contaminated soil.

Between 2005 and 2007, Oeser constructed the site’s long-term remedy under an agreement with EPA. The City of Bellingham, pursuant to an agreement with the Washington State Department of Ecology and funds from an EPA grant, collected additional data in the Little Squalicum Creek area portion of the site. The City of Bellingham completed the investigation in 2009 and concluded that soil, groundwater, sediment and surface water in the area of Little Squalicum Creek contain contaminants, including [PCP](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=semi-volatile+organic+compounds) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( [PAHs](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=PAH) ), which are associated with stormwater drainage and wood-treating activities from Oeser.

EPA completed the site’s first Five-Year Review in 2011, and the second one in 2016. The reviews concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks are being controlled. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires finalizing institutional controls and an operation and maintenance plan for the site.

The [third Five-Year Review Report](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/10/100399714) is now available. EPA reviews Superfund sites every five years when contaminants remain on site to ensure that the cleanup continues to protect people’s health and the environment. The results of the review have found the cleanup remains protective of the environment and people’s health. The review identified two recommendations, which do not affect current and/or future protectiveness. The first is that Oeser will update the field sampling forms to explicitly capture details including the thickness of Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (examples of LNAPL are gasoline, home heating oil, and diesel fuel), the amount of water and LNAPL removed, and the thickness of LNAPL remaining after removal. The second recommendation is that EPA will continue to work with the city of Bellingham to ensure there is no exposure to waste left in place during estuary project.

### Emergency Response and Removal

In 2011, EPA completed a non-time-critical removal action at the Little Squalicum Creek Area. It included excavating contaminated soil and sediment from the Little Squalicum Creek Area and transporting to a material to a regulated landfill. Removal activities also included backfilling excavated areas with clean material and revegetating where necessary. Little Squalicum Creek was rerouted to flow through the historical channel and adjacent wetland areas were enhanced.
