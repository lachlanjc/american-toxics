### Background

The Spiegelberg Landfill site is located in Green Oak Township, Michigan. Disposal of domestic, industrial and septic waste materials took place on site from 1966 until about 1977. Sand, gravel and peat mining continue today. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2011.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. Because the site is no longer on the NPL, EPA will not conduct additional five-year reviews.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included excavation, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and contaminated soils as well as installation and operation of a groundwater treatment system. Construction of the remedy took place between 1989 and 1995. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2011.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

This site has been deleted from the NPL. The contaminants were lead and VOCs in the soil and groundwater.
