Background
The former operations of the Iron King Mine and the Humboldt Smelter led to wastes and contamination in soils, sediments, and surface drainages within the town of Dewey-Humboldt, Arizona.  EPA placed the Iron King Mine/Humboldt Smelter (IKHS) site on the Superfund list (the “National Priorities List”) in 2008. Between the early 1900s and about 1970, the former Iron King Mine mined rock ores of zinc, silver, lead, and gold.  Peak production was during the World War II era.  These operations left behind a pile of about four million cubic yards of orange mine tailings with high levels of arsenic and lead.  Tailings are a powdery waste that remains after the crushing and concentrating of mine ore.  In the past, some tailings dust has also blown toward the first ridge to the north from the mine.  Some of these tailings washed into the Chaparral Gulch and flowed downstream toward the Agua Fria River.  Today, tailings and sediment from the mountains continue to move with storm water.  The former mine property also contains many large piles of waste rock. Between the late 1800s and about 1937, the Humboldt Smelter and two earlier facilities crushed copper and lead ores and melted them in furnaces to make pure metal.  Peak production was during the earlier World War I era.  Almost all the smelter’s buildings were demolished and removed long ago.  During operations, lead and other metals were released from the smelter’s smoke stacks.  The former smelter property also contains large piles of dross, slag and soils contaminated with lead and other metals.  The slag is a rocky smelter waste, like solidified lava, that hangs over a cliff above the Agua Fria River.  The dross is a fine-grained, grey color waste that was imported by a metals reprocessing facility in the 1950s and 1960s, after the smelter closed.  Operations at the smelter property also produced crushed ore tailings that were dumped into a depression on the property. Historically, tailings from the Iron King Mine and Humboldt Smelter mixed together.  These mixed tailings lie in a flood plain within Chaparral Gulch below the smelter.  They are held back from entering the Agua Fria River by a dam in the canyon of lower Chaparral Gulch. An overview of the site can be viewed in a recorded presentation “A Look at the Site (with Photo Tour).”
EPA has conducted comprehensive investigations at the IKHS site to understand the nature and extent of site-related contamination and study risks to human health or the environment.  These efforts are called a remedial investigation.  Currently, EPA is completing a study of options to address the contamination, called a feasibility study.  .  The goal of EPA’s efforts is to select and implement a cleanup remedy that will protect human health and the environment.  This cleanup remedy will prevent human and wildlife exposure to tailings and other contamination, as well as permanently stabilize mine wastes so they no longer move or become exposed to water.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Record of Decision and Selection of Cleanup Option for the Site On October 20, 2023, EPA issued a record of decision to clean up the site.  The Record of Decision documents the cleanup option EPA has chosen after considering and responding to public comment.  In the next steps in the process, EPA will comprehensively design the cleanup action and then implement it.  The ROD includes a responsiveness summary to comments received.  The cleanup option selected by the ROD will address both the mining and smelting wastes in non-residential areas and additional residential properties affected by the site. More than 8 million tons of contaminated materials in non-residential areas also pose potential risks to human health and the environment.  These include the tailings pile, contaminated soil, and waste rock at the former Iron King Mine; the tailings, dross and other wastes at the former smelter; the tailings and contaminated sediments in the Chaparral Gulch; drainages, and open flood plain between the mine and smelter; and the dam holding back tailings.  In these non-residential areas, the cleanup will consolidate the mine and smelter wastes into two waste repositories.  A waste repository is a large, stable, permanently covered holding cell that encapsulates wastes, keeps water out, and prevents wastes from moving further into drainages or the river. Mine wastes and contaminated soils from the former mine and surrounding areas west of Highway 69 will be moved into a repository on the existing mine tailings pile. Wastes at the former smelter and in the Chaparral Gulch east of Highway 69 will be moved into a second waste repository, most likely in a natural depression on the former smelter property. Both repositories will be inspected periodically and maintained to ensure they remain intact and effective. Since 2008, EPA has continued to address the residential soil contamination by investigating almost 600 nearby homes with yards to identify which yards were impacted by the Superfund site. EPA then removed contaminated soil from the 47 homes where levels of lead or arsenic were high enough that exposure for long periods could pose a threat to human health and replaced it with clean soil. Since the initial residential cleanup, recent studies of the toxicity of these heavy metals now support the use of lower cleanup levels to be protective of human health. Therefore, EPA will address more residential properties as part of this cleanup. Contaminated soils will be excavated and replaced with clean soil. Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study of Cleanup Options  The Superfund process includes studying a contamination problem (called a remedial investigation), comparing cleanup options (called a feasibility study), selecting a cleanup remedy after public input, and designing and executing the cleanup remedy. The remedial investigation is a very important part of the Superfund process, because it informs the development of cleanup options and the decision on which option to select as the final cleanup remedy. It identifies where wastes and other contamination are located, how much is present, and whether there are risks to human health or the environment. This helps us understand the scale of cleanup needed and what kids of cleanup might be feasible. In 2016, EPA completed a three-volume Remedial Investigation Report (September 2016) for the Iron King Mine-Humboldt Smelter Superfund site.  This information is summarized in a recorded presentation "Defining the Problem: The Remedial Investigation." The remedial investigation for IKHS evaluated sampling data, technical analyses, and other information to define the nature and extent of contamination.  It addresses all areas of the site, including the tailings pile, contaminated soil, and waste rock at the former Iron King Mine; the tailings, dross and other wastes at the former Humboldt Smelter; the tailings and contaminated sediments in the Chaparral Gulch, drainages, open flood plains between the mine and smelter; residential properties, and other areas. In October 2022, EPA completed a study of cleanup options for non-residential waste areas – including the mine tailings, the mine, the smelter property, and the dam in the lower Chaparral Gulch. This study is called a feasibility study. These efforts are further described above under the "What Is the Current Site Status" section and summarized in a recorded presentation called "Options for Cleanup: The Feasibility Study."  The remedial investigation and the feasibility study were used as a basis for the record of decision discussed above. In some cases, EPA can perform short-term cleanups (called removal actions) to address parts of the site. Removal actions are typically done when the conditions are simpler, more urgent, and usually less costly than addressing the entire site.  EPA used removal actions to cleanup yard soils in residential areas.  Cleanup in Residential Areas One objective of EPA’s remedial investigation was to understand whether residential yards within Dewey-Humboldt had been contaminated by former emissions from the smelter stack, wind-blown tailings from the mine and the smelter, or spills from rail loading areas over many years in the past.    Arsenic and lead occur naturally in soils in the Dewey-Humboldt area.  So, EPA first conducted extensive sampling to understand levels of arsenic and lead we expect to see in absence of site contamination.  This information helped us target areas in Dewey-Humboldt that the mine or smelter could have contaminated.  That area is where we focused our yard sampling efforts.  (For a complete discussion on defining the area of potential site impact, refer to Appendix E: Soil Background Study of the Remedial Investigation report.) At the end of a thorough investigation of about 600 residential yards, EPA found about 47 properties with lead or arsenic in surface yard soils at high enough levels to pose an unacceptable long-term health risk.  EPA prioritized the cleanup of residential yards because people may come into direct contact with yard soils on a regular basis.  Additionally, homeowners needed contamination issues at their properties promptly resolved.  EPA performed three cleanup actions for residential yards – 6 yards in 2006-2007, 13 yards in 2011-2012, and 31 yards in 2017.  In these cleanup actions, EPA excavated and disposed of contaminated surface soil and replaced it with clean soil.  For more information, see EPA Completes Soil Cleanup in Residential Yards factsheet from August 2017 or the recorded presentation "Residential Investigation and Cleanup." Dust Stabilizationat the Former Smelter Property In late 2019, EPA took actions to control dust from the smelter property.  Community members had informed EPA that during periods of high winds, dross dust was being blown into neighborhood areas.  EPA applied a stabilizing cover material called Posi-Shell® on top of the contaminated dross material on the ground surface of the north end of the smelter property.  The Posi-Shell® forms a hard, thick crust over the dross.  This effort is designed to control dust until EPA can select and implement a final cleanup remedy to address the contamination.  In June 2020, February 2021, and September 2021, EPA inspected the Posi-Shell® covering and determined it is in good shape. Fencing and Signage at the Former Smelter and Mine Properties EPA wantes to keep people away form the former Iron King Mine property and the former Humboldt Smelter property. In October 2019, EPA issues a news brief and a fact sheet to warn community members to stay away from these properties. In September 2020, we issued another fact sheet asking parents to talk with their children about staying away from these dangerous properties. In 2019-2020, EPA placed many additional warning signs on or near these properties. All signs warn of toxic hazards and some also warn of unstable structures. Over 40 small warning signs are at or near the former smelter property and over 20 small warning signs are along the fence on the Iron King Road side of the former mine property. We also placed 10 larger warning signs around both of the properties and in contaminated areas of the Chaparral Gulch. In 2019-2020, EPA also worked to better restrict access at both proprties. We placed fencing at the former smelter property and added barbed wire to the front gate. We worked with the owner of the former mine property to upgrade and add fencing around the mine tailings pile. While fending and signs cannot fully eliminate access to these properties, these efforts aim to deter people who may be unaware of the toxic and structural hazards. EPA's efforts to control dust, add fencing, and place additional warning signs are summarized in the recorded presentation "Interim Dust Control, Fencing, and Signs." Top of Page

On October 20, 2023, EPA issued a record of decision to clean up the site.  The Record of Decision documents the cleanup option EPA has chosen after considering and responding to public comment.  In the next steps in the process, EPA will comprehensively design the cleanup action and then implement it.  The ROD includes a responsiveness summary to comments received.  The cleanup option selected by the ROD will address both the mining and smelting wastes in non-residential areas and additional residential properties affected by the site.

Therefore, EPA will address more residential properties as part of this cleanup.  Contaminated soils will be excavated and replaced with clean soil. These efforts are summarized in a recorded presentation "Options for Cleanup: The Feasibility Study." The next step is for EPA to complete a Proposed Plan. The Proposed Plan summarizes the information about the site and describes the cleanup options to address the contamination. Additionally, in the Proposed Plan, EPA identifies the preferred remedy (or way to address the contamination). The Proposed Plan is an opportunity to discuss the cleanup options with the community and for the community to provide feedback to EPA. Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
EPA’s evaluation of sampling data and other information to define the nature and extent of contamination in all areas of IKHS is described above under the "What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?" section of this webpage. The remedial investigation included sampling of wastes, soils, sediments, surface water and groundwater across the IKHS site.  It included thousands of surface soil samples.  It also included soil samples at different depths from hundreds of borings that help us understand where wastes and other contamination are under the ground.  EPA installed and sampled 27 groundwater monitoring wells and sampled privately owned water supply wells to assess whether the IKHS site is affecting groundwater quality.  We also evaluated water and sediment samples from the Agua Fria River and Chapparal Gulch. The information on the remedial investigation can be found in EPA's Remedial Investigation Report (September 2016). EPA also summarized these efforts in the recorded presentation series "Defining the Problem: The Remedial Investigation."
In residential areas of Dewey-Humboldt, EPA evaluated about 600 residential yards.  EPA focused yard sampling efforts in areas the mine or smelter could have contaminated by blown tailings or previous smelter stack emissions.  (The method EPA used to define this area is explained in Appendix E: Soil Background Study of the Remedial Investigation report.)  In these areas, EPA took 10-20 surface soil samples across each property to analyze in the laboratory and/or with an X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer device. EPA's investigation and cleanup efforts in the residential areas is further described in the "What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site" section.

Emergency Response and Removal
In some cases, EPA can perform short-term cleanups (called removal actions) to address parts of the site, when the conditions are typically simpler, more urgent, and usually less costly than addressing the entire site.  EPA used a removal action to cleanup yard soils in residential areas, which is discussed above in the "What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?" section of this webpage. In late 2019, EPA used a removal action to control dust, place fencing at the smelter property, and place warning signs on or near the former mine and smelter properties. Top of Page
Enforcement Information
Potentially responsible parties (PRPs) refers to entities that are potentially liable under the Superfund law to pay for and/or perform investigation and cleanup of the site.  EPA can take enforcement actions, such as issuing orders, to secure cleanup from PRPs.  PRPs may include current landowners as well as parties who were landowners or were operating the industrial facilities when contaminants were released to the environment.  PRPs may also include parties responsible for generating, transporting, or disposing of the hazardous substances.  If the original PRPs have corporate parents or successors, these also can be PRPs.
EPA has conducted a search for PRPs for the IKHS site.  EPA has issued letters to multiple parties advising them of their status as PRPs under the Superfund law.  EPA is continuing its civil investigation into which parties may be liable for site contamination.
