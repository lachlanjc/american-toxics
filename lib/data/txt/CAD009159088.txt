### Background

The TRW Microwave, Inc. (Building 825) site is one of three sites contributing contamination to a groundwater plume in Sunnyvale, California. Former microwave manufacturing and semiconductor processing activities contaminated groundwater and soil with volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

The former TRW Microwave Superfund Site (TRW Site), part of the “Triple Site” in Sunnyvale, California, is located at 825 Stewart Drive and neighbors multiple other sites, including: the Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Buildings 901/902 Thompson Place Superfund Site (AMD 901/902 Site), the AMD 915 De Guigne Drive Superfund Site (AMD 915 Site), the Philips Semiconductors Site (Philips Site; formerly Signetics Inc.), which includes the properties at 811 Arques Avenue, 440 North Wolfe Road, and facilities along Stewart Drive, and the Mohawk Laboratories Site. A groundwater plume composed of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including trichloroethene (TCE), extends from these sites more than a mile north in Sunnyvale to beyond Highway 101.  
  
The TRW Site, together with three other operable units (OUs), was covered by a 1991 Record of Decision for the Triple Site, all located in Sunnyvale. The four OUs for the Triple Site are as follows:

(1) The AMD 901/902 Site OU;  
(2) The Philips Site OU;  
(3) The TRW Site OU; and  
(4) The Companies Offsite Operable Unit (OOU), a commingled plume of contaminants which originated from the other three operable units (and has contributions from other sites in the area).

At the time of adoption of the 1991 Record of Decision, the OOU was defined as a 100-acre area, downgradient and north of the Triple Site in an area bounded by the Sunnyvale East Drainage Channel on the west and Santa Paula Ave. on the east, and as the area inside a 5 micrograms per liter (µg/L) contour for trichloroethene (TCE) in groundwater. Over 400 residences and at least 4 schools are present within the OOU.  
  
The TRW Site was occupied by Aertech Industries from 1968 until it was sold to TRW Inc (TRW) in 1974. In 1987, TRW sold the facility to FEI Microwave, Inc. In 1993, FEI Microwave stopped production and in 1995 the site was acquired by Stewart Associates and leased to research and development companies until 2001. The exterior of the building was remodeled between 2001 and 2003, including demolition of part of the existing structure and construction of a new two-story building. In December 2002, TRW merged with Northrop Grumman. In 2004, the property was purchased by Pacific Landmark, and then by Hines in 2014 and then GI Partners, the current owner, in 2016. During these changes in site ownership, TRW and then Northrop Grumman retained responsibility for site cleanup.  
  
The primary activity at the TRW Site was assembling and testing microwave components until semiconductor processing began in 1970. Primarily solvents and small quantities of acids were used in the assembly areas for semiconductors. Solvents, acids, and heavy metals were used in the fabrication areas and plating shop. The paint shop used paints and solvents.  
  
Acid rinse water generated by the assembly processes was neutralized on-site and discharged to the City of Sunnyvale sewer system. An underground ammonia gas acid neutralization system was installed when the facility first opened. Floor drains and acid sinks in the plating shop were connected to buried plumbing that carried acid waste to the neutralization system. This system was closed in 1986, and the underground piping was sealed. The system was replaced with three aboveground tanks. Spent solvents were stored in one of four on-site underground tanks. After 1982, solvents were stored in drums and transported off-site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Initial Actions

Four spent solvent underground tanks, along with some soil, were removed in 1973, 1976, 1980, and 1983. In 1984, 120 cubic yards of contaminated soil were excavated and transported to an EPA-approved hazardous waste facility. The site was backfilled to the surface with gravel and concrete was poured over the gravel to prevent rainwater from seeping into the pit. TRW installed and operated a soil vapor extraction (SVE) system in the vicinity of the former source area excavation from 1993 to 1998. Testing indicated that no further soil remediation was necessary and the SVE system was removed in 1998.  
  
The gravel pit created during the initial source area excavations became part of a groundwater extraction system operated by TRW between 1985 and 2001 to clean up the on-site groundwater and prevent VOCs from migrating off-site. Extracted groundwater was treated by an air stripper and then discharged to Calabasas Creek. In 2000 and 2001, pumps in the groundwater extraction wells were turned off to allow for initiation of enhanced anaerobic bioremediation (EAB) in the former site source area. Based on groundwater testing that showed improved groundwater conditions, the groundwater extraction system was shut down.

Cleanup Ongoing

EAB was initially implemented in 2000 and has been ongoing in an effort to reduce contaminant concentrations at the TRW Site. Multiple injections of different EAB substrates have been performed in and immediately downgradient of the former site source area since 2000.

In 1984, the State issued an order requiring AMD, Philips, and TRW to develop a joint plan to prevent further migration of contaminants. New orders in 1989 required TRW to submit an investigation and proposed cleanup plan with AMD and Philips. In 1991, the State and EPA issued a combined Record of Decision for TRW and the surrounding AMD and Philips sites. The companies installed off-site extraction wells to prevent migration of the VOC-impacted groundwater north of Highway 101. The extracted groundwater is treated at the Philips on-site treatment system.

The TRW Site, together with the AMD 901/902 Thompson Place Site and the Philips (formerly Signetics) Site, were transferred back to EPA from the State of California in August 2014. Since that time EPA has been overseeing the ongoing environmental investigation and cleanup activities at the Site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Cleanup Results to Date

The removal of tanks and contaminated soil have reduced the potential for exposure to contaminated materials at the TRW Site. Groundwater extraction and subsequent bioremediation activities have significantly reduced and/or eliminated pollutants in groundwater at the site, and ongoing groundwater sampling indicates that bioremediation processes are continuing to have a beneficial effect.

EPA began indoor air sampling in the adjacent neighborhood in late 2015 and has sampled over 250 homes and classrooms, certain of which have showed unacceptable levels of TCE vapor intrusion. Twenty mitigation systems in residences and school buildings have been installed, and outreach and sampling continues.

EPA’s Sixth Five-Year Review was completed in 2024. The Sixth Five-Year Review concluded that the remedy at the TRW Site currently protects human health and the environment because exposure pathways for soil and groundwater that could result in unacceptable risks are prevented through a land use covenant and agreement. There is no evidence of unacceptable vapor intrusion risk for the current commercial buiding on-site. However, in order for the remedy to be protective in the long-term, EPA should select a revised groundwater remedy for the TRW Site, as the groundwater extraction and treatment system, a key element of the remedy selected in the 1991 Record of Decision, is no longer onsite. The revised remedy should also address vapor intrusion in the event of future land use changes, as vapor intrusion evaluation was limited in the 1991 Recrod of Decision.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Removal actions, or short-term cleanups, included the removal of four spent solvent underground tanks, excavation and transport of contaminated soils, backfilling of excavated areas and pouring of concrete over the backfilled area for waterproofing. Since 1985, seven on-site extraction wells have prevented VOCs from migrating off site. An air stripper treats groundwater before treated water is discharged to Calabasas Creek.
