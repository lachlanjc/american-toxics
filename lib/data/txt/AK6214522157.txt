### Background

The 56,000-acre Fort Richardson (USARMY) site is located in Anchorage, Alaska. Past site activities and waste management practices at the site included discharging used oils, solvents and fuel spills to the floor drains, which ultimately discharged to subsurface soils; mixing spent solvents with contaminated fuel and waste oil; burning waste oil, solvent and contaminated fuel at fire burn pits for fire training practice; burying munitions and hazardous chemicals; and storing waste oil in underground storage tanks. These activities contaminated soil, sediment, groundwater and surface water with hazardous chemicals. Remedy construction is complete at some site areas. The Army is currently performing investigations at remaining site areas to assess the nature and extent of contamination and identify appropriate cleanup options.

The Army constructed the installation in 1940. During World War II, the Army used the fort to defend Alaska against foreign invaders. Its current mission is to command and control Army forces in Alaska. Fort Richardson provides the services, facilities and infrastructure to support and train rapid deployment forces from Alaska to the Pacific theater.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state and federal actions.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy at OUB requires re-evaluation of contaminant of concern (COC) remedial action objectives (RAOs) to consider current toxicity information; and definition of the downgradient extent of the contaminated groundwater plume. EPA deferred making a protectiveness statement for OUE until additional information can be obtained through a vapor intrusion assessment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The U.S. Army signed a Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) with EPA and the state in 1994 to address site contamination. EPA has divided the site into several operable units (OUs) in order to better address site contamination. The site’s long-term remedy includes treating hot spots of contaminated soil and groundwater with high-vacuum extraction (HVE); extracting and treating some contaminated groundwater; allowing natural attenuation of groundwater contaminants outside the hot spot areas; groundwater monitoring; and land use controls. Cleanup actions also include treating contaminated sediment; minimizing wetland disturbance; applying cap-and-fill material in specific ponded areas; performing aerial photography, habitat mapping, telemetry monitoring and aerial surveys; evaluating waterfowl mortality and monitoring cap-and-fill integrity. Remedy construction began in 1999 and is ongoing.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included early cleanup and removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. These actions included removing chemical agent storage containers and associated materials; excavating contaminated soil; dredging channels to remove white phosphorus-contaminated sediment; draining of ponds; and placing bentonite barriers to prevent ingestion of contaminants.
