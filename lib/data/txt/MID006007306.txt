### Background

The Allied Paper Inc./Portage Creek/Kalamazoo River Superfund Site is located in Allegan and Kalamazoo Counties, Michigan. The site includes soil and sediments contaminated by a group of chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, within 80 miles of the Kalamazoo River. The area includes from Morrow Dam to Lake Michigan, paper mill properties, riverbanks and floodplains, and a 3-mile stretch of Portage Creek. EPA has broken down the site into six segments, or operable units, referred to as OUs, that require cleanup. The six OUs are as follows:

- OU 1: Allied Paper Property/Bryant Mill Pond Area
- OU 2: Willow Boulevard and A-Site Landfill
- OU 3: King Highway Landfill
- OU 4: 12th Street Landfill
- OU 5: Portage Creek and Kalamazoo River sediments
- OU 7: Plainwell Mill

Five of the OUs are considered source OUs, meaning they historically contributed to (i.e., were sources of), the river’s contamination. So far, cleanup has taken place at three of the five source Ous. EPA conducts maintenance activities and monitors underground water sources, or groundwater, at these locations. For the remaining OUs that were a source of contamination to the river, interim actions have been taken to stop contamination to the river and cleanup decisions have occurred to address what remains.

OU5 includes 80 miles of the Kalamazoo River and 3 miles of Portage Creek. Because OU5 is so large and complex, it has been divided into seven areas. Each area is separated by dams and requires its own cleanup. EPA has decided on cleanup plans for two of the seven areas in addition to taking interim actions throughout Kalamazoo River and Portage Creek to protect human health and the environment.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Since 1998, EPA has removed nearly **660,000 cubic yards**  of contaminated material from the site, cleaned up and restored  nearly **11 miles** of the Kalamazoo River and its banks, and capped **82 acres** worth of contaminated material to lock it away.

EPA is working with its partners at the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, or EGLE, and the potentially responsible parties accountable for the contamination to clean up the site and eliminate PCBs from entering the Kalamazoo River. Under the law, EPA can require the potentially responsible parties, or PRPs, to pay for the cleanup. EPA and the PRPs have entered into several legal agreements wherein the PRPs will either reimburse EPA for cleaning up the site or conduct cleanup activities with EPA oversight. While work is being done, the state of Michigan has posted fish advisory signs along the Kalamazoo River warning people about the risks of eating fish from the river.

During the cleanup, there are two EPA programs working in tandem: the Remedial Program and the Removal Program. The Remedial Program addresses contamination that does not pose an immediate threat to public health or the environment. The cleanups are very thorough, require lots of planning, and move from upstream to downstream. The Removal Program addresses contamination that poses an immediate threat to human or environmental health. Removal actions target contamination “hot spots” throughout the site. Typically, removals are implemented based upon information obtained by the Remedial Program. Once the removal action is complete, the Remedial Program will address the remaining cleanup required in a particular section of the river.

The site is very large and complex and has been broken down into smaller pieces called operable units or OUs. EPA and EGLE have cleaned up four of the six OUs so far. These are OU2: Willow Boulevard and A-Site Landfill; OU3: King Highway Landfill; OU4: 12th Street Landfill; and the soil at OU7: Plainwell Mill. The agencies monitor OUs 2, 3, 4, and 7 to ensure the cleanups continue to protect human health and the environment.

EPA started cleanup of OU1: Allied Paper Landfill in 2021 and expects to complete it in 2026. These cleanups will make sure the contamination in those locations does not move into the Kalamazoo River or Portage Creek.

OU5: Portage Creek and Kalamazoo River sediments is the largest of the operable units and consists of 80 miles of the Kalamazoo River. Because of its size and complexity, OU5 was subdivided into seven Areas – EPA has decided on cleanup plans for two of the seven Areas. The Agency has also taken interim actions, which are measures taken to reduce the release of contamination that threatens human and environmental health before EPA chooses the final cleanup plan.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

#### Work continues at Allied Paper Landfill (OU1)

Work began in June 2021 at the Allied Paper Landfill to clean up polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, at the Allied Paper Inc./Portage Creek/Kalamazoo River Superfund site. In 2023, International Paper, or IP, took over the cleanup of the site with EPA oversight. The current owners of the site, the Lyondell Environmental Custodial Trust, had implemented the cleanup until that time. Heavy equipment will continue entering and exiting the site as work continues this summer. EPA and IP will continue to work with the city of Kalamazoo to manage traffic entering and leaving the site. EPA anticipates the construction of the new landfill to take three more years. The city of Kalamazoo expects to take over ownership of the property after the remedy is complete.

#### Work Is Complete Downstream of The Paterson Street Bridge, Verburg Park and Trail Now Open

Sediment cleanup was completed within Verburg Park Pond and adjacent portions of the Kalamazoo River in 2022 and restoration of Verburg Park was completed in October 2023. The park and trail are open for public use. See [EPA’s video about Verburg Park](https://youtu.be/85y2dd7O7NM?si=jCt-7yegGnFqi7Pw). Under EPA oversight, Georgia-Pacific LLC and International Paper Company conducted additional cleanup activities in 2023 and 2024. This included PCB-contaminated sediment dredging downstream of the Paterson Street Bridge. Sediment dredging was completed in April 2024, and the area will be restored in summer 2024. Approximately 73,000 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated sediment has been excavated from 2022 through 2024. EPA continues to coordinate with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.

#### Area 2 Design Sampling Continues

As part of a 2020 Consent Decree, NCR Corporation is completing the cleanup according to EPA’s 2017 Record of Decision, or ROD. NCR’s contractor has been conducting sampling to help design the cleanup for Area 2. This summer GEI will be doing additional sampling to get more information to support dam removal and restoration of the Kalamazoo River channel.

#### Area 3 Amendment to Consent Decree Approved

A consent decree amendment, [Agreed Modification of Consent Decree with NCR Corporation #9 Edited by the Court - Civil Action No 1:19-Cv-01041-Rjj-Rsk (pdf](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/986299) ) (362 K), was approved in Fall 2023 to require the potentially responsible party, NCR Corporation, to complete the cleanup of the riverbank and floodplain soil and sediment per EPA’s 2022 ROD. To learn more about this year's work, read [EPA Fact Sheet, Work Begins In Area 3 of the Kalamazoo River (pdf)](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/988568) (596.34 K). EPA will oversee the work and estimates NCR’s cleanup costs at $34 million. NCR’s contractor, GEI, will conduct sampling as part of the floodplain soil cleanup in late summer 2024.

#### PCB Cleanup to Begin Near Trowbridge Dam

EPA is working with NCR VOYIX, previously NCR, Michigan Department of Natural Resources, and Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to remove PCB-contaminated sediment and soil along the Kalamazoo River near the Trowbridge Dam in Trowbridge Township. The work will take place upstream of the Trowbridge Dam. The project is very complex and may take three or more years to complete. This important work to remove contaminated sediment and stabilize riverbanks will help prevent future contamination and erosion, improve water quality, and reduce contamination in fish.

EPA continues with access road construction on the north side of the river from the Lynx Golf Course to the dam. Through the summer, crews will be clearing land and preparing a staging area for equipment and materials near the 26th Street boat launch. Later this year, sheet pile will be installed along the riverbanks, and it is expected that dredging of contaminated sediments will begin. Construction of a temporary water control structure to manage river levels during the cleanup is also expected to begin. EPA plans to remove the water control structure and the remaining structures of the dam at the end of the project. EPA expects the river will remain open to recreation for the majority of 2024, but a notice will be provided months in advance of any restrictions or closures.

#### Area 5 Report Coming in Fall And Area 6 Sampling To Continue In 2025

Georgia-Pacific completed the sampling to determine the nature and extent of contamination within Area 5, and summarized this in the Remedial Investigation Report, which was approved by EPA in 2023. Georgia-Pacific’s contractor, WSP, submitted an Alternative Screening Technical Memorandum (ASTM) in December 2023 to review different cleanup technologies for the EPA. The Agencies provided comments on the ASTM, and it is anticipated that WSP will submit a Feasibility Study report – which details possible cleanup options – in the fall of 2024.

In Area 6, Georgia-Pacific’s contractor WSP is sampling to determine the nature and extent of PCB contamination. Some sampling was completed in 2023 and additional sampling of sediment, soil and surface water is expected to be done during the summer of 2025.

#### Plainwell Mill (OU7)

EPA signed a Record of Decision for the former Plainwell Paper Mill in September 2015. The selected cleanup plan requires the excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil from the former mill site. The Remedial Design was finalized in April 2018 and the cleanup work for soil was completed in Fall 2022.
