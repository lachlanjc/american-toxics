### Background

The Site is south of the city of Donna, Texas near the United States border with Mexico. The Site includes the 400-acre Donna Reservoir and a system of lateral lined and unlined canals and piping. The system extends north from the Rio Grande River about 17 miles; lateral canals extend about 5.6 miles east and west. The Site is operated by the Donna Irrigation District Hidalgo County Number One (Irrigation District), which provides drinking water to the city of Donna and the North Alamo Water Supply Corporation plant. The Irrigation District also provides irrigation water for the surrounding predominantly agricultural land.  
The Irrigation District pumps surface water into the canal system from the Rio Grande River through five pipes about one mile downstream from Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The volume and velocity of water entering the canal system and reservoirs can be controlled by the number of operational pumps. The water enters the Donna Main Canal and travels north by gravity flow for about two miles until it reaches the siphon. The siphon is a 1,600-foot-long and 9-foot inner diameter concrete pipeline that runs under the Arroyo Colorado River. After passing through the siphon, water flows in an unlined earthen canal (Lower West Main Canal Unlined) before it reaches a concrete-lined channel (Lower West Main Canal Line) that conveys water 1.75 miles north to the reservoir.  
onna Reservoir is a system of reservoirs with an average depth of five feet; it stores up to 390 million gallons of water. The reservoir system includes East, West, and Northwest segments. A lined canal flows directly into the West Reservoir; water then flows into the East Reservoir through two conduits under South Valley View Road. This road divides the East and West Reservoir segments. Fish in the Donna Reservoir and associated canals are contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The likely source of contamination at the Site was determined to be the existing siphon and the contaminated sediment located downstream of the siphon’s exit at the time of the ROD. The contaminated sediment was removed during the remedial action in 2020. Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) maintains a fishing restriction on the canal and river system (Aquatic Life Order Number 9), which prohibits taking aquatic life from the area. However, fishing and the consumption of fish from the Site still occurs.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal response actions. The remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) and the Proposed Plan for the site has been completed by the EPA.The nature and extent of contamination has been determined including the risks posed to human health and ecological receptors.

Sediment Remediation of the Site started in January of 2020 and was completed in May of 2020. . Over 24,788 tons of contaminated sediment was excavated and taken to an approved offsite landfill. Over 127,000 gallons of water that was drained from the sediment was treated and returned to the canal. The banks of the canal were also restored and reinforced with rock aggregate. Final closeout on the sediment remediation was completed in November 2020.

The EPA first detected PCBs in 1993 from the fish in Donna Canal. As a result, a fish possession ban was placed on the reservoir and canal system by the Texas Department of State Heatlh Services. However, people continue to catch and consume the contaminated fish. Access to the canal and reservoir system is not restricted. Signs have been placed along the system notifying the public of the contaminated fish.

The site was listed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in March 2008 due to PCB contamination in sediment and fish. The contamination source was not identified and the nature and extent of contamination were not fully delineated at the time of the EPA’s listing of the Site on the NPL.

In January 2020, EPA initiated remedial action construction for sediment. Sediment removal was conducted in accordance with the 2018 ROD and 2019 Statement of Work. Sediment was removed via mechanical dredging, then dewatered and stabilized prior to off-site disposal. The total dredged volume was estimated to be 13,779.45 cubic yards. About 127,000 gallons of water drained from the sediment was treated at a temporary water treatment system and returned to the canal. The banks of the canal were restored and reinforced with rock aggregate. Geotechnical investigations and slope stability analysis were completed during the remedial design. The embankments within the remediation area showed significant signs of sloughing and erosion prior to the remediation activities and the removal of sediment presented long-term stability concerns.  
Confirmation samples were collected at random locations in the sediment removal area. Samples were collected in four intervals, 0.0 feet to 0.5 feet, 0.5 feet to 1.0 feet, 1.0 feet to 1.5 feet, and 1.5 feet to 2.0 feet. The first interval, 0.0 feet to 0.5 feet, was analyzed for total PCBs; if results were above the cleanup level of 0.043 mg/kg, the second interval was tested. Out of 47 samples, all first interval samples were well below the cleanup level; therefore, the second, third, and fourth intervals were not analyzed. The sediment remedial action final inspection occurred in June 2020. The Remedial Action Completion Report was finalized in November 2020.

  
Fish Removal

  
The first fish removal after the ROD was completed in January 2020. Fish removals are done by electroshocking in coordination with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Annual post-ROD fish removals were conducted in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. Five fish removals have been conducted post-ROD. The ROD allows for continued fish removals based on attainment of the fish tissue remediation goal, removing them from the system if they still present a risk to the public. EPA plans to conduct fish removals as needed going forward and will evaluate removal methods and frequency.

  
Siphon Replacement

  
Replacement of the siphon has been delayed, allowing for evaluation of the siphon as a continuing source of PCBs to the system. The siphon is over 100 years old and may have been repaired in the 1960s with materials that contain PCBs. While evidence supports the siphon being the likely source, this has not been confirmed. If the siphon is the source, PCBs present may have been depleted over time. Although sampling inside the siphon is difficult due to logistics and safety issues, EPA plans to further evaluate the siphon in 2025 or 2026. This sampling event will involve sampling of water column and sediments before and after the siphon and attempts to sample within the siphon. In addition, EPA will continue to monitor fish tissue and sediment to determine if PCB concentrations decrease or if evidence supports replacement of the siphon is needed.

  
Public Outreach and Education

  
Aa In February 2017, EPA issued the Community Involvement Plan, which outlines public outreach implemented before the ROD. This outreach included community fact sheets, public meetings, No Fishing notices, radio and television public service announcements, warning signs, site tours with the community, and public interviews. Warning signs are replaced every year during fish removal activities. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in person outreach was limited. EPA conducted virtual meetings with University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) in November 2021, December 2022, November 2023, and November 2024. EPA also did a virtual meeting with the local community group ARISE Adelante (A Resource In Serving Equality moving forward) in September 2022. On February 1, 2024, EPA and TCEQ representatives conducted a public meeting to update the community on site activities. Subsequent to the community meeting, EPA participated in a community fair, Day of the Child, to reach the most sensitive subpopulations at risk of PCB exposure. Where possible all public outreach activities for this site are conducted in English and Spanish. A coordinated public outreach program will be developed in 2025

.  
Post-Remediation Site Monitoring

  
Current monitoring activities include collection and analysis of fish tissue and sediment. Fish tissue and sediment samples are collected during the fish removal process. Data is avalible in the Fish removal reports.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The RI/FS and Proposed Plan for the Site was completed in 2016. The Record of Decision (ROD) for the Site was issued in September 2018. The Remedial Design for sediment remediation was completed in 2019. The Remedial Action for sediment was compleated in 2020. Over 24,788 tons of contaminated sediment was removed from the canal system and taken to an approved offsite landfill. Over 127,000 gallons of water that was drained from the sediment was treated and returned to the canal. The banks of the canal were also restored and reinforced with rock aggregate. Final closeout on the sediment remediation was completed in November 2020.

The first fish removal after the ROD was completed in January 2020. Fish removals are done by electroshocking in coordination with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Annual post-ROD fish removals were conducted in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. Five fish removals have been conducted post-ROD. The ROD allows for continued fish removals based on attainment of the fish tissue remediation goal, removing them from the system if they still present a risk to the public. EPA plans to conduct fish removals as needed going forward and will evaluate removal methods and frequency.

The replacement of the siphon has been delayed due to concerns that it may not continue to be a significant source of PCBs. The current plan is to evaluate PCB concentrations in sediment and fish tissue after sediment remediation to determine if replacement of the siphon is still required.

The assessment of the Site during the first five-year review is that the remedy is not currently protective because fish continue to be removed for possible consumption from canals and the Donna Reservoir despite sampling results that indicate polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in fish tissue exceed remediation goals. The remedy implementation is ongoing and is anticipated be protective once the remedy is complete.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The Texas Department of Health (TDH) issued “Aquatic Life Order Number 9” on February 4, 1994. T his order stated that “... the Donna Irrigation System located in Hidalgo County is declared a prohibited area for the taking of all species of aquatic life.” According to a sign posted by the TDH at Donna Lake there is a $500 fine for the possession of fish from the Site. This sign also states that “Warning, it is illegal to possess fish from this water, fish caught from this water may contain harmful chemicals.” Signs warning the public about the contaminted fish have also been placed by the EPA and the Irrigation District at various locations near the reservoir and canal system.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Environmental data was collected as a part of the RI/FS. This data was used by the EPA to determine the nature and extent of contamination at the site and risks posed to human health and ecological receptors. Additional sediment sampling was done as part of the remedial design and durring the sediment remediation to confirm that remedial goals were achived. Sediment and fish tissue sampling will be done at each of the five scheduled fish removals and the results will be included in the anual fish removal reports.

### Emergency Response and Removal

The EPA conducted fish removal actions in August 2008, February 2009, August 2009, October 2012, and June 2017. These removal actions were conducted through the authority of “Action Memorandums” which stated that “Actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants from this site, if not addressed by implementing the response action selected in this Action Memorandum, may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health, welfare, or the environment.”

These fish removal actions involved the removal of several species of fish from the Site (i.e., alligator gar, freshwater drum, common carp, small mouth buffalo, channel catfish, large/small mouth bass, white bass, blue tilapia, shad, and eel, including other species of fish). The purpose of the fish removal actions was to remove fish, from the reservoir and canal system, possibly contaminated with PCBs and which were available for human consumption. These removal actions also created a public awareness campaign which spread the EPA’s following message to the public through newspaper and television media: “Do not eat the fish caught from the Site because they may contain chemicals (i.e., PCBs) that may cause cancer and other health effects.”

These fish removal actions coordinated with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service utilized electroshocking methods. An electrical current was introduced into the water column which resulted in stunning or disorienting the fish. During the time when the fish were disoriented they were netted by boat personnel. Selected whole fish and fillet samples were analyzed in a laboratory for PCBs.
