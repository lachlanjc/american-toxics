### Background

The 255-acre Pine Bend Sanitary Landfill (PBSL) site is located in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. PBSL, the largest open landfill in Minnesota, is an operating mixed-municipal solid waste facility. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1998.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included capping, extension of the public water supply to affected residences and a new solid waste permit that addresses groundwater contamination. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. EPA took the site off the NPL in 1998.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The primary concern is the VOC contamination in groundwater from leachate migrating from the site.

### Sampling and Monitoring

### Enforcement Information

In an April 1985 Response Order by Consent signed by the state and PBSL, the PRPs were required to investigate the nature and extent of contamination at the site.
