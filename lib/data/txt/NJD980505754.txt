### Background

The Sayreville Landfill site is located in Sayreville, Middlesex County, New Jersey. From 1971 to August 1977, the Borough of Sayreville operated the 35-acre area as a licensed municipal landfill that accepted municipal solid wastes and some light industrial wastes. Hazardous wastes disposed of at the site during and after closure contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Part of the site is located within the tidal wetlands of the adjacent South River. After initial actions to protect human health and the environment, the site’s long-term remedy was put in place. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1983. Once the risks were under control, EPA took the site off the NPL in September 2011. This site is being addressed through a combination of Federal, State, and potentially responsible parties' actions.

The Borough of Sayreville owned and operated a municipal landfill on-site beginning in 1970. It was licensed to receive municipal waste and light industrial waste. However, hazardous waste was allegedly disposed of during operations and after closure in 1977. After initial actions to protect human health and the environment, and site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983.  
Phenol, heavy metals including iron and manganese, volatile organic compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were detected on-site in shallow monitoring wells. On-site surface water was found to be contaminated with cadmium and lead and on-site sediments contained toluene and trichloroethylene. Benzene, arsenic, and chloroform were detected in on-site soils.

Initial actions were completed to restrict access to the site and to remove drums from the landfill. In accordance with the remedy selected in the 1990 Record of Decision (ROD), the remedial action completed in 1999 included the removal of additional drums, fencing of the site, capping of the landfill, and the installation of a storm water control and a methane collection system. The final ROD was signed in September 1998 included no further action for surface water and sediments, and a five-year ground-water monitoring program to observe changes, if any, in groundwater contamination levels. A five- year semi-annual ground-water monitoring program was initiated in 1999 for the purpose of obtaining ten sets of ground water monitoring data.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Initial Actions: The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), in coordination with the New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice, excavated 30 drums at the site in 1982.

Long-term Cleanup: EPA and NJDEP selected a remedy for the site in 1990. It included the removal of remaining hazardous waste drums, fencing the site, capping the landfill and installing a stormwater control system and methane gas collection system. Construction of the remedy began in July 1998 and finished in September 1999.

Groundwater, Surface Water and Sediments: Additional investigations of groundwater and off-site surface water and sediments have been completed. Based on these studies, EPA and NJDEP do not believe that further cleanup work will be necessary. The final ROD was signed in September 1998 which included no further action for surface water and sediments, and a five-year ground-water monitoring program to observe changes, if any, in groundwater contamination levels. The ROD also called for a Deed Notice to prevent any intrusive activities into the landfill cap and a Classification Exception Area (CEA) for the shallow aquifer near the site.

After the original five-year semi-annual monitoring program, the PRPs requested, and received, NJDEP approval to continue monitoring the site on an annual basis. The first annual report was submitted in 2006 and the latest annual monitoring took place in 2010. As in the previous reports, despite occasional fluctuations observed in the concentrations of some contaminants, the overall tendency is a slow, continuing decrease in the overall groundwater contaminant concentrations.

In 2011, NJDEP approved the revised Operation and Maintenance Plan with the following modifications to the sampling and analysis plan: 1) a reduction in the groundwater monitoring frequency to one round per five years; 2) monitoring of the deep water bearing zone is discontinued; 3) semi-volatile organic compounds were removed from the list of target analytes; 4) analysis only of benzene, chlorobenzene and chloroethane; 5) the list of target inorganic analytes was reduced to arsenic, chromium, lead, nickel and thallium; and 6) the low-flow purging and sampling methodology should continue to be used. The last groundwater monitoring was conducted in 2020 and the last landfill gas monitoring was completed in 2019.

NJDEP established a CEA in June 2007. The Borough of Sayreville signed a Deed Notice on July 26, 2010, and Middlesex County recorded it on August 10, 2010.

The site is currently being assessed for redevelopment potentials.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Based on the results of the first five-year review completed in 2002, the landfill cap and fencing continued to protect the public and the environment from potential risks. A second five-year review was completed in 2007, and included an evaluation of the monitoring data obtained over the last five years. As before, the landfill cap and fencing continues to be protective of human health and the environment. A thirdfive-year review completed in 2012 confirmed that the landfill cap continues to protect human health and the environment and groundwater contamination has decreased. A fourth- five year review was completed in 2017 and it confirmed that the landfill cap continues to protect human health and the environment and groundwater contamination has decreased.. The fifth five-year review for Sayreville Landfill was completed in 2021 and it confirmed that the landfill cap continues to protect human health and the environment and groundwater contamination has generally decreased.

In 2011, EPA determined that all appropriate Superfund-financed responses have been implemented, other than operation, maintenance and five-year reviews, and no further action by responsible parties is necessary. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 2011.
