### Background

The Kerr-McGee Chemical Corp – Navassa Superfund site is located in Navassa, North Carolina. Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation operated a wood-treating plant from 1936 to 1980. Wood treating operations generated wastewater that was disposed in ponds on site and wastewater discharged into the marsh on the south end of the facility. In 1980, Kerr-McGee removed equipment, buildings and storage tanks from the site and emptied on-site wastewater ponds.

Most of the contamination is located on the southwestern portion of the former facility, in the former process area and in the wetlands south of the former process area. The adjacent property, to the north, is a former fertilizer plant and boat factory. Residential properties are across North Navassa Road to the west. Sturgeon Creek borders the site to the south. Brunswick River borders the site to the east.

The upland area of the facility is about 150 acres, owned and managed by The Greenfield Environmental Multistate Trust LLC (MST), and about 90-acres of marsh became property of the State of North Carolina in the 1990s.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 2010 because of contaminated groundwater, soil and sediment caused by facility operations.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. A water line connects residences and businesses to the public water system. The site is physically stable with vegetation in place to prevent erosion.

By investigating and cleaning up the site, the EPA, the [North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ)](https://deq.nc.gov/) and MST continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NC DEQ) are working with the Multistate Trust to investigate the Site and plan the cleanup. EPA is the lead agency on the investigation and cleanup, with the NC DEQ as the supporting agency. The cleanup and management of the property is conducted by the Multistate Trust.

**2003**  
The state referred the site to EPA in 2003 and EPA entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Orders on Consent with Kerr-McGee in 2004.

**2006**  
Kerr-McGee created Tronox as a spin-off corporation in March 2006. In June 2006, EPA and Tronox entered into an Agreement to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study at the site under the Superfund Alternative Approach. EPA and Tronox completed the initial phases of a remedial investigation.

**2009**  
Tronox filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2009.

**2010**  
EPA listed the site on the NPL in April 2010.

**2011**  
The Tronox bankruptcy resulted in the creation of the Multistate Environmental Response Trust. Since 2011, the Multistate Environmental Response Trust has been conducting the remedial investigation and feasibility study activities.

**2017**  
Site investigations undertaken up to March 2017 are summarized in the Remedial Investigation Report.

**2018**  
The RI sampling was followed by a trenching study. The Multistate Trust dug 2,100 linear feet to form ten 4-foot deep trenches, targeting areas of interest based on historical photos and surface debris. This effort identified areas of previously unknown subsurface debris and visible soil contamination. The trench study provided information that challenged the assumptions about the wood storage areas. After the trench study, the EPA divided the facility into smaller exposure units based on anticipated future land use consistent with conceptual redevelopment plans developed with the community’s involvement.

**2019**  
In June 2019, to supplement both the ecological and human health risk assessments, the Multistate Trust collected 105 additional soil samples over 32 acres. The Multistate Trust prepared an addendum to the Site-wide HHRA in the August 2019 Human Health Risk Assessment Addendum (HHRA Addendum) which incorporates all the data collected for the OU1 area.

**2020**  
In 2020, the Multistate Trust collected additional samples to evaluate residential risk. The results were summarized in the OU1 Soil Sampling Technical Memorandum – Residential Criteria Area Delineation, which was approved by the EPA and the State in October 2020.

**2021**  
The EPA issued a Proposed Plan for OU1 in January 2021. The Record of Decision (ROD) for OU1 was signed on April 1, 2021. The EPA proposed the partial deletion of OU1 from the NPL on May 14, 2021 and the partial deletion was final on September 14, 2021. The investigation of the remainder of the Site (OUs 2, 3, 4, and 5) continued in 2021.

**2022**  
The EPA approved the Feasibility Study for OU2 in April 2022. OU2 is about 15.6 acres of the former wood storage areas shown in the map below. The [Feasibility Study report](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11167836.pdf) is available for download.

The EPA approved the [Proposed Plan](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11139277.pdf) for OU2 on May 26, 2022. EPA held a 30-day public comment period from June 1 to June 30, 2022, to seek public input on the Proposed Plan.

EPA signed the [Record of Decision for OU2](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11174386.pdf) on September 28, 2022.

**2024**  
The Multistate Trust began Remedial Action for OU2 in Spring 2024.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA and North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NC DEQ) are working with the Multistate Trust to investigate the Site and plan the cleanup. The site is physically stable and vegetation protects against erosion.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The most contaminated areas, the former wastewater ponds and process area, are fenced off to restrict access.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The Tronox bankruptcy resulted in the creation of the Multistate Environmental Response Trust. Since 2011, the Multistate Environmental Response trust has been conducting the remedial investigation and feasibility study activities, with oversight from EPA and NC DEQ.
