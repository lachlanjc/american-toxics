### Background

The Nyanza Chemical Waste Dump Superfund Site (“the Site”) is located in Ashland, Massachusetts. The Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is the lead agency, and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) is the support agency. The Site was added to USEPA's National Priorities List (NPL) on December 30, 1982. The Site is located on Megunko Road adjacent to railroad tracks used daily by freight and commuter trains. A former (now capped) landfill on Megunko Hill is located immediately southwest of the former industrial area. The Site is bounded to the north by industrial and commercial properties and the Sudbury River. From 1917 to 1978, several companies occupied the Site and manufactured textile dyes and dye intermediates, inorganic colloidal solids, and acrylic polymers. Nyanza, Inc. was the most recent dye manufacturing company to operate at the Site, from 1965 until 1978. Several types of chemical wastes were disposed of in various locations on the Site property with most of these wastes deposited on Megunko Hill, which was used as an unsecured landfill. Waste disposal included partially treated process wastewater; chemical sludge from the wastewater treatment process; solid process wastes (e.g., chemical precipitate and filter cakes) in drums; solvent recovery distillation residue in drums; and off-specification products. Process chemicals that could not be recycled or reused (including phenol, nitrobenzene, and mercuric sulfate) were also disposed on the Site property. Adjacent wetlands and drainageways to the Sudbury River received effluent discharge from Nyanza manufacturing operations. The Western wetland, at the headwaters of Chemical Brook, contained wastewater treatment sludge and likely received overflow from an underground concrete wastewater vault. The vault, which was taken out of service in the 1960s or 1970s and removed in 1988, continued to be an ongoing source of contamination from the Site via discharges to Chemical Brook, Trolley Brook, through the Chemical Brook Culvert to Outfall Creek, and into the Lower Raceway to the Sudbury River. Site topography includes the highest bedrock surface on Megunko Hill which decreases radially to a valley parallel to and south of the east end of Pleasant Street. The upper portions of bedrock, particularly the upper two to eight feet, are weathered and highly fractured. Groundwater flows from the former Nyanza, Inc. property and capped landfill in a north/northeast direction. In the center of the plume near the railroad tracks, groundwater flows in a more easterly direction parallel to the Sudbury River; this flow pattern is presumably influenced by a bedrock trough which represents a pre-glacial riverbed. The current owner of the former Nyanza, Inc. property leases land to various commercial businesses. Several removal, response, and remedial actions have been performed at the Site between 1987 and 2013.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed in stages, including initial actions and long-term remedial phases focused on source control and cleanup of the soil, off-site groundwater, wetlands and the Sudbury River. Several removal, response, and remedial actions have been performed at the Site between 1987 and 2013. The Site is divided into the following four Operable Units (OUs) for purposes of investigations and remedial actions:

Operable Unit 01 (OU1) includes the 35-acre former Nyanza, Inc. property, consisting of the (now capped) Megunko Hill landfill and several adjacent upland and wetland areas where soils and sludges were contaminated with heavy metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), which were excavated during removal actions from 1987 and 1990, and remedial actions from 1990 and 1992.

Operable Unit 02 (OU2) includes the groundwater contamination, whcih consists of a groundwater plume with dissolved VOC contaminants flowing from the former Nyanza, Inc. property (the contamination source area) in a north/northeasterly direction toward the Sudbury River. EPA selected an interim remedy to clean up off-site groundwater contamination in 1991. The selected remedy was to pump and treat the contaminated groundwater from the most contaminated portions of the plume for five years. However, due to the discovery of additional contamination, EPA reevaluated the remedy. After additional data collection and risk assessment, with added emphasis on potential vapor intrusion risk, EPA updated the remedy in 2006. This included the extraction of dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) from the subsurface, the installation of vapor mitigation systems (VMS) in buldings overlying the contaminated plume, and additional groundwater monitoring. Forty VMS were installed in 2007, which are inspected by Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) annually. In 2013, EPA ainstalled two extraction well systems to recover residual DNAPL, which is contributing to dissolved VOC contaminants in the groundwater plume. In January 2020, EPA presented a Proposed Plan for Operable Unit 02 to the public for review, held a public hearing and meeting, and a public comment period through March 20, 2020. EPA documented the final selected groundwater remedy for Operable Unit 2 in a Record of Decision (ROD) dated July 2020.

Operable Unit 03 (OU3) includes remediated wetlands and drainageways located between the former Nyanza Inc. property and the Sudbury River, which acted as continuing sources of mercury contamination to the river. These areas included the Eastern Wetland, Trolley Brook, Chemical Brook, and Outfall Creek/Lower Raceway which discharges to the Sudbury River. Remedial actions occurred between 1999 and 2001, and included the excavation of over 45,000 cubic yards of mercury-contaminated sediment which was placed within the existing on-Site capped landfill.

Operable Unit 04 (OU4) includes a 26-mile stretch of the Sudbury River in six communities from Ashland to its confluence with the Assabet River in Concord, MA, where Site-related mercury contamination impacts sediment and fish tissue. Remedial actions for OU4 were conducted between 1992 and 2017 and included the posting of fish consumption/mercury advisory signs at fishing area, extensive sediment sampling, fish tissue collection for mercury analyses, and evaluation of a possible sand capping plan in one stretchg of the river. Due to a decreasing trend in mercury concentrations in fish tissue, in addition to public opposition, EPA did not implement the sand capping remedy. MassDEP assists EPA with the long-term monitoring of fish tissue to study mercury concentrations over time, and inspects the posted fish advisory signs annually making repairs and relocating signage as necessary.

Additional information on Site history and remedial actions implemented to date is available in the latest USEPA Five Year Review dated May 2024.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is in the process of implementing the selected groundwater remedy for OU2, which includes additional DNAPL investigations, replacing and upgrading an existing DNAPL extraction system, conducting expanded groundwater monitoring, and in-situ treatment of groundwater in/near the contaminant source area to lower concentrations of VOCs in the groundwater and further mitigate the vapor intrusion risk.

MassDEP conducts operation and maintenance (O&M) activities on behalf of EPA for remedies that were previously implemented at the Site. The O&M activities includes inspections of the capped landfill and surrounding areas and remediated wetlands, sample collection from groundwater wells located around the capped landfill, maintenance of Chemical Brook, and annual inspections of the VMS.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**

This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.

The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site.
