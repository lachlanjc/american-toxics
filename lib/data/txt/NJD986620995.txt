### Background

The Welsbach & General Gas Mantle Superfund site is located in the cities of Camden and Gloucester City, New Jersey. The site includes two former incandescent gas mantle manufacturing facilities, as well as nearly 1,000 residential, commercial, industrial and recreational properties. The Welsbach Company (Welsbach) manufactured gas mantles at its facility in Gloucester City from the 1890s through the 1940s, while the General Gas Mantle Facility (GGM) operated in Camden from 1912 to 1941. In order to make the gas mantles glow brighter, Welsbach and GGM used monazite ore and processed it to extract thorium (Th), a radionuclide that emits radiation during radioactive decay and glows bright when heated. The remaining material from the processed ore, which still contained radioactive elements, are now believed to have been used as fill throughout areas of Gloucester City and Camden. The fill was also used in constructing residential and commercial buildings and in low-lying areas in and around the Welsbach facility. After site investigations, immediate actions were taken to protect human health and the environment. The site’s long-term cleanup is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Immediate Actions: In the early 1990s, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) investigated more than 1,100 properties in Camden and Gloucester City for radiological contamination. As a protective measure, NJDEP installed gamma radiation shielding at about 30 properties and radon ventilation systems on three properties. NJDEP also purchased one contaminated residential property and relocated one commercial business. In December 1998, EPA excavated about 260 tons of radiologically contaminated soil from a public park area in Gloucester City and replaced it with clean fill. In September 2001, EPA did another removal action in Gloucester City. EPA removed about 210 tons of radiologically contaminated soils from three residential properties and installed a radon mitigation system on another property.

OU1 – Soils and Waste Materials –Based on NJDEP's investigations, about 100 properties were identified as potentially contaminated with radiological materials. In July 1999, EPA selected a cleanup plan for these areas in the site’s July 1999 ROD. It included excavation and off-site disposal of radiologically contaminated soil and waste materials, as well as demolition of the General Gas Mantle (GGM) building. The July 1999 ROD was amended in January 2025 to modify the excavation depth of radiologically contaminated soil at the Former Welsbach Facility (FWF) and other waste material in certain areas of the FWF. Some areas of contamination located under current structures will be remediated when the property owner/operator makes those areas accessible. In July 2024, an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) was issued to acquire additional properties in Gloucester City and permanently relocate its residents and demolish corresponding structures instead of the 1999 plan which called for temporary relocation. This change comes because of compromised structural integrity of the buildings, risk to the occupants and the cost of cleaning up the contamination in or below the structures.

OU2 – Armstrong Building – After a remedial investigation and feasibility study for the Armstrong Building, EPA selected a cleanup plan in the site’s September 2011 ROD. It included decontamination of radiologically contaminated surfaces in the building, along with off-site disposal of the waste materials. This remedy was implemented and completed in 2016.

OU3 – Surface Water, Sediments, and Wetlands – After ecological investigations of the South Branch of Newton Creek, Martin’s Lake and parts of the Delaware River next to the site, EPA determined in the site’s July 2005 ROD that no remedial action was necessary.

To address long-term site risks, EPA has investigated close to 1,521 properties in Camden and Gloucester City and has completed the cleanup on 184 of the 211 properties identified as contaminated. To date, EPA has excavated and disposed of more than 400,000 tons of radiologically contaminated soils and waste materials. These cleanups included removing about 105,000 tons of contaminated soil from Gloucester City Swim Club and adjacent residential properties; about 23,000 tons from the site of a Gloucester City middle school; 35,000 tons from residential properties along Highland Avenue and Klemm Boulevard in Gloucester City; more than 55,000 tons from the General Gas Mantle area in Camden, more than 16,000 tons from residential properties and wetlands areas along Temple Avenue in Gloucester City, and about 130,000 tons from the recreational properties along Johnson Boulevard in Gloucester City.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in two stages: immediate actions and a long-term cleanup phase focused on the entire site. To address the long-term cleanup phase, EPA divided the site into four areas, or operable units (OUs) – soils and waste materials, the Armstrong Building, surface water and sediments, and groundwater.

The status is as follows:

OU1 – Soils and Waste Materials – A remedial investigation and feasibility study was completed for the Site in January 1999. To expedite the development of the Record of Decision (ROD - which documents EPA’s selected cleanup plan) and begin cleanup of the Site, EPA investigated a subset of the potentially contaminated properties including the FWF. EPA issued the OU1 ROD or cleanup plan in July 1999. The selected cleanup plan included soil excavation and removal, off-site disposal of radiological contamination, decontamination and demolition of contaminated structures including the former General Gas Mantle facility, and environmental monitoring to evaluate the effectiveness of the remedy. After further soil investigation and data collection, a change in the original July 1999 ROD was issued in January 2025. This change in remedy, known as a ROD Amendment, is more practical to implement and more cost-effective while maintaining the same level of public protection as the original 1999 remedy.

OU2 – Armstrong Building – In 2011, EPA issued the cleanup plan for OU2. The selected remedy included decontamination of radiologically contaminated building surfaces and off-site disposal of radiologically contaminated waste materials. Except for soil and materials beneath the building slab, remediation of the Armstrong Building has been completed.

OU3 – Surface Water, Sediments, and Wetlands – In 2002, EPA began investigations for OU3, conducting ecological investigations and developing human health and ecological risk assessments for the South Branch of Newton Creek, Martin’s Lake, and the Delaware River. In July 2005, EPA issued a cleanup plan for OU3, which indicated that no cleanup action was necessary for surface water, sediments, and wetlands at the Site.

OU4 – Groundwater - A remedial investigation for OU4 identified a radium (Ra) groundwater plume, mainly consisting of Ra-228 at the FWF. In September 2021, EPA issued an interim cleanup plan for OU4 that includes groundwater monitoring and institutional controls. Design investigations have been completed to support implementation of the interim remedy for OU4.
