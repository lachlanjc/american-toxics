### Background

The Jackson Park Housing Complex (USNAVY) site is located in eastern Kitsap County, about two miles northwest of Bremerton, Washington. Also known as the Jackson Park Housing Complex/Naval Hospital Bremerton (JPHC/NHB), the site occupies about 206 acres along Ostrich Bay. From 1904 to 1959, the facility operated as a Navy ammunition depot and included ordnance, manufacturing, processing and disassembly. Residual ordnance powders were disposed of by open burning. Hazardous dust deposited on floors during ordnance handling was washed into floor drains that lead into Ostrich Bay. The site also included incinerators, paint, battery and machine shops, and a boiler plant. Site activities contaminated surface water, soil and sludge with hazardous chemicals and heavy metals. EPA has divided the site into several cleanup areas, or operable units (OUs), to better address site cleanup. Remedy construction has been completed for some areas. Investigations and remedy construction are underway at the remaining OUs.

The Jackson Park Housing Complex (JPHC) is located east of Highway 3, approximately two miles northwest of Bremerton, Washington. The 300-acre complex currently contains housing for 3,000 military personnel. From 1904 to 1959, the facility operated as a Navy ammunition depot and included ordnance, manufacturing, processing, and disassembly. Residual ordnance powders were disposed of by open burning. Hazardous dust that was deposited on floors during ordnance handling was washed into floor drains that lead into Ostrich Bay. In addition to ammunition-related activities, the site also contained incinerators, paint, battery and machine shops, and a boiler plant. The munitions buildings were demolished between 1973 and 1975, when the housing complexes were built.

The munitions buildings were demolished between 1973 and 1975, when the housing complexes were built. According to reports from several sources, the water in Ostrich Bay occasionally became a yellow color due to discharges emanating from the ordnance facility. The yellow color was a result of wastewater containing ammonium picrate (an explosive) or dyes. During decontamination and demolition operations in 1974 and 1975, ammonium picrate was found in storm drains leaving abandoned buildings that had formerly housed ordnance operations.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that the remedies implemented for OU-1 at JPHC/NHB are protective both in the short and long term, with the exception of the Benzene Release Area and human consumption of marine tissue. The remedy in the Benzene Release Area is not protective, because benzene concentrations in seep water discharging to Ostrich Bay continue to exceed the cleanup goal.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long term remedy included installation of a soil and vegetation cover over contaminated soil; shoreline stabilization; institutional controls; implementation of a shellfish sampling program; and signs along the shoreline to notify local residents of any harvest restrictions. Site cleanup also included the removal and off-site disposal of wooden pilings from abandoned Navy structures; excavation and disposal of contaminated soil; establishment of an environmental monitoring program; and subsurface placement of oxygen-releasing chemicals. Remedy construction began in 2000 and is ongoing.  

Investigation, pilot testing and removal actions are underway at the Benzene Release Area, with progress toward determining a revised remedy. The revised remedy is expected to be protective once selected and implemented. The protectiveness of the remedy with regard to human consumption of marine tissue cannot be determined at this time, because analysis of marine tissue for ordnance compounds has not yet been performed using the recently developed analytical methodologies. Until such analysis can be completed, human exposure to marine tissue is being prevented through institutional controls that prohibit harvesting of shellfish from Ostrich Bay. The remedies for OU-2 and OU-3 will be selected based on their protectiveness of human health and the environment. The remedies are therefore expected to be protective, once selected and implemented.
