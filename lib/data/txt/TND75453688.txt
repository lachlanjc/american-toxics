### Background

The 8.6-acre Mallory Capacitor Company [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) Site is located on Belew Circle in Waynesboro, Tennessee. The Site includes one warehouse structure. The Green River borders the Site to the east. Residences and industrial and commercial businesses border the Site to the north, south and west. The Site’s broader surroundings include mixed residential, commercial and industrial land uses.

City Chemical Company began operating a footwear manufacturing facility at the site in the late 1940s. P.R. Mallory acquired the facility in the late 1960s and conducted electrical capacitor manufacturing operations until 1984. Operations at the Mallory electrical capacitor manufacturing facility contaminated soils and groundwater.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1989 because of contaminated groundwater resulting from facility operations. The EPA, the [Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC)](https://www.tn.gov/environment/about‐tdec‐home.html), and the site’s [potentially responsible party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) have investigated site conditions. By treating and monitoring groundwater, placing institutional controls on the site property and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, the EPA, TDEC and the Site’s PRP continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

In 2022, the PRP initiated an investigation into the potential for vapor intrusion due to contaminated groundwater at the Site. Twelve soil gas boring locations were sampled in November 2022. Since then, numerous sampling events have been conducted expanding the soil gas investigation and including indoor air, and sewer line sampling. As of January 2025, two residential homes have vapor mitigation systems installed, additional mitigation is proposed for a sewer line that runs adjacent to Belew Circle, and soil gas borings are being sampled for seasonal variations. The vapor intrusion investigation is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Site’s PRP led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by the EPA and TDEC.

| When | What |
| --- | --- |
| **1988 - 1989** | The Site’s PRP dug up and disposed of contaminated soil and debris off site. The PRP alos installed monitoring wells on and off site. |
| **1991** | The EPA issued the Site’s long-term cleanup plan which included:  - installing five groundwater extraction wells; - using a pump-and-treat system on site to address contaminated groundwater; - testing to determine the spread of groundwater contamination and possible effects on a nearby creek; - placing institutional controls on the site property; and - implementing a monitoring program to assess the effectiveness of Site cleanup activities. |
| **1993** | On-Site physical cleanup was completed. The PRP began groundwater extraction and treatment activities. |
| **2001** | The PRP installed six additional monitoring wells to determine the spread of groundwater contamination and monitor its cleanup. |
| **May 2014** | In cooperation with the EPA, the City of Waynesboro Commission adopted the Waynesboro Groundwater Ordinance limiting groundwater withdrawal in designated areas around the Site. |
| **Septmeber 2018** | The [fifth Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11111845.pdf) was completed. The report did not identify any issues or recommendations other than the continued operation of the groundwater extraction and treatment system. However, the report did provide that the PRP should follow-up with the planned vapor intrusion investigation in the “Other Findings” section of the report. |
| **November 2022** | The PRP begin work on the vapor intrusion investigation. |
| **Septmeber 2023** | The [sixth Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11189824.pdf) was completed. The report concluded that protectiveness determination was deferred until the vapor intrusion investigation is completed and permanent mitigation is in place. |

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11189824.pdf) was published by the EPA HQs in 2023. The remedy at the Site currently protects human health and the environment in the short-term.

On-Site physical cleanup was completed in 1993. Groundwater treatment and monitoring are ongoing. The vapor Intrusion investigation and mitigation are ongoing.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Cleanup efforts include regulating land use and monitoring groundwater.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, the EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

In 1990, the EPA entered into a Consent Order with the potentially responsible parties (PRPs), requiring them to undertake a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study for the site. A Unilateral Administrative Order for Remedial Action was issued by the EPA in February 1995 directing the PRPs to implement the cleanup activities described in the ROD.
