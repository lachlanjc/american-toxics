### Background

The Midwest Manufacturing/North Farm site consists of two separate pieces of property known as the North Farm Operable Unit (OU1) and the Midwest Manufacturing Operable Unit (OU2).

Operable Unit 1: OU1 is located in a rural area on a dead-end gravel road and is less than one acre in size. OU1 consists of a trench that was used for disposal of sludges generated at OU2 during 1977 and 1978. The original Record of Decision (ROD) for OU1 was signed on September 30, 1988. Before the 1988 ROD was implemented, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reevaluated the site risks and amended the ROD in 1993. The amended remedy for OU1 was a limited action remedy, which included deed restrictions that would prevent use of the disposal area as a vegetable garden and prevent the installation of a water supply well, and included limited groundwater monitoring to verify that the remedy remains protective of human health and the environment. Monitoring ended in 1998. Deed restrictions that were put in place in 1994 have a 21-year lifetime per Iowa Code, and while still on file in the county office, may no longer be enforceable. The EPA is working to place an environmental covenant with the current owners and thereby establish enforceable land use restrictions for OU1.

Operable Unit 2: OU2 is located at 101 High Street in the city of Kellogg, in Jasper County, Iowa. It consisted of former Midwest Manufacturing Company, which manufactured small engine parts. The property is bounded by the North Skunk River to the south, and encompasses approximately eight acres. In 1982, soil sampling was conducted at OU1 by the EPA which resulted in the need for additional investigations. Remedial Investigation (RI) field activities at OU1 were conducted in 1989 and 1990. A ROD was signed for OU2 on September 27, 1990. The selected remedy provided for groundwater treatment, capping of the waste disposal trench in accordance with Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) landfill closure and post-closure requirements and groundwater monitoring. Before the 1990 ROD was implemented, the EPA reevaluated the site risks and amended the OU2 ROD in 1993. The amended remedy selected no action for soils and limited action for groundwater. Specifically, the amended remedy required deed restrictions to prevent the installation of a water supply well; a survey of all water supply wells, both public and private within one mile of the plant property; the installation of two additional monitoring wells close to existing public water supply wells; and groundwater monitoring to verify that the remedy remains protective of human health and the environment. A perimeter fence was installed to prevent disturbance of the disposal areas trench. Semi-annual ground water monitoring will continue at the OU2.

The Fifth Five-Year Review Report for Midwest Manufacturing/North Farm (dated 03/17/2021) identified six Issues and Recommendations. Issues are related to addressing additional monitoring needs, a change in site conditions (identification of benzene), and a review of the Remedy Performance. To address these issues, the EPA is developing a contract for a limited site investigation. The limited site investigation is tentatively planned for summer 2024. Groundwater and vapor intrusion sampling continues at OU2 (the former Midwest Manufacturing facility) on a semi-annual basis.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The remedy at OU1 uses institutional controls to protect human health and the environment. The institutional controls are implemented as deed restrictions currently prohibiting use of groundwater or use of the disposal area as a vegetable garden.

The remedy at OU2 currently protects human health and the environment because the existing Environmental Covenant prohibits changes in land use of the property and installation of water supply wells. Groundwater sampling and monitoring is performed semi-anually and vapor intrusion sampling is performed annually at the site to ensure protectivenss.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

For the OU1 to be protective in the long term, an environmental covenant that also restricts residential use of the property and ensures these restrictions are enforceable, has been put in place.

For the OU2 to be protective in the long term, the environmental covenant needed to be modified to require advance agency notification of any excavation below the water table or planned land use changes, such as building modifications or new building construction, that may result in potentially unacceptable human health risks from the subsurface vapor intrusion pathway, so that appropriate additional investigations and actions can be taken. Additionally, the covenant required modification to extend protections to the full groundwater and vapor monitoring network in current use. To incorporate these requirements, the covenant was modified. The modified environmental covenant with the above modifications has been put in place.
