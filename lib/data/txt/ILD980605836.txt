### Background

The H.O.D. Landfill Site is a 51 acre landfill within a 121 acre area in Antioch, Illinois. The area is adjacent to a freshwater wetland and Sequoit Creek, a stream that flows into a series of nearby lakes. The landfill portion is divided into the "old landfill" and the "new landfill." Operations began at the "old landfill" in 1963 and at the "new landfill" in 1975. Following the landfill’s closure in 1984, it was covered with clay. Vinyl chloride-contaminated groundwater is the main risk at the site. The site’s long-term remedy is in place. Operation and maintenance activities and groundwater monitoring are ongoing.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The site’s most recent five-year review was completed in September 2015.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Cleanup at the site was completed in 2001. EPA’s remedy included cap improvements, enhanced gas and leachate collection systems, leachate treatment, and monitored natural attenuation of groundwater. EPA also implemented institutional controls, including deed restrictions, to regulate the use of the property and groundwater.

EPA is conducting a five-year review of the H.O.D. Landfill Superfund site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.
