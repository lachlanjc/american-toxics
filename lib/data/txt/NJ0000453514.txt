### Background

The Route 561 Dump Site is located in Gibbsboro, Camden County, New Jersey. From the mid-1800s until 1977, John Lucas & Company, and subsequently, the Sherwin-Williams Company, operated a paint and varnish manufacturing facility at a nearby location in Gibbsboro. Industrial waste from the manufacturing facility was discarded in the Route 561 Dump Site. As a result, the soil and sediment at the Dump Site were contaminated primarily with lead and arsenic.

The Route 561 Dump Site is located approximately 700 feet to the southeast of the former Sherwin-Williams manufacturing plant. After dumping activities ceased, portions of the Route 561 Dump Site were developed. The Site now includes commercial and retail businesses, a portion of a residential area, wooded undeveloped lots and a portion of White Sand Branch.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In November 1997, EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent to conduct an immediate action called a Removal Action. Under the Removal Action, highly contaminated soil in a wooded area near the base of Clement Lake was fenced and was consolidated into three areas that were capped and were revegetated.

EPA issued a Decision Document in September 2016 documenting its decision to address soil and sediment contamination at the Dump Site by excavation, off-site disposal, and capping. In the summer of 2021, soil and sediment cleanup at the Dump Site and surrounding properties was completed. Approximately 65,482 tons of contaminated soil and sediment containing elevated levels of arsenic and lead were removed and sent to permitted disposal facilities. Some areas containing residual levels of lead and arsenic remaining at depth were capped.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Removal of contaminated soil and sediment at the Site was completed in September 2021. Restoration and re-establishment of native vegetation along the stream banks of White Sand Branch was also completed in September 2021. Currently, groundwater is being evaluated to determine to what extent the soil cleanup may have improved groundwater quality.
