### Background

The 11-acre Chemfax [Superfund site](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) is located in Gulfport, Harrison County, Mississippi. The site is bordered to the east by Three Rivers Road and by Creosote Road to the south. Located to the north is County Barn Road and Bernard Bayou, and to the west are a rail line and the abandoned Alpine Masonite facility.

The site began operations in 1955, producing synthetic hydrocarbon resins and waxes from petroleum products. The primary operation at the time business ceased in 1995 was a paraffin blending process in which different grades of paraffin wax were heated together to a liquid state, blended, and then cooled with water. Cooling water was obtained from an on-site industrial well and stored in an on-site holding pond and reused. Site soils and groundwater beneath the site have been impacted by these operations.

The site was proposed to Superfund's [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1993 and finalized on the NPL in March 2012.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the lead and the State of Mississippi, as represented by the [Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ)](https://www.mdeq.ms.gov/), has been the support agency during the remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) process for the site. The site is located on "Sixteenth Section" land, which by State law is held in trust by the State to be used for the benefit of Mississippi's public education system. As the owner of the land, the State of Mississippi is the sole remaining responsible party.

**1999**  
In December 1998, an EPA site visit revealed that the site was easily accessible, many drums were stored on site, and site buildings were being lived in by transients. These conditions were addressed by EPA through Superfund's removal authority, which addresses immediate and/or short-term threats to human health and the environment. Response actions included improvement of site security to limit access; removal and off-site disposal of asbestos present on remaining equipment; removal of drums; disposal of contents remaining in on-site storage tanks; disposal of 2,000 cubic yards of excavated soils; and dismantling of most of the processing lines, tank farms, bulk storage areas, buildings and structures.

**2002**  
The long-term remedy, or [Record of Decision (ROD)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/92627), was selected in 2002.

**2013**  
The EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order (UAO) to compel the State of Mississippi to implement the amended remedy at the site. EPA also negotiated an agreement with the State of Mississippi that addressed the resolution of outstanding past costs for the site.

An [Amended ROD](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/10925451) was published in November 2013.

Site preparation work began as part of the cleanup actions called for by the 2013 amended remedy.

**2014**  
Soil excavation activities began in April 2014.

**2015**  
Due to the lack of available funding, site activities were discontinued from November 2014 until July 2015. Significantly higher volumes of contaminated soils above cleanup levels were found than that estimated in the 2013 AROD.

**2016**  
On January 12, 2016, a joint site inspection of the constructed remedy was held with personnel from EPA and the State of Mississippi.

The installation of additional groundwater wells was completed January 29, 2016. The well network will monitor levels of contaminants in the groundwater beneath the site.

Excavation activities were completed in December 2016 with a total of 109,211 tons of soils disposed off-site. All construction activities have been completed at the site.

**2017**  
In February 2017, a restrictive environmental covenant was placed on the site that will restrict groundwater use until contaminant levels in groundwater have been restored to safe levels.

In July 2017, the site achieved EPA's Site-Wide Ready for Anticipated Use (SWRAU) target.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

With completion of the construction work in 2016, site soils now support an unrestricted use. Groundwater use will be restricted and contaminant levels monitored until they have attenuated to acceptable levels. Until groundwater monitoring shows that contamination has attenuated to acceptable levels, EPA will conduct Five-Year Reviews to ensure the remedy remains protective of human health and environment. The first Five-Year Review for the site will be conducted in 2021.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
