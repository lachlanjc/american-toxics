The Jacobsville Neighborhood Soil Contamination site includes the Jacobsville neighborhood as well as 12 other neighborhoods in Evansville, Indiana. The site consists of residential soils contaminated by lead and arsenic, and it covers a 4.5-square-mile area.

The site was named the Jacobsville Neighborhood Soil Contamination site because the contamination was initially found in the Jacobsville neighborhood of Evansville. However, after further investigations, U.S. EPA found that contamination extended to other areas of Evansville. The affected area includes residential, commercial, and industrial properties; the Superfund cleanup will address residential properties only.

Part of the Jacobsville neighborhood was formerly occupied by several manufacturing and foundry companies that date back to the 1880s. These industrial activities—some operated from the 1880s through the 1950s—resulted in lead contamination in a wide area of soil. Some soil is also contaminated with arsenic.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2004. The first phase of the cleanup began in 2007. Subsequent cleanup phases began in 2008 and continue to this day. The combined cleanups from 2007 to date have resulted in soil sampling at 5,787 properties, and the removal of lead- and arsenic-contaminated soil from 3,746 residential properties in Evansville as of December 2021.

EPA is continuing cleanup work and is planning additional soils sampling and cleanup efforts for 2022 and beyond. EPA estimates that at least 5,000 residential properties will require cleanup.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

#### Bipartisan infrastructure Law Funding

This site is one of many across the country to receive funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which invested $3.5 billion in environmental remediation at Superfund sites on the National Priorities List. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding will be used to accelerate the number of properties cleaned up each year and shorten the timeframe to project completion. EPA plans on addressing over 170 properties in the 2023 field season, and will significantly ramp up work in the 2024 field season and beyond with the goal of remediating 400 properties each year. The work consists of excavating soil at each property contaminated with lead and arsenic above cleanup criteria, and restoring these yards with backfill and fresh sod or other material as appropriate. EPA intends to continue this work until all contaminated properties within the 4.5 square mile area have been addressed.

In 2022, EPA cleaned up contaminated soil at 250 properties, for a total of around 4,000 properties cleaned up since 2007 when work began. Additionally, EPA tested the soil at around 800 additional properties this year, bringing the total of properties sampled at the site to over 6,500. EPA anticipates the soil replacement project will last for several more years.

Soil excavations will resume in Spring 2023. EPA expects to cleanup 250 properties this year. EPA will also resume soil sampling in 2023. The goal is to sample up to 400 properties this year.

All work will be performed during regular business hours to minimize the inconvenience caused to neighbors. The contractors conducting cleanup activities take precautions to ensure no dust is generated while the work is done or during transportation of excavated soil.

#### Soil Sampling

The first step in EPA’s soil cleanup process is to get written permission from the property owner — via a consent form called an “access agreement”— so EPA can collect soil samples. The samples are taken by digging several narrow holes up to 18 inches deep at several spots in both the front yard and the back yard.

The samples are taken by digging several narrow holes up to 18 inches deep at several spots in both the front yard and the back yard. The samples are taken from these holes at 6-inch intervals of depth. Levels of lead and arsenic in the sample are measured in units called parts per million. Once EPA receives the test results from the lab, we will send a letter explaining what the results were, and what the next steps are. Test results are sent directly to property owners.

Test results for lead above 400 parts lead per million parts soil (parts per million, abbreviated ppm) are above EPA’s cleanup threshold. EPA’s cleanup standard for arsenic contamination is 30 ppm. Properties exceeding those levels will be placed on the cleanup list.
