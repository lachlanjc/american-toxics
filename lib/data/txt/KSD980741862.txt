### Background

The Cherokee County Superfund site is a former mining area in southeast Kansas, part of a larger regional mining area known as the Tri-State Mining District. It covers about 115 square miles. Over 100 years of widespread lead and zinc mining created piles of mine tailings covering more than 4,000 acres. The mine tailings contaminated groundwater with lead, zinc and cadmium. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

The site is divided into seven subsites that are grouped and divided into nine operable units (OUs). Lead and zinc mining was conducted for over 100 years from the middle 1800s to 1970 at the site and the primary contaminants of concern are lead, zinc and cadmium. Millions of cubic yards of mine tailings are present at the surface in addition to impacted soils, surface water, sediments and groundwater.

The site was listed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1983. Several Records of Decision (RODs) have been issued and many cleanups have been completed or are currently underway. Several Consent Decrees with responsible parties (PRPs) have also been completed and PRPs have funded and conducted many cleanups at the site in addition to cleanup actions funded and implemented by the EPA and the Kansas Department of Health and the Environment (KDHE). Bankruptcy settlements have also yielded monies for site use in addition to American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding.

Site-wide, nearly three million cubic yards of mining wastes have been remediated on over 2,800 acres, over 800 residential yards have been remediated and over 500 homes have been supplied with a clean, permanent source of drinking water.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The EPA and responsible parties have completed investigation and response work to address residential yards, private drinking water wells and non-residential mining and milling wastes, contaminated soils and stream sediments. Ongoing work is discussed in the section “ **What is the Current Site Status?**”

The EPA placed the site on the NPL on September 8, 1983. The EPA began its investigation of the Galena subsite in 1985. The Galena subsite investigations demonstrated that the shallow groundwater aquifer and the surface water were contaminated with elevated concentrations of metals.

Initial response actions included the provision of bottled water and water softener units as removal actions prior to the construction of a permanent alternate water supply system as the final remedial action. This initial removal action work was conducted in the Galena subsite. A subsequent removal action was conducted in Galena and involved the remediation of residential yards that were significantly impacted by elevated levels of lead.

The EPA designated nine operable units for cleanup activities due to the location of mine and milling wastes and the location of mining operations by various potentially responsible parties (PRPs) who are liable for cleanup actions. Several response actions have been completed at the site and many are currently underway. Thus, many OUs are in different phases of the Superfund process. Work activities have also been conducted by the responsible parties, in addition to EPA and KDHE, at many of the subsites and OUs. OU1, OU3, OU4, OU5, OU6 and OU7 have completed/ongoing response activities while OU2 and OU9 are in the site characterization phase.

The sixth Five-Year Review document included a more detailed description and review of the ongoing site remedies (OU1, OU3, OU4, OU5, OU6 and OU7). During a Five-Year Review, EPA reviews the. Several issues and recommendations were identified for OU3, OU4, OU5, OU6 and OU7. For more information, please review the sixth Five-Year Review document found at: [https://semspub.epa.gov/work/07/30470695.pdf](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/07/30470695.pdf) (52 pp, 2.36 MB,  [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ).

The status of these OUs are summarized in the table below:

| **Operable Unit (OU)** | **Status** |
| --- | --- |
| OU1 - Galena Alternate Water Supply | Complete |

### What Is the Current Site Status?

This site is one of many across the country to receive funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which invested $3.5 billion in environmental remediation at Superfund sites on the National Priorities List. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding will be used to conduct remedial actions to residential yards (e.g., excavation and off-site disposal of the site’s remaining contaminated soils; excavation backfilling and re-vegetation of previously excavated areas), non-residential mining and milling wastes, and contaminated soils.

The EPA is currently conducting response actions to residential yards, private drinking water wells and non-residential mining and milling wastes, contaminated soils and stream sediments. There is ongoing investigation work on the Spring River and Neosho River watersheds.

Activities have been completed at OU1 and OU5. The following information summarizes the current status of the remaining ongoing OU’s at the Site (OU2, OU3, OU4, OU6, OU7, OU8 and OU9). Activities have been completed at OU1 and OU5. The following information summarizes the current status of the remaining ongoing OUs at the site.

**OU2 - Spring River Basin:** This OU addresses contaminated surface water and sediments in streams of the Spring River Basin as a part of the Tri-State Mining District Watersheds that connect three states and two EPA Regions 6 and 7. For the purposes of site characterization, the Spring River Basin was split into Upper and Lower units. The Upper Spring River basin is the main channel of Spring River and its tributaries from Empire Lake and upstream into Missouri. The Lower Spring River basin is the main channel of Spring River and its tributaries from the dams at Empire Lake and downstream to Oklahoma. The EPA has completed a Remedial Investigation report for the Upper and Lower Spring River Basin which includes OU2. This report analyzed contamination from unconsolidated mine waste that has been released or is being released into the watersheds creeks, streams, and adjacent floodplain soils. Currently, the EPA is developing Non-Time Critical Removal Actions to support the ongoing Feasibility Study to evaluate cleanup technologies.

Technical documents for the ongoing investigations within the watersheds are available on the Site Documents & Data section of this site profile page, under Reports and Documents, link for OU2/OU9 Technical Documents.

**OU3 - Baxter Springs Subsite:** In 2019, the EPA completed an EPA-lead remedial action to address approximately 400,000 cubic yards of mine waste and contaminated soils. Remaining design was completed for remaining mine waste areas and distal sites. A remedial action is planned for award by September 2023.

**OU4 - Treece Subsite:** Currently, there is an ongoing phase of EPA-lead remedial action that remediated four work areas with mine waste, contaminated soils, and contaminated sediments of the northwest intermittent tributary to Tar Creek known as the former Webber Mine Complex. The remaining activity at these areas is revegetation. In August 2024 the EPA finalized an Explanation of Significant Differences to allow for the remaining contaminated sediment and mine waste in the main stem of Tar Creek to be remediated under OU4 in upcoming Remedial Action plans.

**OU6 - Badger, Lawton, Waco and Crestline subsites:** Repair work was required on previously completed EPA-lead remedial action project areas due to flooding and drought. The Kansas Department of Health and the Environment is conducting these repairs under a cooperative agreement with the EPA.

**OU7 - Galenda Residential Soils:** The Remedial Action, which finished in May 2001, predated by the Removal Action, addressed a total of 702 properties in Galena, Kansas. EPA is currently sampling residential soils in Galena for contaminants of concern, specifically lead and cadmium.

**OU8 - Railroads:** Following the 2016 remedy selection, a remedial design was initiated to begin drafting implementation of the selected remedy. The remedial design was completed in 2021. The first phase of remedial action is planned for award by September 2023.

**OU9 - Tar Creek Watershed:** This OU addresses contaminated surface water in streams of the Spring River Basin as a part of the Tri-State Mining District Watersheds that connect three states and two EPA Regions 6 and 7. The EPA has completed a Remedial Investigation report for the Lower Spring River Basin which includes OU9. This report analyzed contamination from unconsolidated mine waste that has been released or is being released into the watersheds creeks, streams, and adjacent floodplain soils. Currently, the EPA is addressing contaminated sediments from OU9 under OU4 as established under the August 2024 Explaination of Significant Differences.

Technical documents for the ongoing investigations within the watersheds are available on the Site Documents & Data section of this site profile page, under Reports and Documents, link for OU2/OU9 Technical Documents.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Areas with capped wastes are subject to use limitations. Currently, there are several Environmental Use Controls in place on specific properties throughout the site. The EUCs are managed by KDHE under their Environmental Use Control Program in the Long-Term Stewardship and Brownfields Unit.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The EPA continues to sample properties throughout the site. Monitoring of surface water and sediment is ongoing for the responsible party remedy at OU3 and for the EPA-lead work at OU5. For more information, please contact EPA Site Contacts on this page.
