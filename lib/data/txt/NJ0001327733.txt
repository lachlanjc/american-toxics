### Background

The Grand Street Mercury site is located at 720 and 722-732 Grand Street in Hoboken, New Jersey. The site included two buildings and an asphalt-covered parking area. One of the buildings was a five-story industrial building later converted into 16 residential studio spaces. A four-story adjoining townhouse was slated for residential conversion as well, but was never converted. Both buildings were demolished as part of the site’s cleanup.

The area includes a former industrial building converted into 16 residential studio spaces (722-732 Grand Street), a townhouse formerly used for various purposes, which was also intended for residential conversion (720 Grand Street), and an adjacent asphalt-covered parking lot. Mercury, believed to be associated with the use of vacuum pumps containing mercury and the manufacture of mercury vapor lamps and mercury-containing switches, was prevalent throughout the buildings and the parking lot. Mercury vapor lamps and numerous other types of lamps requiring lesser amounts of mercury in the manufacturing process were made at a facility on site from 1910 to about 1965.

The site was contaminated as a result of over 50 years of production of mercury vapor lamps and mercury connector switches. Free flowing liquid elemental mercury was observed between flooring layers throughout the former industrial building. Mercury vapors were detected throughout both on-site buildings above health-based concentrations. Mercury was also observed to have adsorbed to porous wood, brick and tar surfaces throughout the former industrial building. A site study determined that mercury was widespread and the buildings could not be remediated for residential use.

After initial actions to protect human health and the environment, and additional investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1997. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the National Priorities List in August 2007.

All planned remedial actions for the site have been completed. Under current conditions at the site, potential or actual human exposures are under control. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in August 2007.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Initial Actions: A short-term cleanup, called a removal action, temporarily relocated affected residents from the metallic mercury and mercury vapors, investigated the extent of mercury contamination at the site, provided 24-hour security, maintained the buildings to prevent exposure to the elements, and prevented further off-site migration of mercury.

Long-term Cleanup: Following investigations to determine the nature and extent of contamination at the site, EPA selected the long-term remedy in the site’s September 1997 Record of Decision, or ROD. It included permanent relocation of residents from the site; demolition of the two contaminated buildings; sampling, excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil at EPA-approved facilities; and groundwater and off-site soil monitoring to assess potential impacts to groundwater attributable to the site.  

EPA updated the ROD in April 2003, changing the soil remedy to include removal and off-site disposal of all soils on the adjacent properties found to contain mercury at levels greater than 23 parts per million (ppm) and restoration of the adjacent properties to their pre-construction conditions. The soil remedy was modified again in July 2004 to provide for additional soil excavation and off-site disposal. Subsurface soils at the site located below the water table with an average mercury concentration of 520 ppm, which could pose a potential risk to an on-site utility worker, would be dug up and disposed of off site. EPA updated the ROD a third time in September 2005. No action for the underlying groundwater was needed. Sampling found it did not pose a risk to human health or the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site was addressed in two phases: initial actions to protect human health and a long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.

To date, all property interests at the Site have been acquired by the government, and all moves have been completed. In total, fifteen families and twenty-two businesses have been successfully relocated. Two containers of waste material, one of which was determined to be RCRA hazardous waste, were removed from the Site in January 1998 and disposed of off-site. Demolition of the townhouse and former industrial building at the Site by the PRP began in March 2002, under EPA oversight, and was completed by the summer of 2003. Additional soil samples were collected in private yards in the vicinity of the Site in the summer 2001, the results of which indicated that four properties had elevated levels of mercury in soils. The PRP completed excavation and disposal of these soils at an appropriate off-site location. The properties were subsequently restored with clean fill. Remedial work on residual soil contamination on-site was initiated in September 2004 and completed in December 2004.

All planned remedial actions for the site have been completed. Under current conditions at the site, potential or actual human exposures are under control. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in August 2007.

After completion of the remedial action, the site was redeveloped into residential buildings by private parties.A Five Year Review to evalaute the protectiveness of the remedy was completed in 2024.
