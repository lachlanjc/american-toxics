### Background

The 24-acre Hechimovich Sanitary Landfill site (also known as the Land and Gas Reclamation Landfill) is located in Williamstown, Wisconsin. The area is a former municipal and industrial waste landfill that operated from about 1959 to 1986. The landfill accepted some hazardous wastes and liquid industrial wastes were placed in unlined pits. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Initial cleanup, which included installing a landfill cap and a gas collection system, was completed in 1992. Because of their success, EPA and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) determined that no further source control action was needed. The final groundwater cleanup decision was to continue with source control actions and determine, through long-term groundwater monitoring, if these actions will clean up the contamination. If the source control actions don’t clean up the groundwater, EPA and WDNR will modify the original decision.

The agencies have conducted four five-year reviews of the site’s cleanup. These reviews ensure that the cleanup is protecting public health and the environment. As discussed in the 2014 review, the understanding of site conditions changed dramatically in 2009. It was learned that there is deeper, previously unknown groundwater contamination in bedrock leaving the landfill property to the northeast. This contamination has been moving and affecting two private drinking water wells. It seems likely that the source was a mixture of chemicals in a heavy liquid form. Because this liquid is so heavy, it tends to sink when it enters groundwater. But, this liquid has since dissolved. Contamination continues to move with the groundwater.

Additional sampling is ongoing to determine the nature and extent of the deeper groundwater contaminant area. Because it appears unlikely that the source of the bedrock contamination can be addressed through an active cleanup, future response actions at the site will primarily involve monitoring and mitigation of current and future water supply impacts. As an interim public health protection measure, bottled drinking water has been provided to two homes with contaminant levels exceeding state and federal drinking water standards. One of the homes was a rental unit and has been vacated. The permanent water supply solution for the second home is a treatment system on the existing well with ongoing monthly monitoring.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has completed a [five-year review of the Hechimovich Sanitary Landfill site.](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/947944.pdf ) (PDF) (106pp, yy K23mb, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This was the fifth review of the site.

This review included an evaluation of background information, cleanup requirements, effectiveness of the cleanup, and maintenance and monitoring efforts. It also looked at ways to operate more efficiently.

The review found the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. The next scheduled review will be in 2024.
