Background
Site Background The 29-acre Madisonville Creosote Works site is located in Madisonville, Louisiana. A creosote wood-treating facility began operations on site in 1956 or 1957. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following construction of the site’s remedy, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. National Priorities Listing (NPL) History
Proposed Date: June 17, 1996
Final Date: December 23, 1996 Location: The site consists of a defunct creosote wood treating facility and covers about 29 acres in Section 42, Township 7S, Range 10E, St. Tammany Parish, in southeastern Louisiana. It is adjacent to the southern side of Louisiana State Highway 22, about 3 miles west of downtown Madisonville and 1.25 miles from the Madisonville city limits. The approximate geographical center of the Site is at 30° 25’38” north latitude and 90° 11’55” west longitude as measured from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute series topographic quadrangle for Madisonville, Louisiana. The address of the property is 1421 West Highway 22, Madisonville, Louisiana 70447. Population: 500 residents within 1 mile radius
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site? The site is being addressed through federal and state actions. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires maintenance of the dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) recovery trenches, pump vaults, pumps, and wastewater treatment plant; ongoing groundwater monitoring; installation of security fencing around the DNAPL recovery trenches and wastewater treatment plant; and continued enforcement of access restrictions. Prior to the establishment of wood-treating operations, the site was mostly forested land with a farmstead of about 5.5 acres along the western property boundary. Wood-preserving operations at the site began in 1956 or 1957 under the name Madisonville Creosote Works, Inc. Operations included treating poles, ties, and lumber by impregnating the wood with creosote. The waste streams generated during these operations included process water, cooling water, boiler water and waste creosote. Since at least 1974, the facility used two unlined process water ditches and two unlined ponds to convey and store process waste liquids and sludges. Waste creosote and wastewater drained from the treatment cylinders to the large process ditch. The small process ditch conveyed waste liquids from the large process ditch to former process water pond. The solids settled and water overflowed through a depression in the earthen dike separating the ponds and into an evaporation pond. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality closed the ponds, and the process water ditches between 1984 and 1986.

What Is the Current Site Status?
What Is the Current Site Status
The site is currently in operation & maintenance status. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) operates the dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) recovery trench system and performs routine monitoring. The EPA, LDEQ, and St. Tammany Parish have explored recreational reuse scenarios for future use of the property. The site is ready for limited reuse. The DNAPL recovery trench system continues to operate. An estimated 23,484.50 gallons of creosote have been recovered as of March 2024.
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Activity and Use Limitations The One of the remedies selected in the 1998 ROD required that institutional controls be implemented to provide notice to current and future owners that extraction and use of the contaminated groundwater in the saturated zones should be avoided. In August 2004, a Conveyance Notice was filed with the St. Tammany Parish Clerk of Court Land Records to provide notice of Site conditions and notice that the Site was closed with contaminant levels in place that are acceptable for industrial/commercial use. Currently there are no plans for reuse at this time.
Sampling and Monitoring
 Sampling and Monitoring  The DNAPL recovery and treatment system began operating in 2000. As of March 2024, approximately 23,484.50 gallons of DNAPL have been recovered, 2,194,318 gallons of groundwater have been extracted, and 2,086,101 gallons of liquids have been treated and discharged to the North Ditch. During this FYR period, operators recovered an average of about 24 gallons of DNAPL per month. Wastewater treatment system effluent is sampled monthly and analyzed for semi-volatile organic chemicals (SVOCs), volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and other parameters.
Emergency Response and Removal
 Emergency Response and Removal Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. A removal action in 1996 included demolition, consolidation and/or disposal of 11 site buildings and their contents (including drums of oil waste), the process area (including 15 storage tanks and their contents, three treatment cylinders, asbestos insulation, mercury-contaminated debris, and the concrete), piles of treated wood, and steel railroad tracks. The action included installation of a fence around part of the site.
