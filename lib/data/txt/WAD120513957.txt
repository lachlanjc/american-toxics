### Background

The 10-acre Pesticide Lab (Yakima) site is an active agricultural research laboratory located at the Yakima Agricultural Research Laboratory (YARL) in Yakima, Yakima County, Washington. The research laboratory, originally an orchard, has been in operation since 1961.The site is leased by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Wastes from the pesticide storage/formulation/mixing facility were discharged into a septic tank disposal system at the site from 1965 to 1985. Since the site is an active facility, the USDA addressed cleanup under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The site has been cleaned up and is no longer a threat to human health. Long-term monitoring is not required.

Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1993.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1992, EPA selected a “no further action” remedy for the site, as well as one year of groundwater monitoring.

Cleanup Progress

Site cleanup included removal actions to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1980, the Yakima Agricultural Research Laboratory (YARL) received interim status under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). However, in 1983, unpermitted discharges led to EPA investigations that revealed evidence of soil and potential groundwater contamination from leaching of contaminants. In 1988, YARL removed the drain field and sampled soil and groundwater. In 1990, additional wells were added to further facilitate groundwater assessment.

EPA approved a RCRA Closure Plan in 1990. The plan included removing and disposal of septic tank contents; excavating and removing of the tanks and washdown pad; collecting background soil samples; excavating and removing contaminated soil; collecting confirmation samples around the removed structures; installing three groundwater monitoring wells; and a year of groundwater sampling. YARL completed site cleanup activities, leaving no contaminants of concern affecting the site.
