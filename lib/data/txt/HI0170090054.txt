The Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Eastern Pacific site consists of operating facilities throughout Oahu, Hawaii. Most of the sites are land disposal areas that are no longer in use and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) transformer sites. Site activities contaminated soil with PCBs, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and metals. The Navy selected remedies for several sites and has begun cleanup activities.
