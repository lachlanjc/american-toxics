### Background

The Price Battery plant operated in the Borough of Hamburg, Berks County, Pa., from approximately 1940 to the mid-1990s. Hamburg is located at the foot of the Blue Mountains along the Schuylkill River. The site, about 1.2 square miles in size, is located in a mixed commercial/residential area in the vicinity of the former Price Battery facility. During operations, battery casings were broken open and the lead plates were removed for smelting. The on-site lead smelter, which was dismantled in 1971, produced emissions from its stack that contaminated the residential areas around the facility. In addition to the lead emissions, lead-contaminated battery waste and casings were used as fill material throughout the Borough of Hamburg. The site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in April 2005. A majority of the site has been remediated, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

The site was addressed in the following concurrent stages:

1. Immediate cleanup of the residential exteriors and interiors;
2. Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) to determine the exact nature and extent of contamination throughout the community (Operable Unit -1);
3. RI/FS to determine the nature and extent of contamination at the Price Battery plant (Operable Unit - 2); and
4. RI/FS to determine the exact nature and extent of contamination in Kaercher and Mill Creeks that may be attributable to the former Price Battery Plant (Operable Unit - 3).

In November 2002, EPA started cleanup of residential properties with lead above action levels under EPA removal authority.  
  
In the fall of 2005, EPA started the RI/FS for OU-1 to determine the exact nature and complete extent of the lead contamination throughout the community. As part of that RI/FS, an air dispersion model showed that lead emissions may have been deposited throughout the Borough of Hamburg. EPA issued an [Interim Record of Decision (ROD)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2101297) in September 2009 to address the cleanup at the remaining residential properties. The selected interim remedy for OU-1 included soil excavation and specialized interior cleaning to remove lead-contaminated soils and dust from residential properties, consistent with the ongoing removal actions.

EPA completed the cleanup of approximately 555 residential properties in Hamburg, Berks County, PA that were determined to be contaminated with lead. Both interior and exterior cleanups were performed to protect people from exposure to lead in soils and lead dust in residences. A registry was provided to the Borough of Hamburg consistent with the institutional control requirements of the 2009 ROD, identifying which properties are unremediated or have been remediated. This registry supplements existing Pennsylvania real estate transfer disclosure requirements and ensures that potential buyers are aware of potential contamination.  
  
Exide demolished the plant and disposed of its debris by late winter 2008, and began the RI/FS field work in September 2008.  
  
In September 2015, EPA issued a Final [ROD (PDF)](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2218270) detailing EPA's method for the cleanup of OU-1 (residential), which was "No Further Action" based on the cleanups that had taken place. The ROD also detailed the cleanup of OU-2 (facility portion), which includes the former Price Battery facility and Kaercher Creek on the facility property.

The remedial design for the facility cleanup (OU-2) was completed in June 2018. Remedial cleanup work at the former facility began in September 2018 and was completed in September 2019. The cleanup consisted of the excavation of contaminated soils at the property. During this work, 7,975 cubic yards of lead-contaminated soils were excavated and disposed of in an approved off-site disposal facility. The excavated area was then backfilled with clean material. Removal of lead-contaminated sediment from the facility portion of Kaercher Creek, stabilization of the creek bed, and installation of a new sheet pile wall were also completed. Restrictions to limit land use will be implemented for the properties in the near future. Throughout this effort, controls such as continuous air monitoring were utilized to ensure the community was protected while the work took place.

In June 2023, EPA issued a [ROD](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2349412) for OU-3. The ROD documents EPA's cleanup that will include the excavation of contaminated sediment in Mill Creek and Kaercher Creek and soils in the Kaercher Creek floodplain that exceed EPA’s cleanup levels for lead, arsenic, and antimony.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA continues to monitor on-site groundwater to ensure the quality is stable or improving.

EPA completed the second five-year review for the Price Battery Site in August 2020. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by Site decision documents. The [2020 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2306147) determined that the remedy is protective in the short-term as there is no current exposure to site-related contaminants.The next five-year review is scheduled for 2025.

On June 28, 2023, EPA issued a [Record of Decision (ROD)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2349412) for Operable Unit 3 (OU-3) of the Price Battery Lead Smelter Superfund Site. A ROD documents the cleanup plan decided by EPA. This ROD documents EPA’s cleanup plans to address contaminated surface water, soil, and sediment in Mill Creek and Kaercher Creek. EPA’s cleanup will include the excavation of contaminated sediment in Mill Creek and Kaercher Creek and soils in the Kaercher Creek floodplain that exceed EPA’s cleanup levels for lead, arsenic, and antimony.EPA is also investigating and studying the contaminated sediment in Kaercher and Mill Creeks and will share the proposed cleanup plan with the community once it has been determined.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls are in place for the site. EPA provided a registry to the Borough of Hamburg identifying both remediated and unremediated properties (where access for cleanup was not granted). The Borough uses the registry during its property transfer inspection process and notifies potential buyers about the cleanup status of each property. There are also controls in place at each of the former facility properties. Additional information about the institutional controls can be found in the [August 2020 Five-Year Review (pages 16-19).](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2306147)

### Sampling and Monitoring

EPA has collected many years' worth of data and information about the Price Battery Site. Information about the site can be found in the [Records Collection.](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/collection/03/SC30820)

### Emergency Response and Removal

In 2002 EPA’s Removal Program assessed:

1. Surface and subsurface soil, air, groundwater and waste at the plant.
2. Surface soil and the interiors of residences located east of the plant.

In November 2002, EPA initiated a removal cleanup on residential properties that had lead levels above EPA’s cleanup action level.

### Enforcement Information

In June 2003, EPA signed an Administrative Order on Consent with Exide Technologies to perform a removal cleanup at the plant.

In May 2007, EPA and Exide signed a second Consent Order for Exide to perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study on all Exide-owned properties, including the former Price Battery plant itself.

In March 2016, EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order to Exide to perform the Remedial Design/Remedial Action on all Exide-owned properties, including the former Price Battery plant itself.
