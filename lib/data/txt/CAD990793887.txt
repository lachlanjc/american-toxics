### Background

The Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (Salinas Plant) site is located in Monterey County, California. It consists of a 43-acre former tire manufacturing plant on a 256-acre parcel of land. The site is an industrial park containing warehouses. Firestone operated a tire manufacturing plant on the site from 1965 to 1980. Production chemicals apparently were spilled during the manufacturing process. Contamination at the site was first discovered in 1983, during the plant closing. Following construction of the site’s long-term remedy, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2005. Groundwater treatment is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Construction of all cleanup remedies has been completed. Removal and capping of the contaminated soil and extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater have reduced the potential of exposure to contaminants at the site while final groundwater treatment activities are underway.  

EPA took the site off the NPL in 2005.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Contaminated soil was removed from 1983 to 1984. Soil capping took place in 1984 and 1985. On- and off-site shallow aquifers were treated in 1986 and 1987.
