### Background

The 27-acre Fourth Street Abandoned Refinery site is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. An oil refinery operated at the site from the early 1940s through the early 1960s. Refinery activities and waste disposal activities contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2008. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state and federal actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

The on-site refinery collected, stored and re-refined used oils and distributed the recycled product. Refinery operations included the use of sulfuric acid to clarify the used oil. Sludge generated by the reclamation process was disposed of in on-site impoundments.The on-site refinery collected, stored and re-refined used oils and distributed the recycled product.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included excavation, consolidation, stabilization and off-site disposal of contaminated materials; demolition of on-site structures and disposal of associated asbestos insulation as necessary; landfill maintenance; and groundwater monitoring around the landfill perimeter. Additional cleanup actions included installation of warning signs to require notification prior to drilling in the area; institutional controls; groundwater monitoring; routine inspections to make sure that the public does not use water from the upper zone of the Garber-Wellington Aquifer prior to attainment of groundwater cleanup goals; and contingency measures (including active treatment) if groundwater monitoring indicated increased contaminant concentrations. Remedy construction took place between 1994 and 1996. Ongoing operation and maintenance activities include maintaining institutional controls and conducting semi-annual searches of well-drilling records to ensure that no one drills drinking water wells on or near the site.

Groundwater monitoring results between 1996 and 2003 determined that contaminant levels were decreasing and that groundwater in the vicinity of the site is not used as a water supply. Based on these results, EPA and the state determined that groundwater monitoring is no longer required. The state plugged all monitoring wells in 2005. EPA issued an Explanation of Significant Difference (ESD) in 2006 documenting the change in the site’s remedy to discontinue groundwater monitoring.

Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2008.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions in 1989 included construction of a fence around contaminated areas and placement of warning signs.
