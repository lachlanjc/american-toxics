### Background

The Lindsay Manufacturing Company site is located in Lindsay, Nebraska. Lindsay Manufacturing Company generated sulfuric acid waste from a galvanizing process at its plant. The wastes were discharged into an unlined pond for 10 years. Use of the pond ceased in 1983, when three groundwater monitoring wells showed contamination. In addition, chlorinated solvents associated with metal parts cleaning and degreasing were discharged to the ground at the site, releasing VOCs to the environment which subsequently migrated into the groundwater beneath the facility. The site is bordered by the town of Lindsay and surrounded by predominately agricultural land. Groundwater is used for agricultural purposes and as a drinking water supply for nearby residents. Approximately 3,000 people live within a three-mile radius of the site, with the nearest residence 300 feet away. In April 1992, a Consent Decree was signed that required the potentially responsible party (PRP), Lindsay Manufacturing, to design and implement the remedy and clean up the site under the oversight of the EPA and the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy (NDEE). The EPA is the lead agency.

Groundwater and soils at the site are contaminated with volatile organic compounds, 1,4-dioxane and heavy metals. While a remedial action is in place at the site to control groundwater migration downgradient, potential source identification, cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and groundwater monitoring are ongoing at the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and PRP actions.

The EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews evaluate whether the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review in 2018 concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires reassessment of the current site conditions, defining and remediating source areas and evaluating the performance of the groundwater extraction system. The next Five-Year Review is scheduled in 2028.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 2008, the EPA determined that additional cleanup activities were necessary. The PRP delineated the groundwater plume, installed groundwater monitoring wells, analyzed source areas and conducted on-site vapor intrusion sampling. The extent of the groundwater contamination is delineated. Vapor intrusion was investigated at buildings on site and at residences downgradient of the site and does not present an unacceptable risk to the occupants. Source identification under Building 1 is ongoing. In the fall of 2017, the PRP performed additional sampling in the ditch to further delinate the contaminated zone. In January 2020, the PRP notifed the EPA that they are considering using In Situ Thermal Remediation System to remediate the source areas within the manufacturing footprint. Lindsay Manufacturing Company implemented a pilot study for in situ thermal remediation to address the site contamination. Lindsay Manufacturing Company submitted the pilot study work plan to both the EPA and the Nebraska Department of Energy and Environment for review and comment.The thermal system was 100% installed in November 2022. It heated the subsurface to desired temprature to treat contaminants, and was turned off in July 2023. There will be two years of confirmation sampling to determine the effectiveness of the pilot study. The pilot study is 100% funded by Lindsay Manufacturing Company.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

As of January 2020, the PRP, the NDEE and the EPA are collectively working on language for institutional controls which includes activity and use limitations.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The PRP conducts quarterly groundwater sampling.
