### Background

The 2.6-acre Novaco Industries (Novaco) site is located in Temperance, Michigan. The now-dissolved Novaco Industries was a tool-and-die manufacturing and repair facility. In June 1979, a tank of chromic acid used for plating operations developed a leak; an unknown quantity spilled onto the ground. The spill resulted in groundwater contamination and affected several drinking water wells. These wells were replaced. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1998.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included a five-year groundwater monitoring period that began in 1993. The final sampling event took place in August 1997. Sampling results demonstrated that chromium levels were below levels of concern, and the site received EPA approval for "No Further Action." In 1998, EPA took the site off the NPL.
