### Background

The Sheller-Globe Corporation Disposal site, also known as the Grimes Property site, is located in Keokuk, Lee County, Iowa. The seven-acre site includes a primary disposal area and secondary disposal area known as the North Hill disposal area. The primary disposal area is a 6.6-acre portion of the site bordered by Airport Road (340th Street) to the south, 260th Avenue to the west and two unnamed intermittent streams to the north and east. The North Hill disposal area is located on a small hill east of 260th Avenue approximately one-quarter of a mile north of Airport Road.

From 1948 until 1972, waste materials were hauled to the primary disposal area of the site from the former Sheller-Globe plant in Keokuk, Iowa. The Sheller-Globe plant manufactured various rubber products and automobile parts. The waste material brought to the site for disposal consisted of rubber, wood, paper, plastics and drums of various solvents and paint sludge. The wastes were periodically burned and then bulldozed over the hillsides from the ridge. Some of the materials were buried; others were spread across the property.

The selected remedial action to address site contaminants includes land use restrictions, demolition of the house and shed located on-site, removal of drums, construction of a soil and vegetative cover over the exposed ash and routine inspection and maintenance of the soil and vegetative cover. Land use in the vicinity of the site is predominantly pasture and forest land with scattered farms and residences. The site is currently vacant and composed of grasses and trees.

Following completion of the response actions, the EPA deleted the site from the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) in 1990. Routine inspection and maintenance of the soil and vegetative covers are ongoing. The fourth Five-Year Review was of this site was completed in June of 2020 (available under "Site Documents and Data"). Five-Year Reviews provide an opportunity to evaluate the site remedy to determine whether it remains protective of human health and the environment. The fourth Five-Year Review found that a protectiveness determination of the remedy at this site could not be made until the EPA obtains further information regarding potential risk to ecological receptors. A Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment was completed in October 2021 to determine if further action is needed to mitigate ecological risks. An Addendum to the fourth Five-Year Review was completed in December 2022 (available under "Site Documents and Data"). This Addendum updates the protectiveness determination of the remedy at the site and includes a copy of the Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment. The sitewide remedy is protective of human health and the environment.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The long-term remedy selected for the primary disposal area of the site included restrictive covenants/deed restrictions to limit future land use to non-residential and prohibit disturbance of the surface or subsurface of the property; demolition of a house and shed on the property; removal of exposed drums; construction of a vegetative cap over the exposed ash and house basement; and inspection and maintenance of the soil covers. The site was addressed through federal and potentially responsible party actions. Response actions were completed in 1999.

The EPA selected a “no further action” remedy for surface water, sediments and groundwater at the site because they do not pose significant risks to human health. Routine inspection and maintenance of the site ensures the remedy remains protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA has conducted four Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews evaluate whether the remedies put in place protect human health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. The Fourth Five-Year Review found that a protectiveness determination of the remedy at this site cannot be made at this time until further information is obtained due to potential risk to ecological receptors. Further information was obtained by conducting an updated Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment. An Addendum to the Fourth Five-Year Review was completed in December 2022 and the protectiveness determination was updated. The sitewide remedy is protective of human health and the environment.
