Background
The 40-acre Northern Engraving Co. site is an active manufacturing facility which produces metal name plates, dials and decorative trim for the automotive industry. Processes used at the facility include anodizing, chemical etching and chromate conversion coating. Wastewater treatment and disposal practices in the 1960s led to soil and groundwater contamination.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site’s long-term cleanup, which was paid for by the companies determined to be responsible for the contamination, included: excavating and consolidating sludge and soil from certain areas and placing it in a sludge lagoon, which was capped backfilling and covering a seepage pit with native soil monitoring groundwater implementing institutional controls such as imposing access and deed restrictions EPA took the site off its Superfund list in 1997.  In 2000, EPA and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources approved the end of groundwater monitoring and the abandonment of monitoring wells. EPA subsequently issued a Sitewide Ready for Anticipated Use (SWRAU) determination in 2013. The SWRAU verifies that all cleanup goals for soil and groundwater have been met so current and reasonably anticipated future land uses won’t be affected and that all required land use and groundwater controls have been put in place. The companies continue to maintain the site property as well as the capped and covered areas.

What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA completed a review of the site's cleanup(PDF) (104pp, 42.14MB, About PDF) This type of review is required at least every five years where the cleanup is complete but hazardous waste remains managed on-site. These reviews are done to ensure that the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.  It was the sixth five-year review for this site.                         The review included an evaluation of: 
Site background information
Cleanup requirements
Effectiveness of the cleanup and any anticipated future actions
Maintenance and monitoring efforts
Possible ways of operating the site more efficiently 
The review found the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. The next scheduled review will be in 2025.
