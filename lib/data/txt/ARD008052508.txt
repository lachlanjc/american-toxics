### Background

**Current Status**

In 2003, EPA set up a monitoring program to make sure no contaminants are leaving the site boundary (defined by the railroad tracks). The flow direction for the shallow ground water to be monitored is toward north east i.e. from the site plume toward Bayou de Loutre. The monitoring plan was handled by Corps of Engineers (COE), New Orleans District. COE contracted with Materials Management Group (MMG) of New Orleans to start sampling. MMG collected samples in January 2004 had them analyzed by February 2004. Preliminary results did not conclusively show any breakthrough of the plume beyond the site boundary.

**Site Background**

The 41-acre Popile, Inc. site is located in El Dorado, Arkansas. A wood-treating facility operated on site from 1947 to 1982. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil, surface water, groundwater and sediment with hazardous chemicals. Site drainage enters Bayou de Loutre. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. Soil and groundwater treatments have prevented contamination from migrating off site.  
  
EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires enforcement of institutional controls, restoration of a fence and implementation of additional measures to prevent public access to the site, removal of trees to prevent damaged to capped areas, and ongoing groundwater monitoring.

In 1947, El Dorado Creosote Co., the parent company of Popile, Inc., began treating wood at the 40-acre property using PCP and creosote. El Dorado Pole and Piling Company purchased the property in 1956 and began using three surface impoundments as part of the wastewater treatment process in 1976. Wood-treating operations ceased in July 1982. In September 1982, Popile bought about 72 acres of the property, including the surface impoundments and a large area known as the Salt Flat. In 1984, Popile closed the three impoundments.

There are residential properties on two sides of the site and industrial/commercial properties on the other two sides. No drinking water wells are located within two miles of the site. Site drainage enters Bayou de Loutre.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included monitored natural attenuation, a soil cap, fencing, warning signs, erosion controls and institutional controls. Implementation of the cleanup finished in 1998. Results of a 1998 to 2000 subsurface investigation and groundwater model study indicated no migration of contaminants off site and no threat to Bayou de Loutre. Therefore, EPA concluded that further remedial action is unnecessary. Operation and maintenance activities, including groundwater monitoring, are ongoing. Further cleanup will occur if the contaminant plume expands toward the Bayou.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions from 1990 to 1991 included stabilizing contaminated soils and sludge, grading and shaping the site surface for erosion control, capping a temporary impoundment area, installing steel culverts in a drainage area, placing topsoil and seeding the entire site, installing a security fence, and posting warning signs.
