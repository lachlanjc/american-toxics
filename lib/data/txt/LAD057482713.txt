### Background

The 77-acre Petro-Processors of Louisiana, Inc. site (PPI) is located in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana. The site includes two sub-areas, the Scenic site and the Brooklawn site. The Brooklawn site includes the disposal area with the former lagoons and pits and a portion of Bayou Baton Rouge. The Scenic site was a borrow pit for the construction of the overpass at the intersection of U.S. Highway 61 and State Highway 964; it also includes the former disposal area and a portion of Bayou Baton Rouge.

PPI operated these sites as depositories for various petrochemical wastes during the 1960s and the 1970s. These operations contaminated surface soil, surface water, groundwater, air and airborne particulate matter with hazardous chemicals.

The site is located over the “400-foot sands,” a major drinking water aquifer.

  
The nearest residence is about 3,000 feet from the site, and the nearest drinking water well is 3,000 feet upgradient of the site. The community is predominately rural. About 435 people live within two miles of the Brooklawn site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

.

The site is being addressed through federal, state and Potentially Responsible parties (PRPs), a.k.a. “Industry Defendants”, actions. The site remedy follows the “Conceptual Closure Plan”, agreed by the PRPs under a Consent Decree signed in the United States Middle District Court of Louisiana in 1983, as amended by a “Supplemental Remedial Action Plan” in 1989.

EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review, completed in 2015, concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term.

These remedies are anticipated to be protective in the long term with the future implementation of enhanced attenuation at the source area and within the contaminant plume at the Scenic site.  
  
The rerouting of Bayou Baton Rouge and the engineered clay caps covering the Brooklawn and Scenic sites reduced the migration of contaminants and prevented air emissions from the source areas as well as exposure to nearby industries and residences. Continued research, assessment and modeling ensure that remedy implementation is successful. Risk assessment work ensures that the technologies implemented at the sites are protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The long-term remedy at the Brooklawn site includes source reduction, protective fill and biota monitoring, monitored natural attenuation of contaminated groundwater, and administrative controls.

The long-term remedy at the Scenic site includes source control, natural recovery of sediments, monitored natural attenuation of contaminated groundwater and administrative controls.

Currently the disposal area of both former disposal sites has been backfilled, capped, graded, and seeded. Groundwater monitoring at both sites is ongoing.

Construction of the remedy finished in 2003. Enhanced attenuation activities at the Scenic site began with the injection of molasses to enhance biological activity in 2011.

Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. Further modeling, monitoring, reinjection of molasses, treatment of groundwater at the distal end of the plume, and inspection activities continue to ensure protection of human health and the environment.
