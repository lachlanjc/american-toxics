### Background

The 15-acre Toftdahl Drum site is in Brush Prairie, four miles east-southeast of Battleground, Washington. Mr. Toftdahl used the site in the early 1970s to clean used drums for resale. He received drums containing industrial waste allegedly from a plywood manufacturer. Some of the drums that could not be cleaned were crushed, placed in a trench and covered with dirt. The new property owners rediscovered buried drums on the site in 1970 when they were leveling the ground over the trench. The buried drums contaminated soil, groundwater and surface water with heavy metals and polychlorinated biphenyls ( [PCBs](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=PCB) ). Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1988.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

The three main areas of the site where hazardous substance handling activities may have occurred are a drum cleaning area, an initial burial trench and a final drum burial area. The surface of the site slopes downward to the northwest to a spring and a small westerly flowing tributary of Morgan Creek, or to the southeast directly to Morgan Creek.

General land use in the area is rural residential, with 14 homes in the 90 acres between NE 189th Street and Morgan Creek. Most of these homes obtain their water from wells that are screened at least 70 feet below the surface. The natural vegetation at the site is dense and consists of a mixture of second-growth coniferous forest and brushy cut-over areas. Access to these homes and to the site is via an unpaved road.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA selected the site’s long-term remedy in 1986. It included no further action with groundwater and surface water monitoring. EPA revised the plan in 1997 to reduce the length of post-remediation monitoring.

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1988. EPA did not require Five-Year Reviews for the site because land or groundwater use restrictions were not required as part of the cleanup plan.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1978 or 1982, Mr. Toftdahl removed 38 drums from the site. In 1983, EPA sampled six leaking drums, capped the drums and placed them in an excavation trench lined with polyethylene. Fencing was installed around the excavated area. Three additional drums were found in a second excavation and were placed in the fenced area.

In 1984, five potential burial locations were identified outside the fence and one area inside the fence. A total of 20 pits were excavated. In 1985, EPA contractors removed all drums and visibly contaminated soils (primarily paint chips) and disposed of them off site.
