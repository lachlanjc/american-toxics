### Background

The LaGrand Sanitary Landfill is a five-acre landfill located in a rural setting in west-central Douglas County, Minnesota approximately eight miles west of the town of Alexandria and approximately three miles south of the town of Garfield. The landfill accepted mixed municipal solid waste for disposal from 1974 to 1985. The landfill was closed in 1985 and was listed on the National Priorities List for cleanup. In 1993, MPCA improved the landfill cap and installed groundwater and landfill gas monitoring points. The site was deleted from the NPL in 1997.  
  
The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency currently oversees operation and maintenance of the site's remedy under its Closed Landfill Program.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency selected a cleanup plan for the landfill in 1992. The plan was implemented by MPCA in 1993. It included covering exposed wastes, installing groundwater and landfill gas monitoring points, and controlling future use of the property. The site was deleted from the NPL in 1997. In 1998, Douglas County transferred ownership of the property to MPCA. In 2008, MPCA transferred part of the property to Runestone Electric for operation of an electric substation. MPCA managed the cleanup and continues to maintain the landfill. In 2006, MPCA upgraded the landfill by installing a new cap and new gas vents.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Currently, MPCA monitors the landfill cover and gas control system, and samples 10 groundwater monitoring wells, as part of its Closed Landfill Program. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review, conducted in 2018, concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### Sampling and Monitoring

MPCA regularly samples underground gas probes to make sure that methane gas is not moving away from the landfill. At the time of EPA’s last five-year review, no methane gas was detected in the probes. This showed that the gas venting system was operating successfully. MPCA also regularly samples groundwater at the Site. At the time of EPA’s last review, no contaminants were found in groundwater at levels above state or federal drinking water standards.
