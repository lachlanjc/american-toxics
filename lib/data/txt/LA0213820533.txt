### Background

**Current Site Status**

Five-Year Reviews are required to ensure long-term remediation controls are effective. The intent of these reviews are to evaluate how the remedy is working and is it still protective of human health and the environment.

In August 2021 the EPA made a sitewide independent finding of "protectiveness deferred" due to the lack of the Sixth Five-Year Review Report. EPA will be reporting to Congress that a protectiveness determination of the remedy at the Camp Minden Site cannot be made at this time until further information is obtained.

**Site Background**

The 14,949-acre Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant site is located near Doyline, Louisiana. It is a former military installation that the Army used to load, assemble and pack ammunitions items. Production took place intermittently from 1942 to 1994. During site operations, the Army disposed of untreated explosives-laden wastewater in on-site lagoons, contaminating soil, sediments and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following construction of the site’s interim remedy, groundwater monitoring and operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The 2016 five-year review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

In 1941, the U.S. government acquired ownership of the site. The site was a U.S. Army Armament, Munitions and Chemical Command (AMCCOM) installation used to load, assemble and pack ammunition items. Operations began in 1942 with eight ammunition lines and one ammonium nitrate graining plant. Ammunition production ceased in August 1945, at the close of World War II, and the Army placed the facility on standby. The facility began operating again in February 1951 to support the Korean conflict and all ammunitions loading lines were operational, including a metals forging and machining plant area known as the Y-Line Chromic Acid Etching Facility. The Y-Line manufactured 155-mm projectiles. In February 1958, the Army again placed the installation on standby. In September 1962, the Army reactivated the plant to support the Vietnam war with four production areas used for classified ammunition items. The facility continued ammunition production for the U.S. military until 1994. In October 1997, the Army began leasing the Y-Line facility to the Valentech Corporation.

The 16 pink water lagoons known as the Area P Lagoons were in active use between 1940 and 1981. During this time, the Army disposed of untreated explosives-laden wastewater from industrial operations in the lagoons. After numerous investigations and assessments, it was determined that the contamination in soils and sediments from the Area P lagoons was a major contributor to the groundwater contamination.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The Army selected “no further action” as the site’s long-term remedy because the intermediate remedial action had removed significant threats to human health and the environment. Groundwater monitoring and operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site cleanup included intermediate remedial actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. A remedial action from 1987 to 1990 included drainage and treatment of lagoon wastewater, soil excavation, and soil treatment by incineration. The action also backfilled excavated areas with clean soil, covered the area with a cap and installed a fence around the cap.
