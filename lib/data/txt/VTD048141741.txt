### Background

The Jard Company property is located along Bowen Road in Bennington, Bennington County, Vermont. The 34-acre property was formerly occupied by a manufacturing facility that was demolished in 2005. The property is bordered to the north by industrial properties, to the south by the Roaring Branch of the Walloomsac River, to the east by woodlands and a Vermont Agency of Transportation district garage, and to the west by baseball fields and residences.

Prior to 1969, the property was undeveloped woodland. The property was purchased in three parcels. The original 9-acre parcel was purchased in 1969. An additional 2-acre parcel was purchased in 1977. The final 23-acre parcel was purchased in 1979. From 1969 to 1989, Jard Company manufactured capacitors, non-fluid transformers, and motors used in household appliances on the property. Hazardous wastes generated during manufacturing processes included polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, including Aroclor 1242 from 1969 to 1971 and Aroclor 1016 from 1971 to 1978); bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP); paints and paint solvents; zinc oxide; methylene chloride; trichloroethylene (TCE); 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA); varnish and varnish solids; rejected capacitors; and DEHP wastewater. Two dry wells located on the property potentially received PCB- and DOP-contaminated wastewater.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

A 1991/1992 EPA Removal Action included removing chemicals stored in drums and containers on the property, pumping out dry wells and removing contaminated sediments, cleaning floor drains, removing PCB-contaminated soils, installation of a perimeter fence, and securing the building.

EPA conducted a second Removal Action in 1999 to remove PCB-contaminated surface soil.  
  
A 2006/2007 EPA Removal Action included demolishing the deteriorated Jard facility building, disposal of PCB-impacted concrete and soil located under the former facility, and placement of an earthen cap over remaining impacted areas.  
  
A 2012/2013 EPA Removal Action included removal of PCBs within the basements of two nearby residential homes, followed by decontamination of the basements and installation of engineering controls to prevent recontamination of the basements via groundwater infiltration.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA began Remedial Investigation activities at the Site in May 2016.
