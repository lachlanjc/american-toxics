### Background

The six-acre Fischer & Porter Superfund Site is an active commercial property in Warminster, Pennsylvania that was formerly owned by the Fischer & Porter Company (F&P), who manufactured flow meters and process control equipment at the location. In 1979, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), specifically trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE), were detected in local groundwater. These VOCs were found in some public water supply wells of both the Hatboro Borough and Warminster Heights Water Authorities. The Site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List in 1983, and in 1986, permanent treatment systems were installed to address contamination in the water supply wells. Hydrologic investigations found that the contamination discovered in the Hatboro Borough wells was unrelated to the Site. In 2004, Warminster Heights wells were taken out of service and shut down. Local regulations prohibit the installation of new drinking water wells.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In November 1984, a consent decree was negotiated with Fischer & Porter Company (F&P) to pump groundwater from three extraction wells in the most contaminated area of the Site. The groundwater is cleaned with an air stripper and then discharged into a tributary of Pennypack Creek adjacent to the property.  
  
In 1986, the Hatboro Borough and Warminster Heights Water Authorities installed permanent treatment systems on their public water supply wells. In 1992 as part of a remedy review, EPA commenced a further investigation of the source of contamination at the Site. Part of this investigation was also directed at determining the efficacy of the on-site pump and treat remedy operating at that time. The investigation concluded in September 1998, with a final determination that the existing water treatment systems were effectively protecting public health and that no changes to the remedy were necessary.  
  
EPA determined that a re-evaluation of the groundwater and contamination plume was necessary after Warminster Heights shutdown their public suppy wells in 2004. EPA contracted with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to conduct the re-evaluation. In 2010, USGS installed new monitoring wells on the Site and identified the current plume configuration.

Vapor intrusion occurs when vapor-forming chemicals migrate from a subsurface source into an overlying building - similar to radon gas seeping into homes. To address the potential for vapor intrusion, sampling occurred in 2013 and 2018 and determined that there are no current unacceptable risks at the Site. EPA will continue to monitor the potential for vapor intrusion.

In July 2024, the EPA issued the fifth Five-Year review for the Site. These reviews ensure the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment and function as intended by Site decision documents. The most recent concluded that the remedy is not functioning as intended and protectiveness of the remedy is deferred until additional information can be collected. Issues and Recommendations were identified in the Fischer and Porter 2024 Five-Year Review and once these issues are addressed, a protectiveness evaluation can be completed. The first step in addressing the issues and recommendations that are outlined in the Five-Year Review will involve the installation of additional groundwater monitoring wells and collecting groundwater samples to fully characterize the extent of Site-related groundwater contamination. The EPA will also be evaluating where there are any private drinking water wells in the area that may be impacted by Site-related contamination. If you have a private drinking water well and are located downgradient of the Site, please feel free to contact the Site Remedial Project Manager (Elizabeth Odren, 215-814-3150) to discuss.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Currently, contaminated groundwater is being extracted and treated prior to discharge into a nearby tributary. Monthly samples from the groundwater treatment system are collected and tested and submitted to the EPA in quarterly reports, and effluent sample results remain in compliance the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protectionâ€™s discharge requirements. Vapor intrusion studies were conducted for the commercial/industrial buildings within the Property boundary in 2013 and 2018, but no additional investigation efforts have been conducted since. To be protective in the long term, vapor intrusion must be shown to be consistently under control in all buildings in the area. The EPA will continue to monitor for the potential for vapor intrusion once the extent of Site-related groundwater contamination is fully characterized to ensure all potentially impacted areas are evaluated for vapor intrusion.

In addition to the monthly treatment system sample collection, groundwater monitoring is conducted every five years at the Site. Groundwater samples are collected from a set of three groundwater monitoring wells that are located downgradient of the Property boundary (i.e., to the north and northwest of the Property). Site-related contaminants have been slowly decreasing over time; however, some Site-related contaminants of concern continue to exceed Site-related clean-up goals in all of the groundwater monitoring wells. Additionally, the treatment system influent results indicate there are still elevated levels of Site-related contaminants in the source area. Because of this, the extent of Site-related groundwater contamination is undefined, and Site-related contaminants in the source area still exceed Site-related clean-up goals, indicating the remedy is not functioning as intended.

The EPA has conducted Five-Year Reviews on this Site since 2003. These reviews ensure the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment and function as intended by Site decision documents. The most recent [2024 Five-Year Review (PDF](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2389222.pdf) ) deferred protectiveness of the remedy since there are several outstanding data gaps that do not allow for an adequate determination to be made with respect to the protectives of human health and the environment. Issues and Recommendations were identified in the Fischer and Porter 2024 Five-Year Review and once these issues are addressed, a protectiveness evaluation can be completed. The first step in addressing the Issues and Recommendations that are identified in the Five-Year Review will involve the installation of additional groundwater monitoring wells and collecting groundwater samples to fully characterize the extent of Site-related groundwater contamination. The EPA will also be evaluating where there are any private drinking water wells in the area that may be impacted by Site-related contamination. Once additional data are collected and evaluated, the EPA will complete a Five-Year Review addendum that will document a protectiveness determination.
