### Background

The Pfohl Brothers Landfill site is located in Cheektowaga, New York, approximately one mile east of the Buffalo Niagara International Airport. The privately-owned landfill received municipal and industrial waste between 1932 and 1971.

The site consists of a 120-acre landfill that is bisected into three distinct areas by Aero Drive and a wetland area (Areas A, B, and C). Areas B and C received municipal and industrial waste between 1932 and 1971. The industrial wastes were reportedly from steel and metal manufacturers, chemical and petroleum companies, utilities, manufacturers of optical and furnace-related materials and other large manufacturing and processing businesses. Area A was a soil borrow area.

The landfill was operated, in general, as a cut-and-fill operation where waste and drums, which were filled with substances that could be spilled out, were deposited into shallow 150-foot diameter pits and covered over with fly ash and fill material.  
  
The Erie County Health Department, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), EPA and the owner of the site property conducted various investigations at the site beginning in 1980. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1994. After the cleanup of the site, EPA took it off of the NPL in 2008.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed in two stages: an interim remedial measure (IRM) and a long-term remedial action phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.

Interim Remedial Measure: The removal of 4,534 on-site drums in 1995.

Long-term Cleanup: The Erie County Health Department, NYSDEC, EPA, and the owner of the site property conducted various investigations at the site beginning in 1980.

Following a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the nature and extent of the contamination and to identify and evaluate remedial alternatives, a remedy was selected in a February 1992 Record of Decision (ROD). The selected remedy included the construction of a cap and containment system and a leachate collection and treatment system. The ROD also called for the removal of the on-site drums, noted above as an IRM.

A second ROD, issued in January 1994, selected “no action” for Area A. It was determined that Area A was not used for the disposal of hazardous substances and significant levels of groundwater contamination were not detected.

To facilitate future development along Pfohl Road and Aero Drive, approximately 36 acres of the landfilled areas, consisting of about 540,000 cubic yards of waste located along these roads (the edges of Areas B and C) were excavated and consolidated on the interior portions of Areas B and C. In addition, 9,200 cubic yards of contaminated soil and waste were excavated to protect the wetlands and consolidated on the interior portions of Areas B and C. The consolidated wastes were capped and a containment system and leachate collection and treatment system were constructed. This work was completed in 2002.

Institutional controls are in place to further prevent potential exposures to the public, including trespassers.

Because EPA determined that all appropriate remedial actions were completed at the site, the cleanup goals were attained and no further actions, other than operation and maintenance and five-year reviews, are required, EPA deleted the site from the NPL in September 2008.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site continues to be monitored and regularly maintained.

Five-year reviews are undertaken at sites to ensure that implemented remedies protect public health and the environment and that they function as intended by site decision documents. Five-year reviews for this site were completed in March 2006, March 2011, June 2016 and November 2020. The five-year reviews concluded that the capping of the landfilled areas has removed potential direct contact ( *i.e.,* ingestion or dermal contact of soil) exposures to the public. The five-year reviews concluded that the site is protective of human health and the environment and functioning as designed. It is anticipated that the next five-year review will be completed by November 2025.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The 1992 ROD required the implementation of institutional controls to protect the integrity of the containment remedy and to prevent the use of contaminated groundwater. Restrictions in the form of Declarations of Covenants and Restrictions and Grant of Access were obtained from all seven owners of the lots affected by the Pfohl Brothers Landfill to protect the remedy. Five of the agreements were signed in 2003 and two were signed in 2005. These agreements prohibit the use of groundwater, excavation activities that would affect the integrity of the cap, and activities that would alter surface water drainage. In uncapped areas that can be redeveloped, these agreements prohibit basements and require active or passive soil gas controls, surface water systems to convey water to existing systems and paved parking areas. These institutional controls are still in effect.
