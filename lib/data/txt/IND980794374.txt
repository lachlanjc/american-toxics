### Background

The Wedzeb Enterprises, Inc. site covers three-quarters of an acre in Lebanon, Indiana. Wedzeb bought used electrical equipment, including capacitors and transformers containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), for resale and stored it in two warehouses. A fire completely destroyed one of the warehouses in 1981. Some electrical capacitors exploded in the fire. Water used to put out the fire mixed with contaminants from the capacitors and subsequently dripped onto the ground and flowed into a sanitary sewer line. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1991.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal and state actions.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s final remedy included cleaning sewer lines with hydraulic jets and vacuum pumping to remove contaminants, inspection of the sewer pipe, disposal or incineration of contaminated sediment, filtering sewer sediments and discharging clean water to the publicly owned treatment works, and removal and disposal of on-site wastes. Construction of the remedy finished in late 1990.

Earlier cleanup actions included fencing and a windbreak around the site in 1985 to minimize migration of dust off site. EPA removed contaminated on-site surface soils and debris from the area surrounding the warehouse on the eastern part of the site in 1987. The contaminated soil was replaced with clean fill. More than 250 drums and a three-pound capacitor were shipped off site for incineration.

Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1991.
