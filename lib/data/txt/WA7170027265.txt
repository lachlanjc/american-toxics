### Background

The Bangor Ordnance Disposal site is a 12-acre site located on the Bangor Naval Submarine Base in Silverdale, Washington. The Burn Area, which at 6 acres is the largest individual area of the site, was used to detonate and incinerate various ordnance materials. Waste material resulting from the Burn Area operations was deposited at the two adjacent Debris Areas. Surface water and shallow ground water were contaminated as a result of these activities. In 1983, the Navy moved to control the migration of potential chemical waste from the burn site by diverting stormwater runoff away from this area. Cattail Lake covers approximately four acres and is located about 500 feet from the site. Approximately 3,900 people reside within three miles of the base and depend on ground water for drinking water. An agricultural and residential area surrounds the facility. In 1990, another portion of this facility, the Bangor Naval Submarine Base site, was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) as a separate site. This site is being addressed through federal actions. The Navy is the lead agency for the cleanup at Bangor. EPA Region 10 is the lead regulatory agency.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.

Naval activities began at Bangor Ordnance Disposal in June 1944, when the U.S. Naval Magazine, Bangor was established. From 1944 to the early 1970s, the Navy used the Bangor facility primarily as a transshipment and storage point for ordnance. Ordnance arrived by train and by ship to support U.S. military efforts. In February 1977, the base was commissioned as the West Coast home port for the Trident Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile System. In 1978, the Navy Assessment and Control of Installation Pollutants (NACIP) program was initiated to evaluate waste disposal areas at the site. In 1990, another portion of this facility, the Bangor Naval Submarine Base site, was added to the NPL as a separate site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The siteâ€™s long-term remedy included soil flushing and treatment of the leachate using granular activated carbon, and groundwater extraction of treatment. Remedy construction took place between 1993 and 1999. Groundwater treatment and monitoring are ongoing.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Routine monitoring data is collected as part of the evaluation of the operation of the groundwater treatment system.
