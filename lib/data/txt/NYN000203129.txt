Background
The Brillo Landfill site is located along Route 370 in Victory, Cayuga County, New York. Industrial and sanitary wastes were dumped at the site from the 1960s to the 1980s. The operators of the landfill received a variety of other waste including wastewater treatment plant sludge and paint sludge from a nearby automotive electroplating facility. The site owner and operators transported, stored, and disposed of waste-filled drums containing sludge and chlorinated solvents. Brillo Landfill also received waste polishing compounds, sewage sludge, and waste grain from commercial food production during the 1980s. The adjacent wetland is contaminated with p﻿olychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), inorganic compounds, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The wetland is connected with Little Sodus Creek, which runs through additional wetlands that are affected by releases from the site. New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) groundwater sampling results from 2016, 2017, and 2019 show concentrations of site-related hazardous substances (i.e., VOCs, PCBs, and PFAS) in facility monitoring wells at levels above background. While sampling of private drinking water wells by NYSDEC in 2018 did not show any contamination, potential impacts in the future are possible.﻿ The nearest of these drinking water wells is approximately 0.2 mile southeast of site waste sources.
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Soil and sediment contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), PCBs, metals, and PFAS requires cleanup to protect human health and the environment. EPA has determined that placing the site on the NPL is the most effective approach for cleanup. New York has sent EPA a letter of support for placing the site on the NPL.
What Is the Current Site Status?
The site was proposed on the National Priorities List (NPL) on March 17, 2022.

Emergency Response and Removal
In response to a NYSDEC request for assistance, EPA removed approximately 2,018 drums from the site between June 2018 through April 2019. The drums were recovered, overpacked, hazardous substances removed, and the drums crushed. The total amount of waste managed and shipped off-site included 7,944 gallons of liquid waste, 782 tons of impacted soil, 520 yd3 of debris (drum carcasses, etc.), and 14 tons of other solids.
