### Background

The Wheeling Disposal superfund site is located in a rural area near the city of Amazonia, Andrew County, Missouri approximately six miles north from St. Joseph, Missouri and six miles southwest from Savannah, Missouri. The site property consists of two contiguous parcels of land covering approximately 200 acres and is bordered by rural residences, open pastures and heavily wooded areas. The contaminant source area is a ten-acre landfill centrally located within the site property. The perimeter of the landfill is marked off by barbed-wire fencing, locked gates and warning signs. The Site is not located in or near any known environmentally sensitive areas.

Wheeling Disposal Service Company, Inc. operated a sanitary and industrial landfill starting in the 1970s until it was closed in 1986. Site operations resulted in soil and groundwater contaminated with metals, organics and pesticides. Municipal waste was accepted in a sanitary landfill area in the central portion of the site property, and industrial waste was primarily disposed of in an area adjacent to the sanitary landfill. The primary industrial waste disposal area consisted of solid waste trenches, liquid waste trenches, evaporation ponds, a pesticide disposal trench, rinsed chemical trenches and a soil blending area. Prior to 1975, two sludge ponds were used to dispose of tannery waste. The sludge ponds were located approximately 1,000 feet northwest of the primary disposal area. Areas of the site property not used for waste disposal were farmed or remained in a native state.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Record of Decision for the selection of the remedy was signed on September 27, 1990. The ROD addressed the principal and secondary threats identified for the entire site. The selected remedy for the site included upgrading the existing landfill cover, long-term monitoring, maintenance activities, security measures and closing certain on-site wells.

The remedial action was initiated in January 1994. On-site construction activities included constructing of four separate caps over the former industrial disposal areas, the installing of ten groundwater monitoring wells to be used with six existing groundwater monitoring wells, regrading the cap to promote drainage and to prevent erosion, constructing a barbed-wire fence along the perimeter of the industrial disposal area and abandoning eleven groundwater monitoring wells. The EPA confirmed the completion of the construction activities in September 1994.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

**Five-Year Reviews**

The EPA conducts Five-Year Reviews to evaluate the protectiveness for remedial actions where hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants remain above levels that allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. The sixth and most recent FYR was completed on May 8, 2024. The EPA issued the following protectiveness statement for the entire site:

Protectiveness Statement: The remedy at the site is protective of human health and the environment.

The next FYR is due by May 8, 2029, five years from the completion of the previous FYR.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The ROD specified institutional controls to restrict land and groundwater use on the site property. An environmental covenant was recorded on the site property in February 2016 to fulfill the institutional control requirements.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Inspections are performed twice a year to assess the integrity of the landfill cap. Groundwater samples and surface water samples are collected biennially to monitor the contaminated groundwater plume.
