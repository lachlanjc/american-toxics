Background
The Morris Arsenic Dump site is located about one mile northeast of Morris, Minnesota. The site is the location of an old gravel pit that lies just south of the intersection of Minnesota State Highway 28 and U.S. Highway 59. In the early 1940s, Stevens County reportedly buried an estimated 1,500 pounds of surplus arsenic-based grasshopper pesticide (or “bait”) in the old gravel pit. Following investigations, EPA removed the site from the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1986.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Arsenic was the only potential contaminant of concern detected in site soil and groundwater. It is a carcinogen and also can cause non-cancerous illnesses or death. The levels of arsenic attributable to the site do not pose a health hazard to the public. It is common to find arsenic in the soil and groundwater in the glacial deposits in the western Minnesota area; the arsenic is derived from naturally occurring geologic sources as well as from the wide use of the grasshopper bait (pesticide) in the 1930s/1940s. The Minnesota Department of Health routinely recommends that any new drinking water wells in the western area of the state be sampled for arsenic and has published a fact sheet concerning this issue. It is available on the states Internet web-site.   NPL Deletions Superfund US EPA.
