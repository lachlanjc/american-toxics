### Background

The Hockessin Groundwater Site is located in the village of Hockessin in a mixed commercial and residential area. The site consists of a groundwater plume containing hazardous substances. There are two dry cleaners in the vicinity where historical and current operations appear to have contributed to the ground water contamination. There may be other sources of contamination within the area as well. The Artesian Water Company uses groundwater wells as the primary source of drinking water in this area. The State of Delaware began their investigation into potential sources when the water authority had reported contaminants in the untreated water in 2002. The site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List in May 2018, making it eligible for cleanup funding.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The municipal drinking water wells are continually monitored by the water authority and are blended and treated to ensure that the drinking water that is distributed to the residents meets the regulatory standards. The state installed and maintains carbon filtration systems on the three residential wells. In the fall of 2016, the EPA began a vapor intrusion assessment of shallow soils and residences above the ground water plume, and thus far, has seen a low impact to indoor air.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The State of Delaware referred the site to the EPA to assist in fully characterizing the extent and impact of the groundwater contamination. Other federal and state cleanup programs were evaluated, but were not viable due to the complexity of the site geology.

EPA proposed the Hockessin Groundwater Site to the National Priorities List (NPL) in January 2018, and it was [added to the NPL in May 2018 (PDF).](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-05-17/pdf/2018-10464.pdf)

Groundwater is the main source of drinking water in the Hockessin area. There are three municipal wells, three residential wells and one irrigation well that are contaminated above the drinking water maximum contaminant levels within the plume area. The Artesian Water Company serves approximately 184,000 people, of which, 10,500 could be directly affected by the contaminated wellfield. Artesian is treating the contaminated groundwater, and the final processed drinking water meets all federal and state regulatory standards.
