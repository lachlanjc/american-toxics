### Background

The Capitol Lakes were originally part of a natural drainage system called Grassie Bayou. Grassie Bayou was contiguous with the Mississippi River until the early 20th century, when it was dammed creating the lake system. Because there is no natural outlet, water which flows into the lake must be pumped out by a pumping station on the Mississippi River. This creates a stagnant lake system and causes retention of sediment and contaminants. Contamination of the lake system was first found in 1972 with the detection of oil contaminated with pesticides and PCBs. In 1983, when the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) investigated a report of PCB-laden oil entering the lake, a fish advisory was established due to PCBs and various metals which remains in place today.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

There have been no cleanup activities involving the contaminated sediments of the lake system to date.
