Background
The Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (IAAAP) is a government-owned, contractor-operated (American Ordnance) ammunitions production (load, assembly and pack) facility in southeastern Iowa, approximately four miles west of Burlington. IAAAP encompasses approximately 19,000 acres, including active and inactive production and storage areas, undeveloped areas and agricultural leases. IAAAP, originally known as Iowa Ordnance Plant, was constructed in November 1940 and began production in 1941. The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) operated at portions of IAAAP from 1947 to 1975. Historical operations, by both the Army and the AEC, resulted in releases of hazardous substances to soil, surface water and groundwater at IAAAP. The site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1990. The primary contaminants of concern include explosives, metals, volatile organic compounds and depleted uranium (DU).
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Remedial activities at IAAAP are being conducted under eleven Operable Units (OUs): OU1 (soils), OU3 (off-post groundwater), OU4 (inert disposal area), OU5 (Military Munitions Response Program), OU6 (on-post groundwater), OU7 (miscellaneous sites), OU8 (Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program [FUSRAP]), OU9 (construction debris sites), OU10 (Explosive Disposal Areas ), OU11 (No Further Action Areas) and OU12 (Compliance Related Cleanup areas).  Remedial Actions have been, or are being implemented at all of the eleven OUs . Remediation at OU1 has included excavation and treatment of contaminated soils. After treatment, soils were either taken to the on-site landfill (Inert Disposal Area) or taken to an off-site disposal facility. Remediation at OU3 has included connecting affected residents to an alternative water supply and in situ treatment and monitoring of the groundwater plume. Remediation at OU4 has included capping and monitoring of contaminated soils. Remediation at OU5 has consisted primarily of implementing land use controls.  Remediation at OU8 has included excavating, treating and off-site disposal of contaminated soils. In addition, contaminated buildings have been either decontaminated or removed for off-site disposal. 
What Is the Current Site Status?
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers performed a base-wide Remedial Investigation to better define the extent of contamination in order to move forward with remediation of OU6, OU7, and OU9. The Remedial Investigations may resulted in the creation of three new OUs: OU10 for a portion of on-post groundwater, OU11 for areas requiring no further action and OU12 for areas previous managed under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act permit. 
In addition, the USACE is continuing the remedial action (soil excavation, treatment and off-site disposal) at the Firing Sites Area (OU8). 

Sampling and Monitoring
The Army performs periodic sampling as part of the ongoing remedial actions at OU3 and OU4. In addition, the Army completed sampling for base-wide Remedial Investigations in June 2020. The Remedial Investigation Reports are currently under regulatory review.
