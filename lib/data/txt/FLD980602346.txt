### Background

The Varsol Spill site is located in Miami, Florida. It includes an area of the Miami International Airport where fuel spills occurred starting in 1966. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983 because of contaminated groundwater and surface water resulting from these spills. EPA, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and Eastern Airlines, the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP), have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination.

- In 1985, following site investigations and analyses, the EPA determined there was no need for further cleanup action because contamination no longer existed in groundwater.
- EPA took the site off the NPL in 1988.
- By cleaning up the site, EPA, FDEP and the site’s PRP have protected people and the environment from site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site includes the northeast section of Miami International Airport in Miami, Florida, less than a half-mile mile south of the Lower Miami Springs Municipal Well Field. Residential and commercial land uses border the Miami International Airport and the site. The site includes the area where, starting in 1966, approximately 15 spills and leaks from airport-related industrial operations released approximately two million gallons of fuel and other materials.

- Eastern Airlines, the site’s PRP, led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA.
- EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983 because of contaminated ground water and surface water resulting from these spills.
- In 1971, the PRP installed separator trenches to remove about two million gallons of fuel and other materials that had spilled underground. The PRP ended recovery operations in 1973 due to the slow migration of contamination into the trenches. The PRP recovered about 133,000 gallons of Varsol, a petroleum substance used to dissolve other substances, between 1971 and 1973.
- In 1983, Miami-Dade County installed 43 groundwater monitoring wells to determine the extent and magnitude of the spills at the site. Miami-Dade County also installed three recovery wells in the Concourse E area and began groundwater recovery operations. Between 1983 and 1984, operations recovered over 102,000 gallons of jet fuel.
- In 1985, following site investigations and analyses, EPA determined there was no need for further cleanup action because contamination no longer existed in groundwater. EPA took the site off the NPL in 1988.
- EPA considers this site and two other Superfund sites, the Miami Drum Services site and the Northwest 58th Street Landfill site, as one management unit for site investigation and cleanup activities. The sites lie over the Biscayne Aquifer, which is the sole source of drinking water in southeastern Florida.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1985, EPA issued the [Record of Decision (ROD)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/10802037) cleanup plan for the Site. The ROD recommended that no further action was necessary at the Site because investigations could not locate remaining contamination from the fuel spills.

EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 1988 and does not require Five Year Reviews for the site. EPA anticipates no further remedial actions will be required for this Site.

### Enforcement Information

EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site PRP to investigate the site. The PRP funded site investigation and cleanup activities.
