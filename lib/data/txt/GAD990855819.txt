### Background

The 1-acre Luminous Processes, Inc. site is located west of Athens, Georgia. It includes the area where an industrial facility manufactured luminous watch and clock dials from 1952 to 1978. EPA proposed the site to the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1981 because of contaminated soil resulting from facility operations. EPA and the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (Georgia EPD) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. By cleaning up the site, EPA and Georgia EPD continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is located on U.S. Highway 78/29 in Clarke County, Georgia, four miles west of Athens. Site surroundings include commercial and residential land uses. Commercial businesses border the site. The site includes the area where Luminous Processes, Inc. operated a manufacturing facility from 1952 to 1978. Manufacturing operations used radioactive material in the production of luminous watch and clock dials. The company abandoned the site in 1980. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and the Georgia Department of Health (now the Department of Human Resources) licensed the site. Due to financial problems, the owners never completed decontamination activities when the plant closed.

In 1981, EPA proposed the site for listing on the NPL. Georgia EPD led site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with EPA.

In 1982, Georgia EPD began cleanup activities to address contaminated areas inside the former manufacturing facility and from the outdoor area around the facility. Georgia EPD dug up contaminated soil, removed more than 2,400 drums of chemicals and disposed the soil and drums at an off-site facility. Georgia EPD also filled in dug-up areas with clean soil, seeded the areas and restricted public access with fencing and warning signs. Georgia EPD completed cleanup activities in a five-month period. After EPA determined that Georgia EPD had conducted all necessary cleanup actions, EPA removed the site’s proposed NPL listing in 1982. EPA also determined that the site does not require Five-Year Reviews.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1982, Georgia EPD conducted early cleanup actions. Cleanup actions addressed site contamination and EPA did not require a long-term site cleanup plan.  

After cleanup, EPA removed the site’s proposed NPL listing in 1982.
