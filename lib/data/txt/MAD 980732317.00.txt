### Background

The Groveland Wells site is located in Groveland, Massachusetts. The site includes the watershed and aquifer supplying two municipal drinking water wells, as well as three properties that were polluting groundwater and soil in the area. The Groveland production Wells #1 and #2, the sole source of drinking water for the town, was shut down in 1979 when the state detected trichloroethylene (TCE) above acceptable limits.

The main source of contamination was from the former Valley Manufacturing Products Company at 64 Washington Street where metal parts, screws, and cable connectors had been made from1963 until 2001 when it closed. Liquid wastes from the manufacturing process were disposed of in buried leach fields. There was also a major leak from an underground storage tank containing TCE. The company routinely dumped hazardous materials on the surface of the ground, which eventually leached down to the groundwater. Hazardous substances released included cutting oils, mineral spirits, TCE, VOCs, and acid bath wastes. Groveland production Wells #1 and #2, the sole source of drinking water for the town, were shut down in 1979 when the state detected TCE contamination above drinking water's maximum contaminant limits. The town instituted emergency conservation measures and temporarily obtained water hookups from neighboring communities. Town Well # 2 was permanently abandoned due to its proximity to the Merrimack River and the Haverhill Landfill. Groveland Town Well #1 is now safe and operational. Groveland developed Well #3 in a different aquifer in the early 1980s.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1999, EPA funded and oversaw the construction of the Groundwater Treatment Facility (GWTF). The system began operat­ing in April of 2000. The GWTF was built on the Archdiocese of Boston property located at 62 Washington Street, behind the Valley building. EPA operated and maintained the groundwater treatment system from 2000-2011. During this time, the system removed more than 1,130 pounds of total VOCs and pumped and treated more than 4 million gallons of contaminated ground­water. After nearly 10 years of treatment, the groundwater and soil contamination levels remained high in the source area. To address this contamination, EPA funded and oversaw the construction and operation of a thermally-enhanced soil vapor extrac­tion system, known as Electrical Resistive Heating (ERH), which operated from August 2010 through February 2011, removing more than 1,300 pounds of VOCs, 18 gallons of Non-aqueous Phase Liquids, 311 million cubic feet of vapors and over 2 million gallons of groundwater and contaminated condensate.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA conducted an optimization study for the Site in 2012 and developed an exit strategy in 2013 to complete cleanup actions. The optimization and exit strategy concluded that active groundwater extraction and treatment activities could cease because the Electrical Resistive Heating (ERH) cleanup removed the mass of residual TCE contamination in the source area soil. Therefore it was appropriate to transition from active treatment to monitored natural attenuation, which includes more frequent and extensive groundwater monitoring. In January 2020, MassDEP auctioned off the groundwater treatment equipment and is hiring a contractor to decommission the plant.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**  
  
This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict the use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used appropriate and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The matrix below is a general summary of the restrictions at this site at the date of this report. The information in this matrix is a general description of the restrictions at the site only. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.  
  
The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment, and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above. Note that where multiple entries occur, it will impact more than one pathway.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits, and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left on site and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remain onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.

In addition to the areas addressed by the institutional controls identified on this website, there may be other areas on the property that require restrictions on the use of the property that are not captured in this EPA database.

### Sampling and Monitoring

MassDEP, under EPA oversight, continues to sample groundwater for VOCs on an annual basis.

EPA will complete the fourth [Five Year Review](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0100750&doc=Y&colid=32806&region=01&type=SC) of the cleanup actions at the Site, by June of 2020.
