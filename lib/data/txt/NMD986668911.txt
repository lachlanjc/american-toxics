### Background

The Fruit Avenue Plume site is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Between 1924 and 1972, laundering and dry cleaning activities took place at the site. Dry cleaning operations and waste disposal practices contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state and federal actions.

Between 1924 and 1958, a local business owner operated Sunshine Laundry at the site. In 1940, the owner expanded his laundry services to include a dry cleaning service. From 1940 until 1972, workers at Elite Cleaners, the new dry cleaning facility, used the Stoddard solvent cleaning process, which involved underground solvent tanks.

In April 1989, routine sampling at a nearby bottling company’s supply well found chlorinated solvents in the groundwater. Investigations have determined that historical dry cleaning processes were the cause of the site’s groundwater contamination.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included soil vapor extraction, hot spot treatment, institutional controls, extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater, and groundwater monitoring. Remedy construction took place between 2003 and 2006.

Recent groundwater monitoring results verified that contaminant concentrations are now below the site’s remedial goals. Therefore, the groundwater treatment system is currently in “standby” mode. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

An early cleanup action in 1989 by the City of Albuquerque removed two underground storage tanks and associated contaminated soil from the site.
