Background
The six-acre Alabama Plating Co. Inc. Superfund site is located in Vincent, Shelby County, Alabama. It includes an area where electroplating took place from 1956 to 1986. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2012 because of contaminated ground water resulting from facility operations. The EPA and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM)Exit conducted a remedial investigation/feasibility study that resulted in a 2014 Record of Decision identifying groundwater cleanup actions required to return the groundwater to beneficial use.  Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. A water line connects residences and businesses to the public water supply. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The EPA leads site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with ADEM.   1998 – 2000
The EPA conducted multiple time-critical short-term cleanups to remove contamination from soil and buildings at the site. The EPA fenced the area where contamination remains in subsurface sediments. 2014 – 2015
The EPA completed the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study and Record of Decision outlining remedial action for site ground water and sediment in September 2014.  The EPA completed the remedial design in September 2015.  2017 – 2018
The EPA and ADEM conducted groundwater injections of nutrients to speed up natural attenuation of contaminants in the groundwater from December 2017 to March 2018. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
The EPA completed the RI/FS and Record of Decision outlining remedial action for site ground water and sediment in September 2014.  The EPA completed the remedial design in September 2015.  The Remedial action groundwater injections.began in December 2017 and ended in March 2018. The first Five-Year review of the site was completed in 2023 and states that the remedy in place is protective of human health and the enviroment. The EPA will continue to conduct Five-Year reviews of the site until groundwater reaching cleanup goals. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
The EPA has put institutional controls on the site to restrict soil and groundwater against residentional use on the site to prevent exsposure to the contamination. Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
The first post groundwater injection sampling event was conducted on March 28, 2022 by ADEM.
