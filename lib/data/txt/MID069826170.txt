### Background

The 159-acre South Macomb Disposal Authority (SMDA) site is located in Macomb County, Michigan. The site includes two adjacent landfills that received municipal waste from 1968 through 1975. Reportedly, no hazardous wastes were disposed of in the landfills; however, hazardous chemicals are present at and around the site. Discharge leaking from the landfill entered the McBride Drain, an open channel that receives runoff from the site and flows to the North Branch of the Clinton River. Contamination has impacted subsurface soils as well as the groundwater in residential drinking water wells and three aquifers. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The long-term remedy at the site included leachate and groundwater collection and treatment, landfill gas venting, monitoring of the effectiveness of the cleanup, and deed restrictions and institutional controls. Construction finished in 2005. However, in 2006, cleanup results did not meet required performance standards. In response, the State of Michigan approved additional leachate collection and groundwater extraction methods to meet performance standards. Ongoing monitoring will help determine whether the additional remedial actions have helped the site achieve compliance or whether additional actions may be necessary. Operations and maintenance activities are ongoing.
