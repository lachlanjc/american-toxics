### Background

The 24-acre Motor Wheel, Inc. site is located in Lansing, Michigan. Motor Wheel Corporation used the area as a disposal site for industrial waste from 1938 until about 1971. Waste disposal operations contaminated waste material, soil, groundwater and sediment with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires maintaining site restrictions and ensuring that the groundwater extraction and treatment system is functioning as designed. Groundwater monitoring will continue until groundwater meets site cleanup standards.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included capping the waste disposal area, extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater, land use restrictions, and monitoring to assess the status of the remedy. Groundwater contamination and the infrastructure for the site’s groundwater extraction system extend about 1.5 miles south of the waste disposal area. Construction of the remedy took place between 1999 and 2012. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The primary contaminants of concern affecting the MWDS are **Volatile Organic Compounds**, including benzene, PCE, TCE, toluene, and xylenes; **organics**, including PAHs, PCBs, and pesticides; and **metals**, including arsenic, chromium, and lead.

### Sampling and Monitoring

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions between 1970 and 1982 disposed of contaminated waste off site and backfilled former pond areas.  

### Enforcement Information

There are curently no enforcement activities at the MWDS.
