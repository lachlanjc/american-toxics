### Background

The Donnelsville Contaminated Aquifer site is a contaminated groundwater plume located in the village of Donnelsville and portions of Bethel Township, Ohio. In 1990, tetrachloroethylene, or PCE, is a volatile organic compound that was first detected during routine sampling. In 2010, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency referred the site to the U.S. EPA for additional investigations. Additional sampling confirmed that groundwater contaminated with VOCs migrated into the local drinking water wells. The source of contamination is currently unknown.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In September 2018, U.S. EPA listed Donnelsville Contaminated Aquifer site on the National Priorities List. The NPL is the list of hazardous waste sites in the United States that are eligible for long-term remedial action and federal funding under the Superfund law. The Superfund law is what gives EPA the authority to clean up releases of hazardous substances.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will begin the remedial investigation, or RI, at the Donnelsville Contaminated Aquifer Superfund site. The RI is the phase of the Superfund cleanup process that helps U.S. EPA define the nature and extent of contamination at the site and to evaluate the human health and ecological risks posed by site contamination.

Once the RI is complete, U.S. EPA will evaluate cleanup options in a Feasibility Study. After evaluating the different cleanup options, U.S. EPA will publish a document called a Proposed Plan. The Proposed Plan will outline the cleanup alternatives considered for the site and identify the Agency’s recommended cleanup method. The Proposed Plan will be made available to the public, and the community will have 30 days to provide its comments. Once all public comments are received and addressed, U.S. EPA will select the final cleanup method in a Record of Decision.

### Emergency Response and Removal

In 2011, U.S. EPA's Removal Program installed approximately 25 air strippers or granulated activated carbon water treatment systems homes and at a community park well where the levels of VOC contaminants exceeded the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Maximum Contaminant Levels.
