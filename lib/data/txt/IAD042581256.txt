Background
The 15-acre Aidex Corporation site is located in rural Mineola, Iowa, about seven miles south-southwest of Council Bluffs. Aidex Corporation operated a pesticide formulation facility at the site from 1974 until 1980. The soil and groundwater at the site was contaminated with a variety of pesticide compounds. Spills of pesticides during transfer of the materials from tank cars to formulation equipment, and the improper handling, storage and disposal of process wastes, resulted in the release of pesticide compounds into the environment. Site operators also stored liquid process wastes in an underground storage tank that leaked. In 1976, a building used to formulate the herbicide atrazine and other pesticides was destroyed by a fire. The surrounding soil, aquifer and groundwater were contaminated with an herbicide and pesticides by water used to extinguish the blaze﻿. A shallow aquifer that underlies the site was contaminated, and 42 shallow domestic water wells were located within a two-mile radius of the site. In 1981, the EPA began a fund-lead cleanup at the site. Approximately 3,400 drums of pesticides were stored in open areas on the site, a concrete pit in the destroyed building contained about two feet of contaminated water, and a large underground storage tank also held contaminated materials. The site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site was addressed through federal and state actions. The Remedial Action selected by the EPA to address the threat posed by the pesticide contamination in the soil and groundwater was documented in a Record of Decision issued in September 1984. The Remedial Action included excavating and off-site disposal of 20,608 cubic yards of contaminated soils and buried wastes; grading, when necessary and seeding the remaining soils; draining and decontamination of a buried tank and waste pit; construction of a drainage ditch around the site to prevent excessive water from entering the site; expanding the monitoring well network by adding three wells to monitor mid-range and deep water quality downgradient of the site; vacuuming the buildings to remove loose dust from all accessible interior surfaces and washing floors and walls; and test monitoring wells annually for 30 years or until a determination is made that the site no longer poses a threat to nearby drinking water supplies.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The EPA deleted the site from the NPL in October 21, 1993. The third and final Five-Year Review of the protectiveness of the site’s remedy was completed in January 30, 2004. No further cleanup is necessary.  Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
No land use restrictions are necessary. The site is currently being reused.
