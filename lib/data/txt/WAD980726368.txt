### Background

The Commencement Bay/Near Shore/Tideflats (CB/NT) Superfund site is located in the Cites of Tacoma and Ruston at the southern end of Puget Sound in Washington. The site encompasses an active commercial seaport and includes 12 square miles of shallow water, shoreline, and adjacent land - most of which is highly developed and industrialized.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund National Priorities List in 1983 due to widespread contamination of the water, sediments, and upland areas. EPA has divided the site into several "operable units" (OUs) that are being managed as distinct cleanup sites:

- Commencement Bay Sediments (OU 01)
- Asarco Tacoma Smelter Facility (OU 02)
- Tacoma Tar Pits (OU 03)
- Asarco Off-property (Ruston/Tacoma Yards Study Area – OU 04)
- Source Control (OU 05)
- Asarco Groundwater and Sediment (OU 06)
- Asarco Demolition (OU 07)

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state, federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

**Commencement Bay Sediment (OU 01)**

Eight problem areas were the focus of the sediment cleanup:

- Head of Hylebos Waterway
- Mouth of Hylebos Waterway
- Sitcum Waterway
- St. Paul Waterway
- Middle Waterway
- Head of Thea Foss Waterway
- Mouth of Thea Foss Waterway
- Wheeler-Osgood Waterway

No action was required to be taken in the Blair Waterway other than those actions identified in the Puyallup Land Settlement Agreement. In 1996, EPA deleted the Blair Waterway (including properties associated with the Blair Waterway transferred to the Tribe in the Puyallup Land Settlement Agreement) from the National Priorities List (NPL) because cleanups had been completed in these areas, or studies had been completed showing that this waterway did not require cleanup.

**Head of Hylebos Waterway**

The PRPs cleaned up this area of the Site between 2004 and 2006, with additional response actions in 2009. Approximately 42 acres of sediment were dredged, several shoreline areas were excavated, and all material was disposed in an off-site landfill. A cap was installed at the former Arkema facility in 2009. Since 2012, the PRPs have been monitoring this area of the Site for natural recovery and to ensure that it does not have recontamination from upland sources.

**Mouth of Hylebos Waterway**

The PRPs cleaned up this area of the Site between 2003 and 2005. Approximately 190,000 cubic yards uncontaminated sediment was removed and transported to the Commencement Bay open-water disposal site, while another 450,000 cubic yards contaminated sediment was dredged and placed in the Blair Slip 1 Nearshore Confined Disposal Facility. Capping under Piers 24 and 25 was completed in 2008. Since 2018, the PRPs have been monitoring this area of the Site for natural recovery and to ensure that the cap continues to contain the contaminated sediment and this area does not have recontamination from upland sources.

Investigations and source control actions at the Occidental problem area are ongoing under an Ecology MTCA order. Five years following an order implementing a final MTCA Corrective Action Plan, Occidental will submit an Occidental Site Cleanup Status Report (“Status Report”) that summarizes the status of activities conducted at the Occidental property, evaluates whether those activities have sufficiently controlled releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants from the Occidental property contaminated soil, groundwater, and surface water to Site sediments, and recommends whether additional response actions are necessary to evaluate and/or address Occidental Site sediment contamination. Upon review of this report, EPA will determine the final sediment cleanup for this area of the Site

**Sitcum Waterway**

In September 1988, the PRPs completed source control activities and implemented a sediment cleanup action in the St. Paul Waterway \[NT1\] with oversight of the Washington Department of Ecology. The sediment action consisted of placing a clean layer of sediment over contaminated sediment. A portion of the capped area was converted to uplands and covered with an asphalt cap, and the remaining area was restored to intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats. Additionally, the wastewater outfall was relocated offshore of the capped area and additional controls were placed on the discharge with a Washington State Industrial Wastewater discharge permit.

**St. Paul Waterway**

In 1994, the PRPs dredged 396,000 cubic yards of bottom sediments and placed them in the Milwaukee Nearshore Confined Disposal Facility. A 4.5-acre area beneath Pier 7 was evaluated for Monitored Natural Recovery in the surface sediment; however, subsurface sediment contamination remains under the clean cover. As part of remediation of the St. Paul Waterway portion of the site, PRPs restored 11 acres of shallow marine habitat for ecological reuse. In 1996, EPA deleted the St. Paul Waterway from the National Priorities List (NPL) because the cleanup was completed in this area.

**Middle Waterway**

The PRPs conducted cleanup activities between 2003 and 2004. Approximately 109,500 cubic yards of dredged sediments from the Middle Waterway were placed in the Blair Slip 1 Nearshore Confined Disposal Facility. An additional 3,125 cubic yards of contaminated sediment was excavated and disposed in an off-site landfill. This area was subsequently backfilled and developed as habitat restoration. Additional areas were capped or selected for Monitored Natural Recovery or Enhanced Natural Recovery. Aquatic habitat was constructed in the shoreline.

Since 2004, the PRPs have been monitoring this area of the Site for natural or enhanced recovery and to ensure that it does not have recontamination from upland sources. An additional response action to place ENR material and shoreline stabilization was conducted in 2013 to address mercury contamination. In 2018, the surface sediment in Middle Waterway had recovered, and the Remedial Action was deemed completed. However, long-term monitoring and maintenance of capped areas and constructed habitat areas will continue.

**Head of Thea Foss Waterway**

The PRPs installed an 8.8-acre cap between 2003 and 2004. Since 2004, the PRPs have been monitoring this area of the Site to ensure that the cap continues to contain the contaminated sediment and that it does not have recontamination from upland sources. In 2008, the Remedial Action in this area of the Site was deemed complete; however, long-term monitoring and maintenance of capped and constructed habitat areas will continue.

**Mouth of Thea Foss Waterway**

The PRPs conducted cleanup activities between summer 2003 and spring 2006. This work consisted of constructing the 11-acre St. Paul Waterway Confined Disposal Facility (CDF), dredging 425,674 cubic yards of contaminated sediment with disposal in the St. Paul CDF, capping of 24 acres, four acres of Enhanced Natural Recovery, and 21 acres were designated for Monitored Natural Recovery. As part of remediation of the Mouth of Thea Foss Waterway portion of the site, PRPs restored 70 acres of shallow marine habitat for ecological reuse.

Since 2006, the PRPs have been monitoring this area of the Site for natural or enhanced recovery and to ensure that it does not have recontamination from upland sources. In 2020, this area of the site had recovered, and the Remedial Action was deemed completed. However, long-term monitoring and maintenance of capped areas, constructed habitat areas, and the St. Paul CDF will continue.

**Wheeler-Osgood Waterway**

The PRPs cleaned up this area of the Site with the Mouth of Thea Foss Waterway.

**Asarco Tacoma Smelter Facility (OU 02)**

Asarco conducted cleanup of the former Tacoma Smelter Facility from 1996 through 2005. Asarco completed the following remedial actions prior to filing for bankruptcy in August 2005:

- Demolition of the remaining buildings and structures;
- Construction and closure of the RCRA Subtitle C OCF;
- Removal of source area soils and disposal in the OCF;
- Construction of a portion of the shoreline armoring along the frontage of the smelter property and the outer edge of the breakwater peninsula;
- Construction of the habitat basin as mitigation for the shoreline armoring;
- Remediation of the Stack Hill property to residential standards.

Asarco sold its property in December 2005 through bankruptcy to MC Construction (a developer who later assigned rights to Point Ruston, LLC). Point Ruston LLC is cleaning up the former smelter property as part of a large housing and commercial development, under EPA’s continued oversight. The settlement with Point Ruston called for a cap on the former smelter property and 17 acres of the breakwater peninsula, and allowed for site buildings and hardscapes to be integrated as part of the site cap if EPA approved controls and construction methods.

Integration of remediation and development required the site to be remediated in four phases:

- Construction Phase I remediation was completed in 2015, which included remedial action of Master Infrastructure, Phase I construction, Waterwalk cap, Shoreline Armoring, and 17-acre cap on the breakwater peninsula. Construction of the remaining 6 acres of the upland cap and the remaining shoreline cap on the breakwater peninsula was completed by Metro Parks Tacoma in 2019.
- Remediation of several areas of Phases II was completed; however, construction is ongoing and scheduled to be complete by June 2021.
- Construction Phase III remediation was completed in June 2020.
- Remediation of several areas of Phases IV was completed.
The cap on the entire site will be completed by June 2022. However, development will continue into the future so the cleanup action here will not be complete until the development is complete.

**Tacoma Tar Pits (OU 03)**

The PRPs excavated 185,170 cubic yards of non-tarry soil, tarry material, and auto fluff and stabilized with Portland cement in an engineered waste pile. The engineered waste pile was covered with an engineered cap. Asphalt and concrete paving were placed to cover the surfaces of the metals recycling facility.

A storm water drainage system was installed by the PRPs that consists of both the waste pile drainage system and the metals facility drainage system. Box culverts or catch basins collect surface water and direct drainage to detention basins. Both detention basins drain into the BNSF\[NT1\] ditch through restricting orifices, then to the Cleveland Way pumping station, and ultimately on to the Puyallup River. There is a Washington State Industrial Stormwater Discharge permit for the surface water discharge from Detention Basin No. 2 on site.

The PRPs installed a groundwater extraction and treatment system in 2002 to prevent contaminated groundwater from migrating off site and potentially impacting the Puyallup River. The system consisted of the treatment plant, four extraction wells (two in each of the two benzene plumes), and ancillary piping. The groundwater treatment plant utilizes air stripping to eliminate benzene from groundwater and uses granular activated carbon to sorb volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the vapor stream.

Treated groundwater effluent is discharged to the City of Tacoma publicly owned treatment works (POTW) under a discharge permit. The system was operating full time by September 2002 and underwent optimization in 2017. Cleanup levels have been achieved in all aquifers for metals, [cPAHs](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=PAH) (causes of cancer) and [PCBs](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=PCB). Benzene in one aquifer (Sand Aquifer) along two portions of the site boundary is being addressed with an optimized pump and treatment system.

EPA continues to work with the PRPs to monitor the remedy and may conduct an optimization study in the next couple of years.

**Asarco Off-property (Ruston/Tacoma Yards Study Area – OU 04)**

From 1993 to 2011 properties in the North Tacoma/Ruston area were tested by EPA for arsenic and lead contamination from the Asarco smelter. You can search for sampling results and cleanup records for properties in the EPA Ruston and North Tacoma Study Area on the Washington State Department of Ecology's website. It will take you to the Area-wide Remediation Environmental Information System (AREIS) Database, which is a joint project with Washington Department of Ecology and EPA, with help from the Tacoma Pierce County Health Department. Information on additional cleanup by the Washington Department of Ecology will be added to this database as the work is completed.

EPA sampled 3,570 properties and cleaned up 2,436 with the worst contamination, within a one square mile area of Ruston and north Tacoma centered around the former smelter. Since 2013, the Washington Department of Ecology has been conducting voluntary yard cleanups within a larger study area. Nearly all the yards in the EPA Study Area have been cleaned up to EPA’s cleanup goals. However, Ecology has lower cleanup goals and is revisiting some of these properties for additional cleanup. EPA and Ecology are coordinating efforts to complete the cleanup. Learn more about the [Department of Ecology](https://ecology.wa.gov/Spills-Cleanup/Contamination-cleanup/Cleanup-sites/Tacoma-smelter/Yard-cleanup-program#:~:text=The%20Yard%20Program%20includes%20the,property%20at%20the%20initial%20visit.) and the [Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department’s work](https://www.tpchd.org/healthy-homes/dirt-alert-tacoma-smelter-plume) to clean up properties:

**Tacoma Smelter Plume**

In 2009, the site received about $5.2 million in American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) funds. These funds supported activities at the Ruston/North Tacoma study area. These resources helped complete residential, parkland and right-of-way cleanups.

**Source Control (OU 05)**

The 1989 Record of Decision for Commencement Bay Sediment (OU 01) and Sources of contamination (OU 5) required that the major sources of contamination to the waterways were controlled prior to active remediation in the waterways to ensure that the sediment cleanup will achieve respective sediment goals.

In 1992, EPA released the Source Control Strategy Report that describes the methods that are currently being used to identify and control contaminant sources at the COMMENCEMENT BAY site. The following five milestones were developed for tracking and reporting source control efforts for each problem area:

- Milestone 1—Ongoing Confirmed Sources Identified: all confirmed ongoing sources of problem chemicals are identified for a problem area.
- Milestone 2—Essential Administrative Actions in Place for Major Sources: essential administrative actions (permits, orders, decrees) are in place for major sources of problem chemicals in each problem area.
- Milestone 3—Essential Remedial Action Implemented for Major Sources: essential remedial actions (construction, BMPs, soil removal) have been implemented for all major sources in a problem area. Essential remedial actions are those physical changes that represent elimination and/or reduction, to the extent practicable, of those contaminant sources that are most directly linked to existing sediment impacts.
- Milestone 4—Administrative Actions in Place for All Sources: administrative actions are in place for all confirmed ongoing sources of problem chemicals to a problem area.
- Milestone 5—Remedial Action Implemented for All Sources: remedial actions have been implemented for all ongoing sources of problem chemicals to a problem area.

Ecology provided reports to EPA when each milestone for source control was achieved.

**St. Paul and Blair Waterways**

Milestone Reports were not required to be conducted for these Waterways. Sources that drained only to them were deleted from the NPL in 1996 because cleanups had either been completed in these areas or studies had indicated that no contamination requiring cleanup was present.

**Sitcum Waterway**

Milestone Reports 1 through 5 were completed by Ecology and all sources in the Sitcum Waterway were controlled by 1994, and all RA construction activities were completed by 1998. In 2017, the Sitcum Waterway and sources draining only to it, were deleted from the NPL.

**Thea Foss Waterway and Wheeler-Osgood Waterway**

Milestone Reports 1 through 5 were completed by Ecology and EPA was notified that source control is complete for all identified chemical sources to the Mouth of the Thea Foss Waterway in 1999, the Wheeler-Osgood Waterway (2000), and the Head of the Thea Foss Waterway (2003).

Ecology continues to conduct periodic reviews of D Street Petroleum and American Plating; D Street Petroleum continues to monitor groundwater contamination. They also are currently overseeing cleanup actions at Standard Chemical, Tacoma Coal Gas site, and Nustar/Superior Oil.

Ecology took an additional action in 1997 at 1114 Dock Street to remove contaminated embankment fill and disposed at an upland landfill. Residual contamination was capped. Ecology continues to conduct periodic reviews of this cleanup action.

**Hylebos Waterway**

Milestone Reports 1 through 5 were completed by Ecology and EPA was notified that source control is complete for all identified sources of problem chemicals to the Mouth of the Hylebos Waterway and the Head of the Hylebos Waterway in 2000. Groundwater monitoring is being conducted at 3009 Taylor Way Log Sorting (Atofina) and B&L Landfill to determine whether they meet performance standards. Long-term groundwater monitoring will be at Kaiser Aluminum, General Metals, Wasser Winters Log Sorting Yards, Louisiana Pacific Log Sorting Yards, and Tacoma Boat, and Ecology conducts periodic reviews of these sites.

Source control is not complete at the former Arkema site. Arsenic is leaching to groundwater and discharging to the waterway. Ecology entered into a MTCA Agreed Order with the Port of Tacoma in 2011 to replace the pre-MTCA enforcement order with Arkema, and effectively released Arkema from state liability. Ecology is working with the Port to develop a feasibility study for the upland source area.

Sediment samples were collected from the edge of the General Metals cap in early 2009. Zinc was detected as concentrations greater than the cleanup goal; further sampling is planned to determine the reason for these detections.

Cleanup of the Occidental Site’s upland portion is being conducted under an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) amended in 2005 to specifically include CERCLA and RCRA cleanup provisions. This amended AOC includes the remaining portions of the non-time critical removal actions (Area 5106 and Embankment Area), and it also serves as the substance of an updated Ecology RCRA corrective action permit. Ecology is currently working with Occidental to finalize a MTCA Corrective Action Order to implement a groundwater and soil/vapor monitoring plan as well as a draft Cleanup Action Plan for the contaminated groundwater.

Ecology has discovered that arsenic-contaminated groundwater is leaking into storm drains and discharges at Lincoln Avenue into Hylebos. The sources of this contamination include USG, Arkema, and Superlon. Ecology is currently working clean up these sites.

**Middle Waterway**

Ecology identified Marine Industries Northwest, Inc. (MINI) as the only major contaminant source to the Middle Waterway at the mouth of the waterway. Milestone Reports 1 through 5 were completed by Ecology and a Source Control Completion Report was issued in December 2000 documenting that all Milestone criteria were met. MINI leased property from Foss and is no longer operating in the waterway. Foss is currently conducting active voluntary cleanup under Ecology oversight at the property for soil and groundwater contamination discovered after the original cleanup.

**Asarco Groundwater and Sediment (OU 06)**

**Groundwater**: Groundwater monitoring wells were installed in Fall 2021 and will be sampled each Spring and Fall until the development of the site is complete. At that point, EPA will evaluate the data and determine whether additional groundwater actions need to occur to ensure that groundwater discharging to Commencement Bay meets Washington’s Water Quality Standards.

**Sediment:** Point Ruston capped approximately 10 acres of offshore sediments between November 2006 and February 2007 but could not place the cap under the dock structures due to interference with the pilings. Point Ruston and the Washington State DNR worked together to remove the docks in 2010. DNR capped the dock footprints and some of the adjacent areas with between 1 to 2.5 feet of sand utilizing a total of 17,381 tons. In the intertidal areas that are subject to wave action DNR placed 2,627 tons of quarry spalls. Point Ruston installed the final 8 acres of cap in 2013.

However, the area in the Yacht Basin and offshore of the Breakwater Peninsula has not been cleaned up. EPA is preparing to sample these areas to determine if the remedy described in the cleanup plan is still valid. EPA will be coordinating with Metro Parks Tacoma (the landowner) and Tacoma Yacht Club and Breakwater Yacht Club (the tenants) to conduct this sampling in 2023 and 2024.

**Asarco Demolition (OU 07)**

Asarco began demolition of the building structures and smelter stack at the former Tacoma Smelter Facility in 1990 and completed this interim action in 1995.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

**Commencement Bay Sediments (OU 01)**

The Blair Waterway and St. Paul Waterway have been partially deleted from the NPL. The Thea Foss Waterway, Middle Waterway, and Olympic View Resource Area are ready to be partially deleted from the NPL.

Areas still requiring remedial activities include the Hylebos Waterway and Sitcum Waterway.

**Asarco Tacoma Smelter Facility (OU 02)**

Remedial action is ongoing and scheduled to be completed in June 2022.

**Tacoma Tar Pits (OU 03)**

Groundwater remediation is ongoing.

**Asarco Off-property (Ruston/Tacoma Yards Study Area – OU 04)**

Remediation of Yards in the Study area is ongoing and scheduled to be completed in 2024.

**Source Control (OU 05)**

Source control actions have been completed for the Blair Waterway and St. Paul Waterway. Source control actions are tentatively complete in the Thea Foss Waterway, Middle Waterway, and Sitcum Waterway. Source control actions need to be completed in the Hylebos Waterway at the Arkema and Occidental Sites.

| Area | Source control actions |
| --- | --- |
| Blair Waterway | complete |
| St. Paul Waterway | complete |
| Thea Foss Waterway | tentatively complete |
| Middle Waterway | tentatively complete |
| Sitcum Waterway | tentatively complete |
| Hylebos Waterway | need to be completed at the Arkema and Occidental Sites |

**Asarco Groundwater and Sediment (OU 06)**

The groundwater wells are scheduled to be installed in Spring 2021. Monitoring will determine if the remedial actions taken under OU 02 meet the performance standards.

Remediation of the sediment offshore of the former Asarco Tacoma Smelter Facility have been completed. Remediation of the Yacht Basin and moderately impacted area is scheduled to be completed in 2024.

**Asarco Demolition (OU 07)**

Demolition of the former Asarco Tacoma Smelter Facility is complete.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Removal actions at this Site are interim or partial response actions taken within the Site to abate or control a time-sensitive threat to human health or the environment.

**There are five removal actions associated with OU 01:**

- Puyallup Land Claim
- General Metals
- Olympic View Resource Area (OVRA)
- Blair Waterway Tributyltin (TBT)
- Occidental Chemical.

There was an additional removal action associated with OU 04.

**Puyallup Land Claim**

As part of the 1988 Puyallup Land Claim settlement, the Port of Tacoma dredged approximately 874,600 cubic yards of contaminated sediments from Blair Waterway and disposed in the Milwaukee Waterway Nearshore Confined Disposal Facility. Additional actions have been taken at the following properties:

**Inner Hylebos Property:** The buried fuel tanks at the former service station were removed in 1988. Site rehabilitation and cleanup, including removal of wood and concrete structures, an above-ground diesel fuel tank, oil-contaminated soil, and upland wood debris were completed in 1990 by Foss Maritime Co., Inc. (Foss), the Port's former tenant at the site.

In 1991, EPA issued a UAO to the Port of Tacoma to perform remove oily soil/sawdust and buried crushed drums on the Peninsula and auto refuse material along East 11th Street. In July, log-banding cables and decomposing bark and wood were removed from areas exposed above -3.5 ft MLLW in the intertidal area adjacent to the Log Yard uplands.

In 1992, a remedial investigation report concluded that no further action was required. The contaminated sediment offshore of this property was included in the remedial action for the Mouth of Hylebos. All sediment in areas where contaminant concentrations exceed the cleanup goals was removed, and EPA approved the RACR in August 2011.

**Upper Hylebos Property:** In 1991, an investigation report provided sufficient information to determine that cleanup of this property was not required.

**Taylor Way Property:** In 1996, EPA deleted the upland property from the National Priorities List (NPL) because all required cleanup had been completed in this area.

The sediment cleanup offshore of the Taylor Way Property was included in the Mouth of Hylebos cleanup action. In 2004, approximately 90,000 cubic yards of sediment was removed and disposed of in the Slip 1 NCDF.

**East-West Road Property:** In 1996, EPA deleted this property from the NPL because all required cleanup had been completed.

**Blair Waterway Property:** In 1996, EPA deleted this property from the NPL because all required cleanup had been completed.

**Blair Backup Property:** The Port cleaned up this property in 1993 by excavating approximately 4,100 cubic yards of charcoal briquette-laden soil and backfilling the excavation and placing that material along with the 14,600 cubic yards of Blair Waterway property slag/soil, 850 cubic yards of sandblast grit-contaminated soil, and 80 cubic yards of Weyerhaeuser Ditch sediments on a 7-acre portion of the property. This material was placed on a 6-inch buffer of sand and gravel and then covered with 6-inches of crushed rock, 3 inches of asphalt with a central paving fabric, and topped with additional 8 inches of crushed rock. The remaining 10 acres of the property was covered with 2 feet of sand and gravel. Port of Tacoma completed the construction in January 1994.

In 1996, EPA deleted this property from the NPL because all required cleanup had been completed.

To compensate for the loss of intertidal estuarine habitat as a result of filling of the Lincoln Street ditch in 1995, the Outer Hylebos Mitigation site was constructed, but for the most part it proved unsuccessful. EPA approved the Contingency Plans for the Hylebos Peninsula Mitigation Site and the Outer Hylebos Mitigation Site in 2011. The Puyallup Tribe constructed both mitigation sites in 2012. As-built drawings were provided in December 2012; however, the EPA has not received the technical memorandum for the As-Built Report.

**General Metals**

In October 1998, General Metals began construction of the cap located beneath the General Metals dock in the Hylebos Waterway. This work was completed in 1999. There was minor repairs in 2001 after a docked ship damaged several pier pilings located within the cap footprint. While cap had no significant damage, new pilings were put in and additional cap material was placed around the new pilings. In 2007-08, a remedial action to remove scrap steel along the cap toe berm caused minor damage, which was repaired in early 2009.

**Olympic View Resource Area (OVRA)**

In 2001, the City of Tacoma performed a non-time-critical removal action to address approximately 3 acres of contaminated marine sediments at OVRA. The Removal Action took place in 2002 and encompassed 2.3 acres. Approximately 600 wooden piles and 11,438 tons of contaminated sediment and debris were removed from the nearshore area and disposed of in an off-site upland landfill. Approximately one acre of marine sediments was capped with clean material.

The Removal Action was completed in March 2003. Long-term monitoring of the cap is ongoing. In 2015, it was observed that the cap sand material was eroding from under the beach protection layer (cobbles and gravels). In 2020, the City performed a repair of the cap and surrounding area.

**Blair Waterway Tributyltin**

In February 2015, the Port agreed to perform a removal action and pay past costs for cleaning up the site. Approximately 71,000 cubic yards of TBT‐contaminated sediment was dredged and sent to an off-site landfill for disposal. The Removal Action field activities were completed in March 2016.

**Occidental Chemical**

A non-time-critical removal action was taken at Area 5106 between October 2002 and February 2003 to removed sediment contaminated with chlorinated organic chemicals. Post removal investigations were conducted to delineate the nature and extent of remaining subsurface sediment and groundwater contamination in this area, and indicated that PCE, TCE, hexachlorobenzene, and hexachlorobutadiene were present at concentrations greater than their respective cleanup goals. The remaining work required under the Area 5106 UAO was incorporated into the Occidental Site AOC as amended in 2005.

A removal action was planned Embankment Area but was never implemented. Contamination in this area and will addressed through remedial actions under the ROD.
