### Background

Velsicol Chemical Corp. (formerly Michigan Chemical Corp.) produced various chemical compounds and products at its 54-acre main plant site in St. Louis, Mich., from 1936 to 1978. Products included the fire retardant polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) and the pesticide DDT. To address contamination discovered at the former plant site, Velsicol, EPA and the state of Michigan entered a consent agreement in 1982. Velsicol agreed to construct a slurry wall around the former plant site and put a clay cap over it. The Pine River, which borders the former main plant site on three sides, was significantly contaminated, which caused the state of Michigan to issue a no-consumption advisory for all fish species.

From 1998 to 2006, actions taken at the site addressed contamination in the Pine River at a cost of over $100 million. From 1998 to 2006, EPA funded a sediment cleanup in the Pine River adjacent to the site. Over 670,000 cubic yards of DDT-contaminated sediment were removed and disposed of off-site in an approved landfill. DDT levels in fish have been reduced by over 98 percent, but the state plans to keep the fish advisory in place until the entire site has been cleaned up.

In early 2000s, studies showed the slurry wall and clay cap at the main plant site were failing to keep contamination out of the river. In response, EPA and Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) launched a remedial investigation and feasibility study at the main plant site. The resulting report stated that soil and groundwater were contaminated. The study identified areas with high concentrations of contaminants known as “potential source areas.” EPA evaluated different cleanup alternatives to address contamination at the site and, in June 2006, selected a remedy that included a comprehensive cleanup of the main plant site and a residential soil cleanup. During the residential cleanup, EPA excavated and disposed of 50,000 tons of contaminated soil at an off-site landfill. Currently, EPA and MDEQ are completing what’s called a “Remedial Investigation” in the Pine River downstream of the former chemical plant property.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**Drinking Water Supply**

In May 2014, construction began for the replacement of the city of St. Louis drinking water supply. St. Louis and Alma formed a joint water authority called the Gratiot Area Water Authority (GAWA). In October 2015, St. Louis switched to the new GAWA drinking water. A summary of completed construction activities is included below.

- Expansion of Alma’s water treatment plant.
- Construction of water mains from Alma water treatment plant to St. Louis.
- Construction of two booster pump stations for new water mains.
- Construction of an elevated water tank in St. Louis.
- Installation of new water wells.

**Main Plant Site**

The two largest contaminated areas on the site are referred to as Areas 1 and 2. The following is a list of completed cleanup activities.

- Design and cleanup of residential area.
- In situ (in-place) thermal treatment for Area 1.
- Excavation design for potential source areas.
- Predesign investigation for additional potential source areas.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

**Five-Year Review**

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s cleanup. These reviews ensure that the cleanups put in place protect public health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. EPA completed the [sixth five-year review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/976690.pdf) (38 pp, 1.52MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) of the site in August 2022. EPA worked with a facilitator from the Consensus Building Institute, or CBI, a non-profit organization specializing in citizen engagement, to speak with area residents as part of the five-year review process. Information provided during the interviews was reflected in the five-year review and is also being used to update EPA’s Community Involvement Plan for the site.

The five-year review concluded that the remedy at Operable Unit 1 (OU1) is expected to be protective once all the remedy components are completed. The review also concluded that the remedy at OU2 continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short-term. However, for the remedy to be effective in the long-term in OU2, a long-term monitoring plan for DDT levels in fish tissue and sediment needs to be developed and implemented, and an Institutional Control Implementation and Assurance Plan needs to be developed and implemented. Finally, the review determined throughout the site (site-wide), that the remedy is expected to be protective once the remaining remedy components have been implemented. Nevertheless, remedial activities completed to date throughout the site have adequately addressed all exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks.

**Velsicol Plant Site**

On the week of October 17, 2022, EPA and EGLE are starting a new cleanup phase at the former Velsicol plant site. This new phase consists of excavating approximately 100,000 tons of contaminated soil from the southern portion of the former Velsicol Plant property and trucking this material off-site for disposal in a permitted landfill. Shoring will be placed around a portion of an excavation area in the southeast boundary of the former plant site. The shoring consisting of metal sheet piling will prevent the excavation area from collapsing and will not be removed. The entire excavation work is expected to be completed by December 2023.

EPA and EGLE will provide an in-person availability session on **Wednesday, October 12, 2022** from **4:30 to 7:30 p.m. EST**. in the **Community Room of St. Louis City Hall, 300 N Mill St., St. Louis**. Representatives from both agencies will answer questions and talk one-on-one with members of the public regarding the upcoming project at the former Velsicol Plant site.

Additional information regarding the upcoming work at the plant site and about the availability session is available in the [Announcements and Key Topics section](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.Stayup&id=0502194#Announce) of this website and in [EPA’s October 2022 factsheet(PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/978057.pdf) (2 pp, 433K, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ).

The in-place thermal treatment on the former plant site was completed in the fall of 2021 and approximately 386,000 pounds of contaminants were removed from the soil.

EPA and EGLE, continue to work on design studies for future cleanup activities that will take place on the former chemical plant site.

**Pine River Downstream**

EPA issued a [proposed cleanup plan (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/975869.pdf) (46 pp, 5.07MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) for operable unit 3, or OU3, in July 2022. OU3 begins at the St. Louis dam to approximately 1.5 miles downstream within the Pine River. OU3 includes sediment, riverbanks and four floodplains within the Pine River. EPA hosted a virtual public meeting on the proposed cleanup plan on July 26, 2026 and a public comment period on the proposed plan took place from July 15 to August 13. EPA is reviewing the comments received and will provide a response to the comments received in a Responsiveness Summary.

EPA's [OU3 Proposed Cleanup Plan factsheet (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/975866.pdf) (8pp, 1.59MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) provides a summary of the proposed plan, describes cleanup options, and explains EPA’s recommendation. A [video presentation](https://youtu.be/DZ2JJC9MEtc) (YouTube) on the proposed cleanup plan is also available to the public.

The proposed cleanup plan includes excavating floodplain and riverbank soils with DDT contamination and disposing the soil at an approved landfill. The floodplains would be backfilled with clean soils to the existing grade and revegetated. The riverbank would be stabilized to prevent further erosion.

Operable Unit 4 (OU4) is located is from the boundary of OU3 in the Pine River to the Chippewa River. OU4 is in the Remedial Investigation phase of the Superfund process and appears less affected by contamination than OU3. EPA continues monitoring a field pilot study using an activated carbon technology for potential application in OU4. The results of the field pilot study will be incorporated into a second feasibility study for OU4. There is compelling evidence that carbon is effective at binding to contaminants like DDT reducing its ability to harm the environment. Alma College is performing supporting work for the study using Solid Phase Micro-Extraction (SPME), which is a specialized test to assess how animals in the ecosystem absorb chemicals like DDT. That absorption process is known as "bioavailability." This testing will help scientists understand how much the carbon reduces bioavailability of contaminants to animals.

**Velsicol Burn Pit**

EPA signed a Record of Decision for the cleanup of the Velsicol Burn Pit in July 2015. The remedy called for using in-place thermal treatment of source contamination, which is primarily in a Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (NAPL) state.

EPA completed the final design for the hook-up of nine homes to St. Louis municipal drinking water and the site preparation for in-place thermal treatment. This will include removal of the remnant burn debris material.

The start date of the Remedial Action cleanup and the total time necessary for completion are dependent on contracting and funding availability. Additional information is available on the [Velsicol Burn Pit website](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/velsicol-burnpit).

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

On-site groundwater is contaminated with DDT, chlorobenzene, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene (TCE), and other chlorinated compounds. Onsite soil samples revealed contamination with PBBs, copper, chromium, zinc, and magnesium. The sediments of the Pine River were also contaminated with similar contaminants through direct discharges from the site; however, surface waters do not show any significant impacts. Potential risks exist for people who eat contaminated fish and wildlife in the vicinity of the site.
