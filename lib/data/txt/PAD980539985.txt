### Background

The 13.5-acre Blosenski Landfill Site is located in West Caln Township, Pennsylvania. Disposal of municipal and industrial wastes at the unlined landfill took place at the site from the 1950s until the 1980s. Wastes disposed of at the landfill included solvents, paints, leaking drums and tank truck contents. These activities contaminated soil, surface and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Site is being addressed through Potentially Responsible Party actions.

The cleanup of the Blosenski Landfill was done in four phases:

1. In 1990, the public water system was extended to 75 residents so they would not have to rely on contaminated well water;
2. About 1,300 buried drums were excavated in 1992 and 1995, containing hazardous solids and liquids, and about 350 cubic yards of waste and soils were shipped off-site for proper disposal;
3. Groundwater monitoring wells were installed from 1990 to 1996 to characterize groundwater contamination, and in 1998, a groundwater treatment system was completed to remove contamination from the area’s aquifer. Periodic groundwater monitoring is conducted and discharge from the treatment system is monitored to ensure that it meets federal standards; and
4. A landfill cap was completed in 1995 to prevent rainwater from coming in contact with the landfill’s materials, and leaching contamination into the soil and groundwater.

EPA performed a vapor intrusion investigation in April and June of 2016. Vapor intrusion is a process that occurs when organic vapors from contaminated groundwater or soil move upwards through the ground into nearby buildings. Indoor vapor intrusion testing was conducted in many homes to the east and west of the site. EPA sampled from the sub-slab of these homes and also sampled outdoor ambient air and monitoring wells to the north and west of the site. The vapor intrusion investigation did not identify any levels that would pose a health concern and no further action is necessary in homes at this time.

Institutional Controls (ICs) are administrative controls that help to minimize the potential for exposure to contamination and protect the integrity of a response action. ICs typically work by limiting land and/or resource use by providing information that helps modify or guide human behavior at a Site. A Notice of Contamination (NOC) was filed at the Chester County Recorder of Deeds on September 21, 2017. This notice will inform the public on the contaminants of concern at the Site as well restrictions on the use of the Site. EPA continues to pursue a more formalized Environmental Covenant for additional Site protection.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 2013, EPA prepared an Explanation of Significant Difference that modified the remedy selected in the 1986 Record of Decision to describe the institutional controls required for the site; revise the list of groundwater contaminants of concern; and formally set the groundwater performance standard. EPA also began the preparation of an environmental covenant that lists the activity and land use restrictions required for the Site property to ensure that the remedy remains protective.

In October 2012, the groundwater pump and treat system was shut down so that the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) can study the aquifer and propose another method of groundwater remediation. The 2013 Five-Year Review determined that the remedies for Operable Units (OUs) 1, 2, and 4 are protective of human health and the environment, but a determination of protectiveness for OU3 was delayed pending additional steps, including completing a review of the effect of turning off the pump and treat system, revising the list of contaminants of concern, and developing and implementing institutional controls.

In July 2015, a pilot study to determine the effectiveness of in-situ groundwater treatment was started. Results of the July 2015 study were reviewed by EPA and the PRP's contractor. EPA provided recommendations and comments on the bioremedation process.

EPA performed a vapor intrusion investigation in 2016 and determined that vapor intrusion is not an issue for this Site.

The PRP's contractor submitted an addendum to the groundwater bioremedation study in July 2017, which addressed EPA's comments and recommendations. The second phase of the bioremedation study began with additional on-site treatment in January 2018 with monitoring that followed in March, June, September, and planned for December of 2018. Data from these monitoring events showed that groundwater Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) levels have decreased to below Maximum Contaminant Levels in most wells at the Site. A Focused Feasibility Study was submitted to EPA in January of 2020 to discuss a possible change in remedy to bioremediation or other options to address the remaining low levels of VOC contamination.

The Focused Feasibility Study was approved by EPA and the State in September of 2020. A Proposed Remedial Action Plan (PRAP) was drafted by EPA late 2020 and was approved on December 9, 2021. The PRAP details the logic behind the decision to change the current remedy from the current groundwater extraction treatment system (GWETS) to the more efficient and cost effective Enhanced In-Situ Bioremediation (EISB). The Proposed Plan was released for public comment for a period that started on December 15, 2021 through January 31, 2022. The purpose of the public comment period is to allow for the public to express any comments or concerns on the proposed change of remedy for the Site. EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) Amendment in September 2022, which includes a Responsiveness Summary, responding to any public comments received during the Proposed Plan comment period.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent, [2023 Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/03/2355127.pdf) (PDF), concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2028.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional Controls (ICs) are in place to prevent residential use of the Site, disturbance of the landfill cap, prohibit groundwater use and require any new construction at the Site to be equipped with a vapor barrier to prevent vapor intrusion. Additional information about the ICs is available in the [2018 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2265111) (page 8).

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup also included a removal action, or short-term cleanup, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. The removal action in 1982 included draining and disposing of liquid wastes found in on-site tank trucks and drums.
