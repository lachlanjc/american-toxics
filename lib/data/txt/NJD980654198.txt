### Background

The Myers Property site is located in Franklin Township, New Jersey. The site includes about five acres of land currently owned by Arkema Inc. (Arkema), a potentially responsible party (PRP) for the site, and about two acres of wetlands owned by the State of New Jersey. In the 1940s, several companies manufactured pesticides at the eight-acre site. Elf Atochem, now Arkema, purchased the site property in 1993.

Four companies used parts of the site for pesticide and chemical handling and manufacturing activities: W.A. Allen Company, Elko Chemical Works, the Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Company and Clinton Chemical Company. The first two companies no longer exist. The Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Company became Pennwalt Corporation, and Clinton Chemical Company is now Witco Corporation.

The W.A. Allen Company owned the site property from 1928 to 1932. Elko Chemical Works operated a pesticide production plant at the site from 1942 to 1945, manufacturing the insecticide p,p'dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, commonly called DDT. The Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Company bought the site property in 1945. It operated the DDT-production plant for two years. In 1947, the Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Company sold the site property to Associated Terminal, Inc. Associated Terminal leased the property to the Clinton Chemical Company from 1953 to 1959. It produced anhydrous aluminum chloride. The Myers family purchased the property in 1971 and used it for residential and farming purposes. They sold it to Elf Atochem in 1993.

When the site was first identified, several buildings were present on the site, including a mill dating to 1827. Various drummed chemicals, as well as uncontained asbestos, were present. The site is now vacant except for a groundwater treatment system. The construction for the groundwater treatment system was completed in September 1999. The privately owned portion of the site is fenced. A recreational trail which runs through the site is open to the public.

After initial actions to protect human health and the environment, and additional investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983.

Following initial actions to protect human health and the environment, the site’s long-term remedy was put in place. Groundwater treatment and monitoring is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Initial Actions: In 1984, EPA removed visibly contaminated material for off-site disposal. Material included contaminated soil, drummed wastes, asbestos and debris. EPA fenced the most highly contaminated areas in 1987 and posted warning signs at the perimeter of the site.

Long-term Cleanup: After investigating the nature and extent of contamination at the site, EPA selected a remedy to address contaminated soil, sediments, buildings and groundwater in the site’s September 1990 Record of Decision, or ROD. The multi-part remedy consisted of excavating soils and sediments, treating the soil with chemical dechlorination coupled with soil washing to remove inorganic contaminants, and backfilling the treated soil on site. The groundwater remedy included an extraction and treatment system to capture migrating contaminants. As a part of the remedy, groundwater is monitored to make sure it does not affect potable wells in the area. Wells are also tested periodically as a precaution.

Buildings: Buildings were dismantled in late 1997 and remediation was completed in 1998. Because of the deterioration of the 1827 mill, it was not possible to preserve the entire structure. Working with the National Park Service and the New Jersey Historic Preservation Office, Arkema documented past use of the mill and property through photographs and architectural drawings to create a permanent record before the buildings were removed. Arkema was able to decontaminate and preserve the stone foundation of the historic mill.

Soil and Sediment: A combination of low-temperature thermal treatment and chemical dechlorination was found to be effective in treating pesticides, dioxins and other organic contaminants during treatability studies required by the 1990 ROD. Soil washing treatment to remove arsenic was not successful, however. Because on-site treatment was not feasible, EPA updated the soil and sediment remedy in a July 2000 ROD to include excavation of contaminated soil and sediment to the depth of the water table, with off-site disposal of the contaminated material. Field work for that portion of the remedial action took place between spring 2003 and June 2005.

Groundwater: The site’s groundwater treatment system has been in operation since October 1999 and a final groundwater treatment remedy, consisting of the continuation of the existing treatment system with periodic review, was selected in September 2005. The system captures migrating contaminants and reintroduces treated water into the ground. Primary contaminants of concern (COCs) include benzene and chlorobenzene. The system is reducing the concentrations of contamination and preventing migration of contaminants off site. No residential wells have been affected and they are sampled regularly to ensure that they remain safe. The treatment system operates in a building located on the old mill foundation.

A five-year review of the remedy was completed in January 2023. The report concluded that the remedy remains protective of human health and the environment. A link to that report is available in the Annoucements and Key Topics Section of this page. Additional five-year reviews will be conducted, as necessary.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In September 2005, a Preliminary Close-Out Report for the site was approved because all construction activities at the site had been completed.

Groundwater treatment and monitoring at the site is ongoing. Maintenance on the system is being performed as necessary.
