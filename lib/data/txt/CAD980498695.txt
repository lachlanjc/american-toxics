### Background

From 1942 to 1946, the 22-acre McColl site in Fullerton, California, was a disposal area for petroleum refinery waste. During that period, 72,600 cubic yards of waste were deposited in 12 unlined pits, or sumps. Refinery operations took place on land located north and northwest of the site. During the 1950s and early 1960s, in an attempt to control site odors, the operator covered the three sumps in the Ramparts area with drilling mud. In the late 1950s, during the nearby construction of a golf course, the operator covered six sumps at the lower end of the property with natural fill materials. Placement of additional soil cover on the upper Ramparts sumps took place in 1983. Residences were later built on land next to the site. Eventually, the golf course expanded to include the closed site.

Residents complained to regulatory agencies about odors and health issues beginning in 1978. A remedy was selected by EPA to cap the site to prevent water from infiltrating the waste, prevent the wastes from moving off-site, prevent contact with buried wastes, and collecting gasses generated by the wastes and treating them. Following construction of the remedy, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Initial actions included restricting access to the site and placing a 24-hour security guard at the site.

*Soil and Waste:* The site’s long-term remedy included excavation and off-site disposal of wastes. EPA later updated the remedy, replacing off-site waste disposal with thermal destruction. EPA updated the remedy again in 1993 to include partial solidification of tar waste in the sumps, with a contingency remedy of closing the sump wastes. Treatability studies determined that solidification of tar waste was not feasible and EPA selected the contingency remedy in 1995. This remedy included a cap over the sumps and a below-grade soil slurry wall around the sumps.

*Groundwater:* The long-term remedy for groundwater included management of site surface water, lining major drainage channels with low permeability materials, grading or modifying areas next to the planned closure containment system, groundwater monitoring, institutional controls, and site maintenance and security. The construction of the cap and slurry wall finished in 1998. The system for collecting and treating subsurface gases under the cap is fully functional and operational.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy, the most recent in September 2017. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### Enforcement Information

The operations of the remedy and the annual maintenance and sampling is conducted by the responsible parties under a [Unilateral Administrative Order.](https://sems.epa.gov/work/1501612886099/09-88105648.pdf)
