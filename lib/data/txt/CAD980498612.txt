### Background

The IMM site is located in the Klamath Mountains approximately nine miles northwest of Redding, California in the West Shasta Mining District. The 4,400-acre site includes portions of the Spring Creek, Boulder Creek, and Slickrock Creek watersheds.

From the 1860s to about 1963, the site was periodically mined for iron, silver, gold, copper, zinc and sulfide-containing minerals. At one time, the IMM was [reported to be the largest copper mine in California.](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/california-water-science-center/science/iron-mountain-extraordinary-and-extreme-environment) Mining and ore processing exposed underground metal ore and waste rock to oxygen, rainwater, and groundwater. Those processes caused the formation of acidic mine drainage (AMD) with elevated concentrations of copper, cadmium, zinc, and other metals which seeped and flowed into local streams and ultimately into the Sacramento River.

Before cleanup, the acidic metal-rich water virtually eliminated aquatic life in local creeks and caused periodic fish kills in the Sacramento River. The Sacramento River downstream of the site provides habitat for multiple threatened or endangered species, including the Sacramento

River winter-run Chinook salmon, Central Valley spring-run Chinook Salmon, and certain Steelhead Trout and North American green sturgeon populations. The Sacramento River is also the source of drinking water to the city of Redding and others downstream of the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA added IMM to the Superfund National Priorities List in 1983.

Initial EPA efforts in the 1980s and early 1990s to limit the impacts of AMD from the site included stabilizing and/or covering (“capping”) exposed mine wastes to prevent mobilization of contaminants; diversion of clean stream water from Slickrock Creek and Upper Spring Creek away from contaminated areas; and operation of emergency treatment plants to neutralize AMD during the rainy season.

A permanent treatment plant, known as the Minnesota Flats Treatment Plant (MFTP), began operation in 1994, treating AMD from the Richmond and Lawson Mines, the two largest sources of contamination. In the late 1990s and early 2000s the AMD collection, conveyance, and treatment systems were expanded and improved. Improvements included the collection of AMD from the Slickrock Creek watershed, conversion of the MFTP to use a high density sludge (HDS) process, an increase in the capacity of the treatment plant, and additional AMD storage capacity.

Ongoing cleanup efforts include the following actions:

\- Operation and maintenance of dams and other infrastructure to collect acidic mine drainage (AMD) in the Richmond, Lawson, and Old/No. 8 mines;

\- Operation and maintenance of the Slickrock Creek Dam and Retention Reservoir, which collects and can store up to 75 million gallons of AMD from the Slickrock Creek watershed;

\- Maintenance of more than 5 miles of pipeline to transport the AMD from the collection locations to the Minnesota Flats treatment facility (MFTP);

\- Operation and maintenance of a 9 million gallon per day (MGD) “high density sludge” treatment facility which uses lime to neutralize and remove metal contaminants from the AMD;

\- Maintenance of the Slickrock Creek and Upper Spring Creek clean water diversions;

\- Transport of sludge generated by the MFTP to an onsite landfill and maintenance of the landfill (the “Brick Flat Pit Landfill”);

\- Maintenance of caps stabilizing and/or covering exposed mine wastes.

These cleanup actions are generally described in four EPA Records of Decision adopted between 1986 and 1997 for Operable Units [1](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/09/100002382)[,](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/09/100002382)[2](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/09/56145), [3](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/09/56558) and [4](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/09/58279).

In 2004, EPA adopted a [Record of Decision for Operable Unit 05](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/09/2039286), which called for removal of metal contaminated sediment from the “Spring Creek Arm” of Keswick Reservoir. About 155,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediment were removed and disposed onsite. The California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) is responsible for periodically inspecting and maintaining the onsite disposal area.

During periods of heavy rainfall, EPA’s cleanup efforts may rely on the Spring Creek Debris Dam and the Shasta Dam to dilute contaminant discharges from the Site. The two dams are operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. There have been no site-related exceedances of water quality criteria in the Sacramento River immediately downstream of the site since 2004.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Efforts continue to operate and maintain the cleanup facilities. Those efforts include operation, maintenance, and inspection of the AMD collection, conveyance, and treatment system; inspection and maintenance of the clean water diversions; and inspection and maintenance of capped wastes. The site operator provides monthly progress reports, an annual operations report, and several inspection reports each year.

Operation and maintenance are currently performed in accordance with a [2013 Statement of Work for Site Operations and Maintenance](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/09/2346835) and EPA-approved plans and reports.

EPA cleanup efforts have greatly reduced impacts on aquatic life, reducing the amount of contamination released into the environment by more than 95%. [The figure](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/images/sspp/R09/0901755_picture003.png) shows the reduction in the concentration of copper in surface water at the downstream end of the site (in lower Spring Creek).

### Enforcement Information

In the 1970s and 1980s, the state of [California issued enforcement orders](https://geotracker.waterboards.ca.gov/profile_report?global_id=L10003903915) to limit the discharge of copper and other contaminants from the site and reduce impacts on aquatic life in the Sacramento River.

EPA added IMM to the Superfund National Priorities List in 1983. Between 1989 and 1997, EPA issued seven enforcement orders to Potentially Responsible Parties to conduct cleanup work at the site. The work included construction of the upper Spring Creek clean water diversion structure, construction and seasonal operation of temporary AMD collection and treatment systems, and construction and operation of a permanent AMD treatment system.

In 1991, the United States, on behalf of EPA, and the State of California filed a lawsuit against several Potentially Responsible Parties to remediate the site and pay for the governments’ cleanup costs.

The lawsuit was resolved in 2000 when a Federal Court approved an [IMM Consent Decree](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/09/83730) which required Potentially Responsible Parties to fund future cleanup work at the site. The Consent Decree committed certain parties to the settlement to operate and maintain the AMD collection and treatment system constructed in the 1990s and other components of the site remedies required by the OU1 through OU4 Records of Decision. The settlement included the purchase of an insurance policy to guarantee funding through 2030 (up to the policy limit of $301.7 million), an $8 million payment to the Department of Interior to compensate for natural resource damages and lost human-use caused by site contamination, and a commitment to pay $514 million to EPA and/or the state of California for cleanup work after 2030. As part of the settlement, EPA and the state of California agreed that the settling PRPs will not be held responsible for site cleanup costs after all requirements of the Consent Decree are met.

EPA and the State are developing plans for operation and maintenance of the AMD collection and treatment system and other components of the site remedies after 2030.

AIG Consultants, Inc., a party to the 2000 Consent Decree, has been the operator of the AMD collection and treatment system since about 2004.

Since 2000, most cleanup work at the site has been funded by PRPs in accordance with the 2000 Consent Decree. Exceptions include the dredging of metal contaminated sediment from the Spring Creek Arm of Keswick Reservoir in 2009-2010 in accordance with EPA’s OU5 Record of Decision, the inspection and maintenance of the onsite facility where the dredged sediments were disposed, and construction of the Slickrock Creek Dam and Retention Reservoir. EPA funded the dredging and dam construction; the State of California funds the [inspection and maintenance of the disposal facility](https://www.envirostor.dtsc.ca.gov/public/profile_report?global_id=45100001).
