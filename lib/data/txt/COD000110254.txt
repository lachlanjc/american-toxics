### Background

The 64-acre Broderick Wood Products (BWP) site is located in Adams County, Colorado. A wood treatment facility operated at the site from 1947 to 1982. BWP used creosote and pentachlorophenol (PCP) to treat power poles, fence posts, railroad ties and other wood products. Historical operations and disposal practices contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s long-term remedy included removal of sludges from two former impoundments, demolition and removal of buildings and structures in the former process area, construction of land-treatment units (LTUs) for contaminated soils, excavation of contaminated soils and placement in the LTUs, construction of a treatment system to collect and treat contaminated groundwater, construction of a bioventing system to treat the subsurface in the former process area, construction of a cutoff wall on the north side of the property to better contain the northward-moving groundwater, placement of a one-foot-thick soil cover throughout the property, and implementation of institutional controls. Construction of the remedy finished in September 1996.

In 2003, Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) approached site representatives about construction of a rail line embankment across the site. The massive project required significant amounts of time and effort by all parties, from the planning in mid-2003 to completion in late 2004. Ultimately, the project enhanced/retrofitted the original remedy. Among other improvements, the project added cutoff walls on the west and east sides of the site to enhance hydraulic control of contaminated groundwater in the shallow aquifer.

In 2002, the potentially responsible party (PRP) dismantled the bioventing system in the former process area. In 2006, it was determined that the soil in the LTUs had been treated to treatment levels. The LTUs will need to be capped, closed and maintained in accordance with Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) standards. A portion of LTUs will remain open in case contaminated soil is encountered during future redevelopment activities.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1984.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and PRP actions.

Current operation and maintenance activities include operating the groundwater treatment system and monitoring groundwater throughout the site.

EPA has conducted five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that the remedy at the site is not protective of human health and the environment. Since 2009, the remedy has been operated and maintained on a limited and sporadic basis and groundwater has not been monitored. EPA, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, and the PRP are working together to return the remedy to normal operation, maintenance and monitoring to ensure protectiveness.
