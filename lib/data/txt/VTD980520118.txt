### Background

The Darling Hill Dump site is an inactive dump on about 3.5 acres at the top of a steep hill along Darling Hill Road in rural Lyndon, Vermont. From 1952 to 1989, the dump was used for the disposal of municipal and industrial wastes, including metal plating rinse waters, alkali degreasers, and organic solvents. The investigation of the site revealed only low levels of contamination in the groundwater. Carbon filters were installed on the public water supply to remove the low-level contamination. EPA determined that no cleanup action was necessary and took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1999.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal and PRP actions.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In June 1992, EPA signed a Record of Decision stating that no further cleanup was necessary. Therefore, no additional response actions were planned for the site.

EPA placed the site on the NPL in 1989. Following site investigations, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1999.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional Controls are not required for this site.**

This site does not require ICs which means there is no contamination remaining at the site that could result in an unacceptable exposure and/or remedy components at the site that could be damaged. For additional information on this site, the site contacts should be consulted:

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
