### Background

The former Fort Devens Army Installation (Fort Devens) is located 35 miles west of Boston within the Towns of Ayer, Shirley, Lancaster and Harvard, Massachusetts. The former Fort Devens was established in 1917 for support during World War I and became a permanent base until its Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Committee closure in 1996. The Fort Devens Superfund Site was listed on EPA the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1989.

The Army and EPA signed a Federal Facility Agreement (FFA) in 1991. Under the FFA, Army is considered the lead agency and EPA provides oversight as the lead regulatory agency. Although not a signatory to the FFA, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) has a participatory role in the investigation and remediation process. The Army holds primary responsibility for investigation, design, construction, and operation and maintenance of all removal, response and remedial actions performed at the former military base. The Army evaluates Study Areas (SA) across the former federal facility where releases of contaminants are suspected or known to have occurred and determines whether those areas pose a threat or potential threat to human health and the environment and warrant more detailed investigation as an Area of Contamination (AOC). Of the 324 sites initially identified by Army, 54 were included in the FFA as probable SAs and AOCs. To date, all initially identified sites have been evaluated and determined to be suitable for reuse with no further action or warranting additional investigation, remediation and/or long-term monitoring to address current and/or potential risk to human health and/or the environment. Details regarding these sites are provided under "Cleanup Activities, What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?" below.

The Devens BRAC Cleanup Team (BCT), comprised of representatives from Army, MassDEP, MassDevelopment and EPA, was established in accordance with the Devens FFA, to meet or confer, as necessary, to review and discuss the status of ongoing investigation, cleanup, long-term groundwater and/or LUC monitoring activities at the sites discussed below.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Of the 54 sites identified as probable Study Areas (SAs) and Areas of Contamination (AOCs), all have been evaluated and either removed from further evaluation/action or have cleanup plans, known as Records of Decision (RODs), in place. Most of these sites are in the long-term monitoring (LTM) phase, where groundwater, surface water and/or sediments are monitored regularly. Sites where contamination remains above levels that allow for unrestricted use / unlimited exposure (UU/UE) have land-use controls (LUCs) in place and are inspected annually. Sites with ongoing cleanup actions (i.e. RODs), including LTM and LUC sites, must be evaluated at least every five years to ensure that the selected remedy (i.e. cleanup action) remains protective of human health and the environment. The Army is required to present the results of the evaluation in a draft [Five Year Review (FYR)](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0100966&doc=Y&colid=32375&region=01&type=SC) Report to MassDevelopment, MassDEP and EPA for review and comment. The most recent (2020) FYR Report for the Fort Devens Superfund site was issued by Army on September 28, 2020.. However, given the number of deficiencies and inconsistencies wtih EPA's FYR guidance and directives and Army's decision to forego incorporation of previously agreed upon revisions in the final FYR report, EPA issued an independent finding of protectiveness for each of the remedial actions at the former Fort Devens and necessary recommended actions required to address the deficiencies andensure long-term protectiveness on September 25, 2020. [Former Fort Devens 2020 Five-Year Review Independent Finding of Protectiveness, Summary of Issues and Recommendations and OU-specific and Sitewide Protectiveness Statements](https://sems.epa.gov/work/1619733847162/01-100015698.pdf)..

**AOCs 4, 5 and 18 - Shepley’s Hill Landfill**  
Shepley's Hill Landfill (SHL) encompasses approximately 84 acres in the northeast corner of the former Main Post area of Fort Devens. The landfill is bordered to the northeast by Plow Shop Pond (PSP), to the west by Shepley’s Hill, to the south by commercial development, and to the east by a former railroad roundhouse. Nonacoicus Brook, which drains Plow Shop Pond, is located north of the landfill in the North Impact Area (NIA). According to available military records, the landfill operated from 1917 to 1992 as the primary waste disposal site and for some period of time included open burning of a waste incinerator. A Remedial Investigation (RI) and supplemental RI were performed at SHL between 1991 and 1993. Results confirmed the presence of various inorganic and organic contaminants in groundwater, sediment, and surface water at and adjacent to SHL. Potential human exposure to arsenic in groundwater was identified as the primary risk driver. The selected remedy was memorialized in a 1995 ROD and included landfill closure, landfill maintenance, long-term groundwater monitoring, landfill gas monitoring, institutional controls, and FYRs. The ROD also included a contingency remedy of groundwater extraction and discharge to a public-owned treatment works in the event the 1995 remedy was ineffective in attaining cleanup goals by 2008.

Due to continued detection of site contaminants exceeding cleanup goals and realization that cleanup goals would not be attained within the timeframe specified in the ROD, the Army constructed and implemented a groundwater extraction and treatment system in March 2006 along the northern edge of the landfill.

A vertical barrier wall was installed along the east portion of the landfill as part of a 2012 Non-Time Critical Removal Action (NTCRA) to mitigate the migration of arsenic-contaminated groundwater to Red Cove/Plow Shop Pond. (See " *AOC 72* - *Red Cove/Plow Shop Pond"* below).

In October 2012, an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) incorporated additional LUCs into the 1995 ROD to address potential risks to residential receptors from arsenic-contaminated SHL groundwater. Additionally, the Town of Ayer placed a moratorium on the installation of groundwater wells within and downgradient of the NIA in January 2013 to further reduce potential residential exposure to contaminated SHL groundwater migrating beyond the base boundary.

In response to concerns raised in the 2015 and 2020 Fort Devens FYR Reports, supplemental investigations are underway to evaluate the effectiveness of the SHL remedy, specifically the ability of the groundwater extraction and treatment system to contain arsenic-contaminated SHL groundwater at the base boundary, achieve cleanup goals and ensure long-term protection of human health and the environment.

The SHL property remains in Army ownership and is available for reuse via a lease agreement with MassDevelopment.

**AOC 72 - Red Cove/Plow Shop Pond (PSP) / SA 71 - Former Railroad Roundhouse**  
PSP is a 30-acre, man-made pond that receives inflow from Grove Pond to the east and uses a concrete dam to maintain/control water levels. PSP and Grove Pond are both in an Area of Critical Environmental Concern, a Commonwealth of Massachusetts-designated area of ecological significance near a protected species habitat. "Red Cove" refers to an area of arsenic-contaminated sediments located in the southwest corner of PSP along the northeast perimeter of SHL. The former Railroad Roundhouse, operated by the Boston and Maine Railroad from approximately 1900 to 1935, consists of a 200- to 300-foot wide strip of land extending south from PSP along the northeast boundary of Devens. Historical features include railroad tracks, a coal trestle, ash pit, water tower, and several buildings. The railroad roundhouse was located at the northern end of this strip, immediately adjacent to the southern shore of PSP. The shoreline adjacent to the railroad roundhouse is the location of the Maintenance By-Product Disposal Area that was used as a disposal area for locomotive maintenance waste.

PSP was initially evaluated as part of the SHL site. Results of these investigations revealed metals, primarily arsenic, in sediments along the western edge of the pond. PSP was designated AOC 72 and supplemental investigations commenced at PSP and Grove Pond with EPA taking the lead on the Grove Pond investigation and Army leading the surface water and sediment investigations in Red Cove and along the southern shoreline of the railroad roundhouse. Following these limited investigations, Army conducted a RI for AOC 72 in 2011, confirming ongoing impacts to Red Cove/PSP sediments from the discharge of arsenic-impacted groundwater from SHL. As recommended in the RI (and mentioned in " *AOCs 4, 5 and 18 - Shepley’s Hill Landfill"* above *)*, Army commenced a NTCRA in 2012 to address impacts to Red Cove/PSP sediments caused by the discharge of contaminated groundwater from SHL. The removal action included the installation of a vertical barrier wall between SHL and PSP (to mitigate future potential impacts) and the excavation of contaminated sediments from the Red Cove area and shoreline of the railroad roundhouse (to address historic/existing impacts).

In response to concerns raised in the 2020 FYR Report, additional baseline and five-year review pore water and sediment sampling will be performed in the Red Cove area of Plow Shop Pond to monitor barrier wall performance (and ongoing success of AOC 72 removal action).

**Devens Consolidation Landfill (DCL) and DCL Contributor Sites (SAs12 and 13; AOCs 9, 11, 40 and 41); and, Former Grant, Locust, and Cavite Housing Areas**

In accordance with the July 1999 ROD, Army constructed the approximate 25-acre DCL on the former Fort Devens golf course driving range between September 2000 and November 2002 to accommodate excavated material from the following AOCs and SAs (collectively referred to as the "DCL Contributor Sites"):

- SA 12 - A half-acre location where construction debris and yard waste were deposited, (approx. 8,700 cubic yards (cy) excavated);
- SA 13 - A one-acre area used from 1965 to the mid-1990s for yard-waste, (approx. 10,000 cy excavated);
- AOC 9 - An area used for storing wood, concrete, asphalt, metal, brick, glass, and tree stumps, (approx. 121,000 cy excavated);
- AOC 11 - A former landfill used from 1975 to 1980 for disposal of wood-frame hospital demolition debris (approx. 35,000 cy excavated);
- AOC 40 - Four acres used for construction debris, ash, stumps, and logs, (approx. 125,400 cy excavated);
- AOC 41 - A one quarter-acre landfill in the SPIA that was used up to the 1950s for disposal of non- explosive material and household debris (approx. 1,500 cy excavated); and,
- Former Grant, Locust, and Cavite Housing Areas - Soils and building-related materials contaminated with VOCs or pesticides (approx. 2,290 tons of soil and 1,240 tons of concrete excavated).

The ROD also required long-term monitoring of landfill leachate, methane gas and adjacent groundwaterICs (i.e. deed restrictions) prohibiting residential use of the DCL and DCL Contributor Sitesment. Because the 2015 Devens FYR inadvertently omitted the DCL Contributor SitesArmy was required to prepare and submit a 2015 FYR Addendum to evaluate/ensure continued effectiveness of the 1995 remedy (i.e. ICs) for these sites. In June 2019, Army submitted the "2015 FYR Addendum for the DCL Contributor Sites" for EPA review and comment. While enforcement and monitoring of ICs were deemed effective in providing short-term protection of human health and the environment, additional work to assess the remedy's ability to provide protection in the long-term.

In response to concerns raised in the 2020 FYR Report, a Memorandum for the Record is being prepared to incorporate the existing deed restrictions prohibiting residential use into the selected remedy under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), and requiring inspection in all future FYRs. The deed restrictions will be included in annual long term monitoring reports and described in a site-specific Land Use Control (LUC) Implementation Plan (LUCIP) that will include the DCL and three DCL Contributor Sites AOC 9, AOC 40 and SA 13. Because this is considered a minor change to the 1999 ROD, an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) is not required. However, to maintain transparency and to adhere to the core values of including the public in all CERCLA decision-making processes, the Final Memorandum for the Record and an accompanying Fact Sheet, will be presented to the public for review and comment and will be placed in the Administrative Record for the site.  
.

**AOCs 25, 26, 27 and 41 - South Post Impact Area (SPIA)**  
SPIA is located within the 4,800-acre area known as the South Post of the former Fort Devens and is currently used by Army, the Massachusetts National Guard, and law enforcement agencies for active weapons and ordnance discharge training. The 964-acre "SPIA-monitored area" includes the following AOCs:

- AOC 25 - Former explosives ordnance discharge range (closed in 1996);
- AOC 26 - Zulu Range (explosive ordnance discharge and grenade training);
- AOC 27 - Hotel Range (small arms training); and,
- AOC 41 - Former landfill (non-explosive military and household debris).

A ROD for the SPIA-monitoring area in July 1996. While the ROD documented a “No Action” remedy for SPIA-monitored area groundwater, surface water, soil, and sediment, it included the following components to ensure protection of human health and the environment: groundwater monitoring for potential contaminant migration out of the SPIA-monitored area, long-term groundwater monitoring at the individual AOCs, sampling of Well D-1 (classified as a transient non-community supply well), development of an Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan (INRMP) (to monitor potential ecological impacts associated with continued use of the site for military training purposes), land-use restrictions (to prohibit installation of drinking water wells in the SPIA-monitored area) and FYRs.

**AOCs 44 and 52 - Barnum Road Maintenance Yards**  
These AOCs consist of four former vehicle maintenance yards totaling approximately 8.8 acres in the northeast corner of the former Fort Devens Main Post.

Prior to base closure, AOC 44 was known as the Cannibalization Yard, where vehicles were stored before being dismantled for usable parts. AOC 52, historically known as the TDA Maintenance Yard, was where vehicles were stored while awaiting repairs.

A ROD signed in March 1995 required excavation of the top two feet of soil from across the site and two known release areas, treatment of soils exceeding site PAH and TPH cleanup levels by cold mix asphalt batching, application of a pavement-wearing course for vehicle-parking surface, expansion of the existing storm water collection system, groundwater monitoring, deed restrictions (prohibiting future residential use) and development and implementation of soil management practices to minimize potential exposure to contaminated subsurface soils.

In 1995, over 30,000 cubic yards of soil were sampled and excavated, 11,800 cubic yards of which were treated by cold mix asphalt batching and backfilled/compacted with the uncontaminated excavated soils as a sub-base material in the excavation. Four inches of bituminous pavement was placed over the sub-based material as a pavement wearing course for Army vehicle parking. The existing stormwater drainage system was expanded to collect storm water from the newly paved surface and a detention pond was constructed to store accumulated rainfall and minimize flow at the outfall of Cold Spring Brook during heavy storm events.

The groundwater underlying the Maintenance Yards is classified by the MassDEP as a source of potable water supply. Based on a 1992 SI water level survey, inferred groundwater flow from the Maintenance Yards is northeast towards the Town of Ayer's Grove Pond water supply wells. Three rounds of groundwater monitoring were performed at two monitoring wells, G3M-93-10X and G3M-93-11X, in 1998, 1999 and 2003. No significant contamination was detected supporting the conclusion that surface soil contaminants at the Cannibalization Yard had not affected the aquifer. Based on these results, additional monitoring wells were not required.

A Remedial Action Completion Report (RACR) was issued in 1996 confirming successful implementation of remedy components and attainment of response actions objectives set forth in the ROD. Because ICs (i.e. deed restrictions prohibiting residential reuse of the site and access to site groundwater for residential or commercial purposes) and soil management practices (for construction-related activities) are components of the selected remedy, FYRs are required.

The property was retained by Army and is the current site of the Armed Forces Reserve Center complex, constructed in 2010. The complex includes a large training building and a U.S. Army Reserve and U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Organizational Maintenance Shop/Area Maintenance Support Activities building.

To address concerns raised in the 2020 FYR Report, a site-specific LUCIP will be prepared to clearly identify requirements for the effective implementation, monitoring and enforcement of the ROD-required LUCs/ICs and items to be evaluated during annual LUC inspections conducted in conjunction with the Annual Main Post LTM activities.

**AOCs 32 and 43A - Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office Yard**  
AOC 32, known as the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office Yard (DRMO), was an active materials storage facility from approximately 1964 to 1995 consisting of three fenced areas where various materials were processed and stored, and a former waste oil underground storage tank (UST). The UST tank was removed in 1992 and associated contaminated soils were excavated and disposed of off-site. The selected remedy in the 1998 ROD was excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soils and debris and monitored natural attenuation (MNA) for groundwater.

AOC 43A, known as the POL (petroleum, oil and lubricants) Storage Area served as the central distribution point for all gasoline stations at Fort Devens during the 1940s and 1950s, and was subsequently used to store fuels for various purposes. The distribution facility consisted of a main gasoline station, a pump house, four 12,000-gallon USTs, one 10,000-gallon UST, two 12,000-gallon above-ground storage tanks (ASTs), and two 8,000-gallon ASTs. Gasoline was delivered by rail car and transferred to the tanks. The selected remedy in the 1998 ROD was MNA to address groundwater contamination.

Groundwater sampling results following the injection and subsequent LTM data indicates a significant decline in contaminants of concern. LTM and performance monitoring is ongoing.

Institutional controls prohibiting groundwater use, were specified in the May 2000, Finding of Suitability to Transfer (FOST) and incorporated into the deed prior to property transfer.

**AOCs 43G and 43J - Historic Gas Station**  
AOCs 43G and 43J are located in the central portion of the former Main Post of Fort Devens. AOC 43G consists of the former Army Air Force Exchange Service gas station and historic Gas Station G. Motor pool operations were halted during the late 1940s or early 1950s. The AOC 43J property was transferred from the Army to MassDevelopment in 2006. A June 2006, Grant of Environmental Restriction and Easement (GERE) was issued by MassDEP and recorded by MassDevelopment with the appropriate Registry of Deeds. The selected remedy in the 1996 ROD for both AOCs included intrinsic bioremediation, supplemental data collection, groundwater modeling, and long-term groundwater monitoring.

To address concerns raised in the 2020 FYR Report, a supplemental remedial investigation will be performed at AOC 43G to define the current nature and extent of site contaminants and update the existing long-term groundwater monitoring program, if warranted.

**Former Elementary School Spill Site (AOC 69W)**  
AOC 69W is located at the northeast corner of the intersection of Jackson Road and Antietam Street on the northern portion of the former Fort Devens Main Post. AOC 69W is composed of the former Devens Elementary School (Building 215) and its associated parking lot and adjacent lawn extending approximately 300 feet northwest to Willow Brook. (The former Fort Devens Elementary School reopened in 2000 as the Parker Charter School.) Contamination at AOC 69W is attributed to two separate releases of No. 2 heating oil in 1972 and 1978. It is estimated that 7,000 to 8,000 gallons of No. 2 heating oil were released into soil from each release.

In the late 1990s, the Army performed a removal action, excavating approximately 3,500 cys of petroleum-contaminated soil associated with the 1972 fuel oil leak. An additional 10,000-gallon fuel oil UST and associated equipment were also removed. Soil sampling indicated petroleum-related contaminants immediately adjacent to the school. Because of the proximity of the school, this soil could not be excavated without potential building structural damage.

The selected remedy in the 1999 Limited Action ROD included groundwater long-term monitoring and institutional controls to limit the potential exposure to contaminated soils and groundwater.

The Army finalized a Finding of Suitability to Transfer for AOC 69W in 2006 and the property was transferred from Army ownership to MassDevelopment in August 2007.

To address concerns raised in the 2020 FYR Report, a supplemental remedial investigation will be performed to define the current nature and extent of site contaminants and update the existing long-term groundwater monitoring program, if warranted. In addition, a site-specific LUCIP is being prepared to identify requirements for the effective implementation, monitoring, and enforcement of ROD-required LUCs/ICs and items to be evaluated during annual LUC inspections conducted in conjunction with Annual Main Post LTM activities.

**Former Moore Army Air Field (AOC 50)**  
AOC 50 is located on the northeastern boundary of the former Moore Army Airfield within the former Fort Devens North Post and is currently defined as three distinct areas: the Source Area, Southwest Plume and North Plume. The Source Area is comprised of less than two-acre areas and includes historic sources of contamination such as two World War II fueling systems, a dry well formerly connected to a parachute shakeout tower, and the former Drum Storage Area. The primary area of groundwater contamination at AOC 50 is referred to as the Southwest Plume, which is divided into five areas that extend from the Source Area approximately 3,000 feet towards the Nashua River. The North Plume refers to the portion of groundwater contamination that flows north from Area 1, off Army property, during drought conditions.

The selected remedy in the 2004 ROD included the following components:  
• SVE in the Source Area;  
• ERD throughout the site;  
• IWS along the downgradient portion of the Southwest Plume;  
• Contingency for chemical oxidation in the North Plume;  
• Contingency for evaluation and manipulation of aquifer chemistry for re-precipitation of solubilized inorganics associated with the ERD process;  
• Long Term Monitoring;  
• Institutional Controls (ICs) or Land Use Controls (LUCs) (prevent construction of structures, groundwater withdrawal for any purpose, and storm water discharge/recharge); and,  
• Five Year Reviews.

Since remedy implementation in 2004, the PCE plume has decreased in size (15.5 acres in 2004 to 6.81 acres in 2018) and concentration (max. concentration 14,000 ug/L in 2004 to 370 ug/L in 2018). The ROD estimated that cleanup goals consistent with unrestricted land use and potable use of groundwater for the entire site would be achieved in 27 years.

Army transferred all but 14 acres of the former airfield to MassDevelopment for "Special Use II" and "Innovation and Technology Business" purposes. The area retained by Army was renamed Devens Reserve Forces Training Area (DRFTA) and is used for reserve forces training. The former airfield is closed to aircraft traffic and is currently leased by MassDevelopment to the Massachusetts State Police for training and vehicle storage. The Merrimack Warehouse Realty Co., Inc. owns the area overlying the North Plume. The property is zoned commercial and is developed with a building used for the manufacture of windshield washer fluid and as a storage facility. A fire pond is located on the property. The portion of the property located along the Nashua River is owned by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.

**Building 3713 Fuel Oil Spill Site (AOC 57)**  
AOC 57 is located between Barnum Road and Cold Spring Brook on the northeast side of what was formerly the Main Post of Fort Devens in the town of Harvard, Massachusetts. AOC 57 lies within a Commonwealth of Massachusetts Zone II aquifer protection area for the Town of Ayer Grove Pond public water supply wells. The portion of the former Devens site that includes AOC 57 was used primarily as a storage and maintenance area for military vehicles. AOC 57 consists of three sub-areas (Area 1, Area 2, and Area 3) that are located south to southeast of Building 3713 and former Buildings 3756, 3757, and 3758. The sub-areas received storm water runoff and waste from vehicle maintenance at former vehicle storage yards.

A "No Further Action" ROD was completed for Area 1 following removal of contaminated soil in 1997. In June 2000, the Army completed a RI in Areas 2 and 3 that revealed residual contamination from a removal action conducted in 1994. A ROD for Areas 2 and 3 was issued in September 2001 that required excavation, groundwater monitoring, surface water monitoring, and institutional controls (prohibiting use of groundwater as a potable source and residential use of floodplain property). A 2004 ESD modified the remedy by including petroleum-related contaminants and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as contaminants of concern and increasing the volume and cost for soil removal activities.

A final Interim Remedial Action Completion Report (RACR) was prepared in September 2004 summarizing the work performed to complete remediation of contaminated soils. Long-term monitoring of groundwater, surface monitoring and ICs continues in accordance with the ROD.

To address concerns raised in the 2020 FYR Report, a supplemental remedial investigation will be performed to define the current nature and extent of site contaminants and update the existing long-term groundwater monitoring program, if warranted. In addition, a site-specific LUCIP is being prepared to identify requirements for the effective implementation, monitoring, and enforcement of ROD-required LUCs/ICs and items to be evaluated during annual LUC inspections conducted in conjunction with Annual Main Post LTM activities.

**Grant, Oak and Maple Housing Areas (HAs) and 37 MM Impact Area**  
The former housing areas, including Grant, Oak and Maple Housing Areas and the 37-mm Impact Area (IA), occupied approximately 154 acres in the eastern portion of the former Fort Devens Main Post.

In 1995, a facility-wide archival search was conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to document the locations of all known training areas and ranges at Fort Devens. The report identified a former training range, later determined to be a 37-mm anti-tank range near the former Oak and Maple Housing Areas. A munitions investigation was performed in 1995 near the housing areas that uncovered a number of items. A removal action was performed in 1996.

In 2002, the Army conducted a pesticide soil remedial action within the Grant Housing Area. The action resulted in the excavation and disposal of more than 150,000 tons of contaminated soil and concrete from the housing area.

From 2002 through 2005, a Time Critical Removal Action (TCRA) was conducted in the southeast portion of the Grant Housing Area to address an unknown source release of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to soil. The area excavated also included a portion of the former range IA-5. A total of approximately 12,000 tons of soil was excavated and disposed as part of the removal action.

From 2004 to 2005, assessments were conducted within the Grant Housing Area and the Oak and Maple Housing Areas to determine if military activities resulted in the release of Munitions Constituents to soil and groundwater. The selected remedy in the 2009 ROD for the Grant Housing Area and the 37-mm Impact Area required implementation of land use controls (LUCs) including: (1) public education to property owners, residents, as well as any construction and/or utility contractors conducting ground intrusive activities on the property; and (2) that a deed notice be inserted by MassDevelopment into any deeds stating that there is no evidence of additional UXO present at the site, but that the possibility does remain that UXO could be discovered in the future. On an annual basis, the Army will also conduct annual reviews to confirm the overall effectiveness and compliance with the established LUCs.

Additionally, the LUCs for the Impact Area include: (1) institutional controls to be implemented through a Grant of Environmental Restrictions and Easements; (2) access controls to be implemented by the use of signage and fencing to restrict public access; (3) public education to property owners, residents, as well as any construction and/or utility contractors conducting ground intrusive activities on the property; (4) prohibitive directives to include restrictions on all ground intrusive activities; and (5) annual site inspections to evaluate the access controls, monitor the potential presence of surficial unexploded ordnance, and evaluate the overall effectiveness of the LUCs.

A 2014 Explanation of Significant Differences incorporated the Oak and Maple Housing Areas within the 2009 ROD, including LUCs for these areas to prevent direct contact with munitions that may remain in soil.

The LUCs are in place at the former Grant Housing Area and the 37mm Impact Area. Although the LUCs have not been formally implemented at the Oak and Maple Housing Areas, they continue to be enforced pending regulatory approval of the Land Use Control Implementation Plan (LUCIP) Addendum and site-specific Soil Management Plan (SMP) for these areas.

Since 1996, the Housing Areas and 37-mm Impact Area are under MassDevelopment ownership. The Grant, Oak and Maple areas are open space with ground covering consisting of bare soils, woodland, and unmaintained lawns. Former infrastructure, including roadways and utilities, remain in place. The Grant HA is described in the Devens Reuse Plan as being zoned for residential use whereas the Maple, Oak and 37-mm Impact Area are described as Innovation and Technology Business areas.

Although the former HAs and 37-mm IA were inadvertently omitted from the September 2015 FYR Review, Army submitted a 2015 FYR Addendum for these area in September 2016. Due to the unexpected length of time it's taken to finalize the LUCIP Addendum and SMP, Army will prepare and issue a revised, draft FYR Addendum that deems the remedy "Short Term Protective."

### What Is the Current Site Status?

To date, about 1,080 acres have been transferred to other federal agencies and almost 3,000 acres have been transferred to MassDevelopment, the Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA). Only 150 acres remain as leased parcels that will be transferred as cleanup activities are completed. The SHL and former Railroad Roundhouse sites are both located within Parcel A.1, property retained by Army and leased to MassDevelopment under a Lease in Furtherance of Conveyance (LIFOC). Upon determination by EPA that the SHL remedy is Operating Properly and Successfully (OPS), a Finding of Suitability to Transfer (FOST) will be executed and ownership of both properties can be permanently conveyed to the LRA for final reuse/redevelopment.

In response to EPA comments on the 2015 Devens Five Year Review (FYR), Army performed an Expedited Site Investigation (ESI) in 2016 to evaluate the possible presence of emerging contaminants known as poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), specifically two PFAS -- perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) -- at the former Fort Devens. The ESI also included sampling of Devens and nearby municipal water supply wells. Based on initial data collected, Army, MassDevelopment, MassDEP, and EPA agreed that a more comprehensive. site-wide investigation was warranted. In 2018, Army commenced a site-wide PFAS Remedial Investigation (RI) that included collection of soil, groundwater, surface water, sediment samples and municipal water supply well samples to identify possible source areas and delineate the full extent of PFOA/PFOS contamination within and beyond former base boundaries.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).
