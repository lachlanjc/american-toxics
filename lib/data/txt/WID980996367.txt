### Background

The Sheboygan Harbor and River site includes the lower 14 miles of the river from the Sheboygan Falls Dam downstream to, and including, the inner harbor. This segment of the river flows through Sheboygan Falls, Kohler and Sheboygan before entering Lake Michigan. The former Tecumseh Products Co. plant in Sheboygan Falls is located on the upper river and is considered the primary source of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination to river sediment.

In 1977, the state of Wisconsin detected PCBs during routine sampling of fish. Since then, PCBs have been detected in fish, wildlife, surface water, sediment in the harbor and river, and in floodplain soil. The highest concentrations of PCBs were detected in sediment immediately downstream from a die-casting plant in Sheboygan Falls, with concentrations declining farther downstream from the plant.

EPA added the site to its National Priorities List in 1986.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Cleanup of the upper, middle and lower portions of the Sheboygan River is done. More than 86,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediment were dredged from the river and inner harbor and then temporarily stored in large geotextile "tubes." Water was squeezed out of the tubes with the remaining sediment taken to a licensed landfill for proper disposal.

The cleanup also included the limited removal of PCB-contaminated soil and the construction of a groundwater intercept trench at the former Tecumseh Products facility in Sheboygan Falls. PCB-contaminated soil from affected floodplain areas along the river was also cleaned up.

Although the cleanup of the river and inner harbor was completed in 2013, Pollution Risk Services (PRS), the company determined responsible for the contamination, continues to monitor the recovery of the river system.

The third five-year review (August 2020) noted that additional sampling needed to be done at the former Tecumseh Products property in Sheboygan Falls to further identify PCB contamination found there in 2016 and 2018. In addition, the report noted that an area of sediment in the upper river needed to be re-sampled to determine if more sediment needed to be removed. EPA worked with PRS to conduct these actions.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is conducting its fourth five-year review of the Sheboygan Harbor & River Superfund Site, located in Sheboygan County, Wisconsin. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up - with waste managed on-site - to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. A summary of the cleanup activities and an evaluation of the protectiveness of the implemented cleanup remedies will be included in the five-year review report.

Cleanup actions at the site included:

- dredging and removing contaminated sediment from the river and inner harbor.
- removing soil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from the former Tecumseh Products facility in Sheboygan Falls and affected floodplain areas along the river.

During the five-year review, EPA will be conducting a site inspection, reviewing the status of the cleanup, and conducting a review of the current data. The review is expected to be completed by August 21, 2025. The results of the review and the report will be posted on this webpage. The **previous five-year review** noted that additional sampling needed to be done at the former Tecumseh Products property in Sheboygan Falls to further identify PCB contamination found there in 2016 and 2018. In addition, the report noted that an area of sediment in the upper river needed to be re-sampled to determine if more sediment needed to be removed. EPA worked with PRS to conduct these actions.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Sediment is contaminated with PCBs and a wide variety of heavy metals. Soil and surface water are contaminated with PCBs and heavy metals, including arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, and zinc.
