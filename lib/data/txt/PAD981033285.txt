### Background

The 1.8-acre Rodale Manufacturing Co., Inc. site is located in Emmaus, Pennsylvania. From the 1950s to 1975, Rodale Manufacturing manufactured wiring devices and electrical connectors on-site. Square D conducted similar operations from 1975 to 1986. The disposal of electroplating waste and rinse water into on-site wells contaminated groundwater with hazardous chemicals. The site was added to the Superfund program's National Priority List (NPL) in October 1991. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s long-term remedy, selected in the [September 1999 Record of Decision (ROD) (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/161756), included continuation of a pump-and-treat system to contain the contaminated groundwater plume. The remedy also requires monitoring of the groundwater plume outside of the pump-and-treat system capture zone.

Due to the presence of dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) in the groundwater, it is recognized that the restoration of groundwater will not be achieve in a timely matter and for that reason a Technical Impracticability Waiver is in place. The applicable and relevant and appropriate requirements noted in the ROD relating to trichloroethene (TCE) in groundwater and perchloroethene in the subsurface soils have been waived due to the DNAPL zone.

The remedy also required land use restrictions on the property; and groundwater use restrictions throughout the entire plume.

Construction of the remedy was completed in September 2003.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s potentially responsible party (PRP), Square D, conducts operation and maintenance activities under EPA oversight.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent, [2023 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2355169), concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. The remedy will be effective in the long term if pilot modifications to the pump-and-treat system are deemed successful or when, if necessary, alternative appropriate modifications to the pump-and-treat system are made to ensure that the treatment system effectively meets all performance standards. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2028.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Institutional controls are in place to prevent grondwater use. Additional information about the institutional controls are available in the [2023 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2355169) (pages 9-10 and Appendix C).

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1981, site operators removed wastes from three on-site disposal wells and disposed of the wastes in federally approved hazardous waste facilities. TCE contamination, a chemical component of solvents, had been a continuous problem in the Borough of Emmaus, with varying levels of TCE detected in seven wells of the Emmaus Municipal Water Works since 1981. The Borough closed Well No. 5 in 1981 and later abandoned it in 1988 due to constant TCE contamination. In 1990, the Borough installed air strippers in three of its supply wells. In 1997, the potentially responsible party constructed a groundwater pump-and-treat system to limit migration of contamination from the site due to the detection of contamination in some off-site private wells.
