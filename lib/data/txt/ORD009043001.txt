### Background

The 2.5-acre United Chrome Products, Inc. site is a former chrome-plating facility in an industrial complex next to Corvallis Municipal Airport near Corvallis, Oregon. The company conducted electroplating operations from 1956 to 1985. Plating wastes were discharged into a dry well. The indoor plating tanks leaked plating solution directly to subsurface soils. Groundwater, surface water, sediments and on-site soils were contaminated with chromium.

EPA listed the site on the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in 1984. In 1985, EPA removed chrome-contaminated liquids and disposed of hazardous waste off site. Some contamination remains in groundwater in an isolated area of the site. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

EPA completed the fifth Five-Year Review of the site’s remedy in 2017. It concluded that the remedy currently protects human health and the environment. Soils have been cleaned up to levels protective of industrial use and appropriate institutional controls are in place to prohibit non-industrial use. The groundwater extraction and treatment system continue to pump contaminated groundwater to the City of Corvallis’ wastewater treatment facility. The City also implemented a deed restriction and Easement and Equitable Servitudes (EES) to limit groundwater use and establish a groundwater exclusion zone.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA selected the site’s long-term remedy in 1986. It included groundwater extraction and treatment and demolition of buildings. Construction of the remedy took place in 1988. In 1991, EPA updated the remedy, modifying groundwater cleanup levels and including off-site treatment of extracted groundwater by the publicly owned treatment works. Groundwater extraction ceased in December 2004. Groundwater monitoring will continue in both the upper zone and lower aquifer to identify any changes or increasing trends in concentrations.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. EPA conducted a short-term action in 1985 to remove chrome-contaminated liquids and hazardous waste for off-site disposal. In 2000, the City of Corvallis completed a soil removal action, removing chromium-contaminated soil for disposal at a permitted hazardous waste landfill.
