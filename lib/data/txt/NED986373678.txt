### Background

The Iowa-Nebraska Light & Power Co. site is a former manufactured gas plant located in Norfolk, Madison County, Nebraska. The site is located in the downtown area at the intersection of 7 <sup><span>th</span></sup> Street and Norfolk Avenue. An eastern and northeastern portion of the site is currently owned by Black Hills/Nebraska Gas Utility Company LLC. The remainder of the site is owned by Nebraska Public Power District. The site is approximately two acres in size. Waste products from the manufactured gas process are present in soil and groundwater at the site. The site is currently used as a concrete parking lot on the Black Hills portion and a fenced gravel lot on the Nebraska Public Power District portion. The site is located one-half mile upgradient of the east municipal well field which supplies drinking water to the city of Norfolk. Groundwater flow in the site area is to the east, migrating toward the east municipal well field. The site was proposed for inclusion to the National Priorities List (NPL) in September 2015 and was officially listed on the NPL in April 2016.

The site was separated into two operable units (OUs) to support a phased remedial approach. OU1 is designated as source materials (remaining soil contamination and dense non-aqueous phase liquid) and OU2 is designated as sitewide groundwater. This phased remedial approach will result in addressing the source materials initially to prevent the continued leaching of contaminants into the groundwater. This is the preferred remedial approach since the remaining source area contamination needs to be addressed before fully evaluating groundwater remedial alternatives and selecting the long-term remedial action to restore the aquifer to beneficial use (i.e., drinking water use).

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The EPA conducted an Expanded Site Investigation in 2001. The objectives of the ESI were to verify the presence of residual contamination from the coal gasification processes remaining at the site; to characterize any sources of contamination identified; and to determine whether groundwater in the area of the site is contaminated. This investigation included installation of monitoring wells and numerous soil probes/borings and the sampling and analysis of soil, groundwater and storm sewer samples. Based on the investigation, the main source of soil and groundwater contamination was determined to be the 10,000 cubic foot belowground gas holder.

In 2007, the EPA began an Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis, which included additional investigation activities to better define and characterize the subsurface geology and site hydrogeology and the extent of soil, dense non-aqueous phase liquid and dissolved-phase groundwater contamination at the site. The EE/CA resulted in the completion of a non-time critical removal action in 2014. The removal action consisted of building demolition and excavation and disposal of approximately 10,495 tons of contaminated material. The site was restored with a concrete parking lot on the Black Hills portion and a fenced gravel lot on the Nebraska Public Power District portion.

The site is being addressed through federal actions and was officially placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in April 2016. The EPA and the respondents entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent to conduct the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study in May 2017. The main objective of the RI/FS was to evaluate the nature and extent of the groundwater plume impacted by the former manufactured gas plant site and to gather data to support the development and evaluation of remedial alternatives. In 2018, investigation activities consisted of collecting additional groundwater samples from multiple locations and depths to further define the contaminant plume. In 2019, additional groundwater monitoring wells were installed throughout the site to monitor the contaminant plume. In 2021, the RI Report was finalized and the FS for OU1 was conducted to evaluate remedial alternatives to address the remaining source materials at the site.

On May 3, 2022, the EPA held a public meeting to present the remedial action alternatives evaluated to address the OU1 source materials associated with the site. The public comment period ended on May 24, 2022. The EPA issued the Record of Decision for OU1 at the site on September 26, 2022. The selected remedy to address the source materials is In Situ Thermal Treatment. ISTT involves heating the subsurface to volatilize contaminants for vapor removal from the subsurface. The heat vaporizes volatile organic contaminants and reduces the viscosity of the dense non-aqueous phase liquid so it moves more easily through soil for collection. The selected remedy is estimated to cost $7,900,000.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Current Status (OU1)

On January 27, 2025, the EPA and the respondents entered into a Consent Decree to perform the remedial design/remedial action of the OU1 remedy. The Remedial Design phase of the remedy is planned to be completed in 2027.

Current Status (OU2)

The EPA and the respondents entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent to conduct the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study in May 2017. RI/FS work plans have been submitted and approved. In 2018, investigation activities consisted of collecting additional groundwater samples from multiple locations and depths to further define the contaminant plume. In 2019, additional groundwater monitoring wells were installed throughout the site to monitor the contaminant plume. The main objective of the RI/FS is to evaluate the nature and extent of the groundwater plume impacted by the former manufactured gas plant site and to gather data to support the development and evaluation of remedial alternatives. Evaluation of the groundwater plume and data gathering related to the RI/FS is ongoing.

Following completion of the remedial design/remedial action for OU1 remedy and finalization of the RI/FS report for OU2, the EPA will issue a Record of Decision for the OU2 remedy.
