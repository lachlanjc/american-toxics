### Background

The Virgin Island Chemical Superfund site is located in south-central St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The 3.5-acre area was leased to various chemical manufacturers. The facility manufactured pharmaceutical chemicals, primarily phenacetin, ethoxyquin and quinidine. Virgin Islands Chemical Company (VICC) produced benzyl acetate, which is used in perfumes, flavorings, resin, lacquers, printing inks and varnish removers. In 1985, VICC also began producing benzyl salicylate, which is used as a perfume fixative and as a solvent for synthetic musk, and is an ingredient in sunscreen lotion.

Following immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, including the demolition and removal of all buildings from the site and placement of a chain-link fence around the site to secure the area, EPA put the site’s long-term remedy in place. After implementation of the remedy, EPA issued the site’s Preliminary Close-out Report in March 2004. All post-remedial monitoring has been completed and the Site was deleted from the National Priorities List (NPL) in 2009.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Immediate Actions: In January and February 1989, EPA conducted a preliminary assessment and removal evaluation at the site. The laboratory/warehouse buildings contained about 400 drums, some extremely deteriorated, leaking cylinders of chlorine and hydrogen chloride, and over 800 containers of laboratory reagents that included sodium metal, potassium cyanide and ethyl ether. EPA removed several hundred 55-gallon, 85-gallon and 5-gallon drums of various chemicals, and 8,061 pounds of lab pack chemicals from the laboratory/warehouse buildings.

Long-term Cleanup: Following a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the nature and extent of contamination at the site that was completed in the fall of 2001, EPA selected a remedy to address the site’s source areas in an August 2002 Record of Decision, or ROD. The remedy included the installation of a soil vapor extraction/air sparging (SVE/AS) system for the Aboveground Storage Tanks area to treat soil and groundwater, and monitored natural attenuation for the Former Process Pit area.

Following implementation of the remedy, EPA issued the site’s Preliminary Close-out Report in March 2004. All post-remedial monitoring has been completed and the Site was deleted from the NPL in 2009. The Site property was sold in March of 2020 and the property is back into reuse.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site has been addressed in two stages: immediate actions and a long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.

Immediate actions such as the removal of leaking contaminated drums have reduced the risk posed to the health and safety of the nearby population while additional site investigations were being conducted. All post-remedial monitoring is completed. This Site was deleted from the NPL in October 2009. The Site property was sold in March of 2020 and the Site is back in reuse.

### Enforcement Information

On March 23, 2020, the land that makes up the Site was sold, allowing the Site property to immediately go back into productive reuse by a St. Croix construction company. As part of the sale, EPA received over $124,000, as required by a 2003 the Consent Decree (CD) with the owner/potentially responsible party (PRP), CHS Holding Corp. (CHS). Pursuant to the terms of the CD, CHS agreed to market and sell the Site property and transfer the net proceeds of the sale to the U.S. While CHS initially complied with the CD, it stopped complying. EPA was pursuing enforcement of the CD, when in November 2019, it was contacted by the purchaser. EPA moved quickly to approve the terms of sale and provided the purchaser with both a Comfort Letter and a Release of Notice of Federal Lien.
