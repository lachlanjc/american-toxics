### Background

The PJP Landfill Superfund site is an inactive landfill located on approximately 87 acres in an industrial area in Jersey City, Hudson County, New Jersey. It borders the Hackensack River on the north and west; Truck Routes 1 and 9 to the northeast; and various light industries along the other borders. The Sip Avenue Ditch, a tidal creek through the site, carries run-off from the PJP Landfill and the Jersey City stormwater/sewer system to the Hackensack River. The site was originally a salt meadow, a grassy area subject to flooding by salt water, a portion of which was condemned in 1932 for the construction of the elevated Pulaski Skyway that passes over a portion of the site and has supports located on the site.

From about 1970 to 1974, the PJP Landfill Company operated a commercial landfill at the site, accepting chemical and industrial waste. In 1977, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, or NJDEP, ordered the PJP Landfill Company to properly cover and grade the landfill, and to remove wastes in contact with the Hackensack River and the Sip Avenue Ditch. However, the company did not comply with the order.

From its 1970 beginnings through 1985, frequent accidental underground fires burned waste from buried drums and decomposing landfill material on a 45-acre portion of the landfill under the skyway. The landfill operations contaminated the soil, sediment, surface water and, groundwater with hazardous chemicals, including [volatile and semi-volatile compounds](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/technical-overview-volatile-organic-compounds), [petroleum hydrocarbons](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts123.pdf), and [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts69.pdf), all potentially harmful contaminants that easily evaporate in the air and can migrate from the soil into the groundwater. The landfill also contained a variety of metals. To ensure the contamination was controlled and cleaned up, the EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983. The NJDEP is the lead agency for cleanup actions at this site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The EPA addressed the site in two stages: short-term actions on a portion of the site and a long-term sitewide cleanup.

**Short-term Actions:** The NJDEP extinguished landfill fires and removed buried drums and heavily contaminated soil for offsite disposal in 1985 and 1986. NJDEP installed a fire break trench to prevent the spread of underground fires if they occurred again, and regraded, capped, and reseeded 45 acres. Capping involves placing a cover over contaminated material, such as landfill waste or contaminated soil, that is left in place. Such covers are called “caps”. They isolate and contain the contaminated material to avoid the spread of contamination. In addition, the NJDEP installed a gas venting system to prevent the buildup of methane and other gases in the landfill. No fires have occurred since then.

**Long-term Cleanup:** Following thorough investigations of the site and evaluations of cleanup alternatives, the EPA selected a cleanup plan for the site in a 1995 Record of Decision, or ROD, to remove all remaining buried drums, cap the remaining landfill area, conduct quarterly site inspections, put institutional controls in place (e.g., deed restrictions on future land use), and monitor leachate and groundwater. Leachate is the wastewater formed primarily when rainwater or snow melt filters through wastes in a landfill; when this liquid comes in contact with buried wastes, it can leach, or draw out, chemicals or constituents from those wastes. Because contamination levels in some areas of the groundwater are above certain standards, the NJDEP set a [Classification Exemption Area/Well Restriction Area](https://gisdata-njdep.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/njdep::classification-exception-areas-well-restriction-areas-for-new-jersey/explore?location=40.735396%2C-74.086246%2C17.03) for the site, which defines an area in which the use of groundwater wells is prohibited. CWM Chemical Services, L.L.C. and Waste Management of New Jersey, potentially responsible parties, or PRPs, collectively referred to as CCS, completed the long-term cleanup and construction of the final landfill cap over the remaining 37 acres in 2012. PRPs, are individuals or companies that may have owned or operated the site; generated waste that was disposed of or released on the site; or may, in some way be responsible for causing or contributing to the contamination.

An approximately 1.5-acre area along Routes 1 and 9 that contained a Truck Stop and other light industries was within the boundaries of the PJP Landfill site. However, the EPA determined that it was neither part of nor contributed to the landfill waste. Therefore, the EPA and the NJDEP no longer consider the Truck Stop Area part of the Superfund site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In March 2008, AMB Corporation (now Prologis) purchased the majority of the site (52 acres) on which they completed construction and began operating in 2016. A commercial trucking company expanded their adjacent facility to include three acres of the capped landfill. The New Jersey Department of Transportation owns the portion of the site under the Pulaski Skyway and Jersey City owns the remaining 32 acres for a planned park and nature center.

Prologis and Jersey City sample groundwater, sediment, and surface water (Hackensack River and Sip Avenue Ditch) quarterly. They also inspect vegetation on the landfill cover, in the Sip Avenue Ditch, and in wetland areas quarterly. A gas venting system continuously collects landfill gas and treats it before it is released to the air.

In addition to ongoing coordination with the NJDEP on operation, maintenance, and monitoring activities, the EPA continues to conduct a formal review of the site and all systems every five years, known as a “Five Year Review”. This thorough review uses site inspections, detailed record reviews, and discussions with the state to ensure that the current approach protects people’s health and the environment. The third five-year-review noted evidence that per- and polyfluoroalkyls, or PFAS, and other contaminants are impacting the Hackensack River. The EPA and the NJDEP have requested further information to determine if and to what extent the landfill is impacting the Hackensack River surface water and sediment. PFAS are a group of long-lasting human-made chemicals also known as “forever chemicals”, manufactured and used in a variety of industries. including carpeting, leather and clothing, textiles, paper and packaging, non-stick coatings, rubber and plastics.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Several [institutional controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls) are in place because remaining contaminants in the capped landfill make the site unsuitable for unrestricted use. These controls play an important role in site cleanups because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land use that could disturb the cap and prevent the use of groundwater from the site. The land use is controlled by a deed notice by each property owner or operator, which is a legal agreement that protects public health and the environment by restricting how the property can be used. The prohibition on groundwater use is controlled by the state’s [Classification Exception Area/Well Restriction Area](https://gisdata-njdep.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/njdep::classification-exception-areas-well-restriction-areas-for-new-jersey/explore?location=40.735396%2C-74.086246%2C17.03).
