### Background

The Ellis Property is a 36 acre tract of land located in Evesham and Medford Townships that was previously a dairy farm. Approximately four acres of the 36-acre tract was used for drum reconditioning and storage. The four acre site included a large two-story building that housed several washing tanks and troughs, and three sheds. At the time of the site discovery, 50 to 75 drums and other chemical containers, many of them full, were found in the sheds. An area adjacent to the sheds contained about one hundred 55-gallon plastic drums, most of which contained liquid. Approximately 300 containers were discovered at the site. Many of the drum contents had leaked onto the ground. Surficial spills and discharges associated with drum reconditioning and chemical storage are believed to have contributed to soil and groundwater contamination at the site. Operations ceased in the late 1970s following a fire.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Remediation of contaminated soil was initiated in 1998 by excavating soils that exceeded cleanup levels and transporting contaminated soil off-site for disposal. A total of 1,400 cubic yards of excavated soils were disposed of at a permitted off-site disposal facility. A groundwater pumping treatment system was built on site and started operation in 2000 to address groundwater contaminants.

In 2006, enhancements to improve the performance of the groundwater pumping and treatment system were implemented that included the installation of extraction wells in low-permeability soil formations. In 2012, a cutoff wall was installed to isolate the contaminated groundwater from a sand channel and direct the groundwater to a collection trench.

Starting in 2019, an effort to further expedite the remediation was initiated in two phases. During the first phase, EPA excavated two large areas of soil contamination and disposed of the soil at a permitted off-site facility. In the second phase, EPA utilized a thermal remediation system to heat deep subsurface soil, in place, and remove contamination that is an ongoing source to groundwater contamination.

An environmental monitoring program has been implemented to ensure the effectiveness of the remedy.

Groundwater will continue to be treated and monitored.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Shallow soil excavation and removal was completed in 2020. Thermal treatment of deep soil was completed in 2022. EPA is currently re-commissioning the on-site groundwater treatment system for that will monitor, and treat, groundwater to ensure the effectiveness of these treatments.
