### Background

The Pemaco Maywood site is located in Maywood, California. A chemical mixing facility on site used chlorinated solvents, aromatic solvents and flammable liquids from the late 1940s to 1991. Activities at the site contaminated the soil and groundwater with various contaminants. EPA has completed a number of cleanup actions to protect human health and the environment. Long-term operations and maintenance of the site’s cleanup plan are ongoing with oversight by California’s Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC).

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Multiple actions have been taken to clean up the site. Early actions include removing drums, underground storage tanks and aboveground storage tanks, and operating a soil vapor extraction system. Investigations and studies were also completed to assess the extent of contamination and evaluate remedial alternatives.

Based on the investigations, EPA formally selected the cleanup plan for the site in 2005. The main components of the plan included dual-phase extraction and treatment of groundwater and soil vapor, and electrical resistive heating of areas where soil and groundwater had the highest levels of contamination. Hot spots of soil contamination were removed, and a soil cover was placed over the site and revegetated. Monitored natural attenuation also was selected for certain areas. Natural attenuation is a variety of in-place processes that, under favorable conditions, act without human intervention to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume or concentration of contaminants in groundwater. The cleanup actions overall have removed contaminants and reduced risks to potential exposure.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The groundwater and soil vapor extraction and treatment systems continue to operate at the site. Vapor is treated to meet all air quality standards prior to discharging to ambient air. Treated groundwater and vapor condensate is discharged to the L.A. County Sanitary District sewer system. Groundwater is sampled semi-annually.

EPA transferred lead agency oversight to California’s Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) in 2018. DTSC will manage site monitoring and cleanup activities, including operation of the treatment plant.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Removal actions, or short-term cleanups, included removal of underground storage tanks and several aboveground storage tanks. EPA demolished the facility and a large warehouse, installed fencing, and began investigating the site. Removal activities finished in 1997, and, EPA began construction of a system to treat contaminated soil vapors.
