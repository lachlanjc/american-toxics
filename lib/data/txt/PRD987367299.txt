Background
The Pesticide Warehouse III (PWIII) site is located in Manati , Puerto Rico. The 2-acre area is an inactive pesticide storage facility. It consisted of a main warehouse, a smaller warehouse and a small shed, which contained an on-site well. The facility operated from 1954 to February 2003, when it was relocated. The Puerto Rico Land Authority owned the facility. Site operations included the storage and preparation of pesticides, insecticides, herbicides and fertilizers. Part of the warehouse was also reportedly used for pineapple processing and canning. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in April 2003. In June 2003, a fire consumed the facility. The facility operated from 1954 to February 2003, when it was relocated. The Puerto Rico Land Authority owned the facility.

What Is the Current Site Status?
 EPA developed the requirements the requirements of the contractors for conducting the Remedial Action (RA) for at the Pesticides Warehouse Superfund Site (PWIII) Operable Units (OU) 1 and 2, in accordance with the EPA’s September 2015 Record of Decision (ROD), the September 2019 OU1 (soil) Final Remedial Design (RD) document and the OU2 (groundwater) Final Interim Remedial Design of July 2022. This RA addresses the soil and groundwater contamination at the PWIII site.  The Remedial Action Objectives (RAOs) were developed for the protection of human health (primarily for the future site work and construction worker scenarios) and for the protection of groundwater. These include: 
Mitigation of the potential for inhalation and ingestion exposures to human receptors to pesticides and dioxins/furans in soil resulting in cancer and non-cancer health hazards in excess of EPA’s acceptable risk range.
Minimization of the release of contaminants from the unsaturated soils to groundwater at concentrations that would cause exceedances of the remediation goals (RGs) for groundwater.
Prevention of human exposure to concentrations of site-related contaminants in groundwater above remediation goals (RGs).
Restoration of the groundwater to its most beneficial use as a source of drinking water. 
On July 18, 2023, EPA issued a Request For Offers (RFO) to conduct the work described in the RA SOW. Offers received as a result of this RFO will be evaluated and a contractor will be selected to perform the work.
