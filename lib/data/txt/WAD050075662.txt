### Background

**2019 Explanation of Significant Differences**

In 1985 and 1992, a remedy was selected to remove contaminated soils at the site and treat contaminated groundwater under the site. To ensure continued protection of human health, treatment was also installed at two Lakewood Water District drinking water supply wells. In addition, County Health Department regulations have been adopted to restrict new wells from being drilled in the area of contamination. All residents and businesses in the impacted area currently receive their water from the Lakewood Water District, not private wells.

[The Explanation of Significant Differences, signed on September 3, 2019](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/10/100171741), documents a final decision that recognizes the role that regulatory changes serve to minimize the potential risks from drilling new wells in areas of groundwater contamination.

The Lakewood site, also known as Ponders Corner, is in Lakewood, Washington. The site consists of the former Plaza Cleaners property and groundwater contamination resulting from their historical operations. Prior to 1983, dry cleaning process wastes were dumped into three bottomless septic tanks and on the ground near the facility. These activities contaminated the soil with solvents that moved into the groundwater and extended about 2,000 feet downgradient of Plaza Cleaners.

The Site was listed on the National Priorities List (NPL) on September 8, 1983. In 1984, two air strippers were constructed to treat drinking water from two wells owned by the Lakewood Water District. Since November 1984, all water pumped from those wells continues to be treated prior to use. All residents and businesses in the impacted area receive their water from the Lakewood Water District, not private wells. In addition, local regulations have been adopted to restrict new wells from being drilled in the area of the contamination.

The most heavily contaminated soils and associated sludge were excavated in 1988 and 1989 and disposed off-site. Soil vapor extraction was used to remove the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) remaining in the soils. The soil cleanup was completed in 1992. Site soils were deleted from the NPL in November 1996.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state and federal actions.

The site’s long-term remedy included:

- Treating contaminated groundwater at two wells owned by the Lakewood Water District.
- Excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soils and sludge
- Soil vapor extraction to address remaining soil contaminates
- Public outreach and education

All actions have been implemented and groundwater treatment is ongoing.

In 1984, two air strippers were constructed to treat drinking water from. Since November 1984, all water pumped from those wells has been, and continues to be, treated prior to use. Ecology provides oversight of the treatment.

EPA has conducted six five-year reviews to ensure the remedies protect public health and the environment, and function as intended. The 2017 review concluded that all response actions at the site have been implemented and were protective of human health and the environment. Continued treatment of groundwater prior to use is required for continued protectiveness. In the area of the groundwater contamination, drinking water is supplied via a public water supply system and drilling of new individual wells are restricted.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included treatment of contaminated groundwater, removal and off-site disposal of contaminated soils and sludge; soil vapor extraction to remove contaminates frim soil; and public outreach and education. All actions have been implemented and groundwater treatment is ongoing. Ecology provides oversight of the groundwater treatment.

The Soils Unit was partially deleted from the NPL in November 1996.

EPA is conducting five-year reviews to ensure the remedies protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The 2017 review concluded that response actions at the site have been implemented and were protective of human health and the environment. Continued treatment of groundwater prior to use is required for continued protectiveness. Drilling new individual wells are restricted under local ordinances. Site reviews are conducted every 5 years.
