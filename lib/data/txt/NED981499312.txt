Background
The Cleburn Street Well site consists of the Cleburn Street well and four source areas in Grand Island, Nebraska. The four separate source areas include three dry cleaning facilities, representing Operable Units (OU) 1 to 4, and a former solvents distribution facility, OU5.  The three-dry cleaner source areas include the former One Hour Martinizing facility (OU1 & 2), the Liberty Services facility (OU3) and the Ideal Cleaners of Grand Island facility (OU4). The fifth operable unit, formerly operated by the Nebraska Solvents Company, is the responsibility of the Union Pacific Railroad Company because it is the owner. Union Pacific is performing the work at OU5 under the EPA’s oversight pursuant to a consent decree. Soil and groundwater contaminants in the source areas include trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and petroleum hydrocarbons. Parts of the site have been cleaned up. However, environmental risks remain, and long-term cleanup is ongoing. The EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List on October 14, 1992. For OUs 1-4:  The EPA has been conducting the investigation and cleanup at these areas because no viable potentially responsible parties have been identified to pay for the work. The EPA began extracting contaminated groundwater at the OHM facility in July 1993 under a Removal Action. The EPA continued groundwater extraction and treatment and monitoring as part of the Remedial Action selected in the Record of Decision (ROD) for OUs 1 and 2 in 1996. For OU 5: The Nebraska Solvents Company had operated on property owned by Union Pacific Railroad, which was notified of its potential liability in February 1997. The remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) for OU 5 was completed by UPRR and a final ROD was signed in September 1991. OU5 is located northwest of the intersection of Lincoln Street and the railroad right-of-way on property owned by the UPRR. In 1986, the EPA detected concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in municipal wells in Grand Island. The city of Grand Island subsequently discontinued the use of the wells located at Cleburn, Lincoln and Pine Streets. OU5 consists of two parcels—a west parcel and an east parcel. The west parcel, which was leased by the Nebraska Solvent Company from UPRR from 1936 to 1973, was used for aboveground tank storage and distribution of organic solvents including tetrachloroethene (PCE) for industrial use, primarily in the dry cleaning industry. It is currently unused. The east parcel, which was used as a warehouse for solvent storage and distribution, is currently leased by the city of Grand Island for equipment storage and vehicle maintenance. The east parcel consists of a large maintenance office building and a small sign shop. UPRR, under EPA oversight via a July 1998 Administrative Order on Consent, completed the RI report. The FS was completed in 2000. The selected remedy included a soil vapor extraction (SVE) system for the soil cleanup, an air sparging system for the groundwater cleanup, monitoring of both media, petroleum hydrocarbon removal from the groundwater and an institutional control prohibiting the installation of drinking water wells in the site area via a city ordinance. Construction of the remedial action, which included 18 AS wells and 5 SVE wells, was completed in June 2004. The SVE/AS systems were in operation from June 2004 to November 2007. The systems have performed as expected. In 2005, the contaminants at the east parcel were below the cleanup goals. In 2006, a permanganate injection program to accelerate the degradation of VOCs in the groundwater was approved by the EPA and the NDEQ and implemented by the UPRR. By March 2007, groundwater in the east parcel and all but four monitoring wells in the west parcel had met the cleanup goal of 5 micrograms per liter for PCE and TCE. The groundwater remediation has generally attained cleanup goals outlined in the ROD, however, shallow soils in the west parcel remain a concern. To address the impacted shallow soil and complete the site remediation, UPRR proposed replacing the SVE system with soil excavation and thermal treatment. The EPA determined this change would warrant a ROD amendment, which was signed on March 16, 2009. The AS/SVE wells and treatment system buildings in the east and west parcels were disconnected and abandoned in October 2010. The EPA determined that the wells were no longer effective in the east parcel and disconnections were necessary in order to complete additional work in the west parcel.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site is being addressed through federal, state and PRP actions. The EPA is conducting the work at OUs, 1-4 and the PRP is conducting cleanup work at OU5 under EPA oversight. The EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site, most recently in 2023. These reviews evaluate whether the remedies put in place protect human health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review reached the following conclusions: OU1: Delisted from the National Priorities List OU2:  The OU2 remedy protects human health and the environment in the short term. To address the remaining source area contaminant, a thermal treatment system was installed in Spring 2018 and operated until Fall 2018. Groundwater and indoor air sampling are being performed on a quarterly basis to determine the effectiveness of the thermal treatment system. Sampling has determined that 99.9% of the contamination has been remediated by the thermal system. OU3:  The OU3 remedy protects human health and environment in the short term. The groundwater remedy may need to be reevaluated. OU4: Delisted from the National Priorities List OU5: Vapor intrusion assessment  and mitigation have been conducted and completed by UPRR under EPA oversight. UPRR is also continuing the quarterly monitoring of the west parcel groundwater and soil. The work and contingency plans will continue until the OU5 meets the remedial objectives and goals of the OU5 ROD, as amended.  The protectiveness statement in the 2013 Five-Year Review was deferred until the VI investigation and mitigation was completed.  An addendum was submitted indicating the completion of the assessment in 2015. For OUs 1-4:  Based on the selected remedy in the 2012 ROD Amendment, the EPA began the cleanup in 2016.  For OU5:  Under EPA oversight, UPRR is conducting groundwater monitoring on a quarterly basis in the west parcel to assess the contingency plan activities. Twelve groundwater wells have been sampled. PCE was detected above the cleanup goal in four of the wells sampled, while the TCE cleanup goal was exceeded in one well.   EPA continues to oversee UPRR activities for the groundwater and soil cleanup. Contaminant concentrations in groundwater continue to decrease. Once these concentrations are below the respective cleanup goals, the contingency plans will be considered complete and a two year closure monitoring period will commence.  Vapor Intrusion Concerns at OU-5: In June 2013, an investigation revealed significant vapor intrusion contamination at the City Electric Department and the Mid Plains Construction Buildings, which are located adjacent to the west parcel.  Additional investigations are in progress.  Vapor intrusion assessment and mitigation were conducted and completed by UPRR under EPA oversight. UPRR is also continuing the quarterly monitoring of the west parcel groundwater and soil. The work and contingency plans will continue until the OU5 meets the remedial objectives and goals of the OU5 ROD, as amended. The protectiveness statement in the 2013 Five-Year Review was deferred until the VI investigation and mitigation was completed.  An addendum was submitted indicating the completion of the assessment in 2015. Vapor intrusion mitigation system for the City Electric and Mid Plains Buildings is currently under Operations, Maintenance and Monitoring. CH2M Hill (PRP Contractor UPRR) submits a progress report to the EPA for activities completed at the site on a monthly basis. The Monitoring program also includes quarterly groundwater monitoring and sampling of the wells at the site. The EPA reviews all these reports and when comments are generated copies are submitted to the PRP and the state of Nebraska. Due to increases in the PCE concentrations, plans are underway to conduct additional investigation to determine the causes and solutions. CH2M, EPA and the state of Nebraska will continue discussing the results of these investigation and groundwater monitoring results and decide on a plan of action.   The next Five-Year Review is scheduled for 2028.
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
There are deed restrictions in place at all OUs.

Sampling and Monitoring
The Nebraska Department of Environment and Energry has performed groundwater sampling for OUs 1-4. The PRP has performed sampling at OU5.

Emergency Response and Removal
Site cleanup has also included removal actions or short-term cleanups to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Immediate actions included the disconnection of the well from the public water supply and extraction of contaminated groundwater.
