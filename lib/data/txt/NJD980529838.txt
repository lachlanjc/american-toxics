Background
The Krysowaty Farm site is located in Hillsborough Township, New Jersey. The 1-acre site was a waste disposal area where about 500 drums of paint and dye wastes were dumped, crushed and buried from 1965 to 1970. Other wastes, including demolition debris, tires, automobiles, bulk wastes, solvents and waste sludge were also disposed of at the farm. Local residents became concerned when they smelled odors in their well water. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) investigated the site in 1979 and found volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the groundwater. Hillsborough Township provided bottled water to nearby residents in 1982. Following site cleanup in 1985 and 1986, EPA took the site off the Superfund Program’s National Priorities List in 1989.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Immediate Action: In 1982, Hillsborough Township began to provide bottled water to nearby residents affected by contaminated well water.Long-term Cleanup: In 1984, EPA selected a remedy to clean up the site. It included excavating soil and wastes and disposing of them at an approved facility; providing a permanent alternate water supply to the residents affected by contaminated well water; and monitoring the site for five years to ensure the actions had been effective.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site was addressed in two stages: an immediate action and a long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site. Site cleanup included excavated and disposed of contaminated soil off site to an approved hazardous waste disposal facility.The State of New Jersey monitored the groundwater for five years to 
ensure that the cleanup activities have been effective. This monitoring 
program was completed in 1991 and the results indicated that there were 
no contaminants in the groundwater. As a result, NJDEP sealed the 
monitoring wells. The permanent alternate water supply pipeline was 
installed for residents threatened by contaminated well water. Following site cleanup in 1985 and 1986, EPA took the site off the Superfund Program’s National Priorities List in 1989.
