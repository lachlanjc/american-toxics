### Background

The Baghurst Drive Superfund Site is located just outside of Harleysville, Pennsylvania. The site consists of a groundwater plume contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The plume affects a small community of single family homes, a sizeable number of which draw their water from a community well. The source of the VOCs is unknown.  
  
In 1999, the Montgomery County Health Department discovered the plume when they sampled residential wells in the area. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) immediately began supplying 27 residences with bottled drinking water and subsequently equipped the homes with carbon filtration systems. PADEP conducted an investigation to identify the source of the contamination, but was unable to produce any concrete documentation regarding the source.  
  
In 2014, the site was added to the National Priorities List, making it eligible for long-term investigation and cleanup under EPA's Superfund program.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has provided affected residences with carbon filtration systems and/or bottled water. EPA is monitoring the effectiveness of the residential well treatment systems through regular sampling.

EPA determined that a permanent alternative water supply is necessary in advance of the remediation of the underlying plume of contamination. EPA is currently designing an extension of the public waterline to affected residences. This process is ongoing, with construction scheduled to begin Fall 2021.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

On May 18th, 2022, EPA made the Record of Decision document publicly available. This document describes the details of EPA's final cleanup plan.

The Preferred Alternative for cleaning up this site is:

*In Situ Thermal Remediation of Source Area and In Situ Chemical Oxidation in Hot Spot Areas.* This includes

- In Situ Thermal Remediation (ISTR) to treat source area groundwater
- In Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO) to treat groundwater hot spot areas
- Monitoring groundwater and vapor intrusion
- Institutional Controls (ICs)

EPA believes that this will be the most effective way to in address contaminated groundwater at the site because it will permanently treat the areas of contamination.

EPA is currently in the Remedial Design (RD) phase of the cleanup process where the details of the remedy selected in the ROD are planned.

EPA constructed an extension of the public waterline to residences affected by volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Construction began in Fall 2021 and was completed in September 2022. Construction of the booster station, which will help maintain consistent water pressure and provide adequate flow, and the water storage tank are being constructed along the third baseline of the baseball field in Rahmer Park.

### Sampling and Monitoring

As part of the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study, EPA has sampled soil, groundwater, surface water,sediment and soil vapor. Additionally, the EPA Removal Program regularly monitors residential well treatment systems.

The [Administrative Record](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/collection/03/AR63703) contains more information about sampling and analysis.

### Emergency Response and Removal

EPA's Removal Program continues to provide bottled water and maintain carbon treatment systems at the residential properties in the area. A waterline is being extended to provide clean water to the residents. This line is being extended from Lower Frederick Township and will serve approximately 30 homes that are known to be affected by the plume. EPA is working with Upper Salford Township, Lower Frederick Township, Montgomery County, and the Schwenksville Water Authority during the design and construction process.
