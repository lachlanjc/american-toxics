### Background

The Cooper Road site covers an area of less than 100 square feet in Voorhees Township, New Jersey. The site is an old borrow pit that had been excavated for fill material. In 1982, several dozen one- to two-ounce glass vials containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were discovered on the site. Some of the vials were broken; most were intact. After cleanup of the vials and contaminated soil, follow-up sampling found no significant levels of any contaminants in the soils or groundwater. EPA determined that the site no longer posed a threat to human health or the environment and removed it from the Superfund programâ€™s National Priorities List in February 1989.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The significant risks and threats to the community and the environment were eliminated when the owners, under State supervision, removed the glass vials and excavated six inches of the underlying soil. EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 1989.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site was addressed in a single phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.

EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 1989.
