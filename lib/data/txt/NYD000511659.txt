### Background

The Pollution Abatement Services (PAS) site, located in Oswego, New York, is a 15.5-acre former high-temperature, liquid chemical waste, incineration facility, which operated from 1970 to 1977. Beginnng in 1973, the facility experienced operational problems and was cited for numerous air and water quality violations by state and federal agencies. Because the incinerator never operated properly, more than 10,000 leaking and deteriorating drums accumulated on-site, more than a million gallons of oil and mixed hydrocarbons accumulated in three lagoons, and contaminated waste oil accumulated in several aboveground and underground storage tanks. As a result, the site soil and groundwater were contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and the sediments in the adjacent White and Wine Creeks, which flow into Lake Ontario, were contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). A number of emergency cleanup activities were performed at the site by the U.S. Coast Guard, EPA, and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC). After response actions were taken to reduce the immediate threat to human health and the environment, in 1983, EPA placed the site on the Superfund Program’s National Priorities List.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed in four stages: immediate removal actions and three long-term remedial phases focused on waste containment and the prevention of off-site migration of contaminated groundwater.

Over a 10-year span, various removal actions were conducted at the site to reduce the threat to the public and the environment. In 1976, a dike was built to prevent the overflow of contaminants into the groundwater and soil in the surrounding area. In 1977, contaminated water from the on-site lagoons was treated and discharged. The site was fenced in 1980 to prevent unauthorized access and 500 drums were overpacked and relocated on-site. In 1981, an additional 1,200 drums were overpacked and surface runoff controls were installed. In 1982, EPA removed the superstructures and approximately 10,000 drums from the site.

In 1984, EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD), selecting a long-term remedy to address the residual waste and groundwater and soil contamination at the site. The remedy included limited excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated materials; installation of a perimeter slurry wall containment system; site grading and capping in accordance with Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) requirements; installation of a leachate collection and treatment system; and groundwater monitoring. NYSDEC implemented the remedial actions called for in the ROD, with the exception of the treatment system. Rather than installing an on-site treatment system, NYSDEC collected the leachate from 1986 through 1991 and transported it off-site to a RCRA-approved treatment/disposal facility.

In 1987, groundwater monitoring results indicated that contamination might be present outside the slurry wall containment system. Under an Administrative Order on Consent with EPA, a group of potentially responsible parties evaluated the integrity of the existing containment system at the site, assessed the contamination outside the containment system, and identified and evaluated remedial alternatives to remedy the possible breach in the containment system.

EPA issued a second ROD for the site in 1993. The 1993 ROD incorporated all of the existing components of the 1984 ROD, as well as, several additional items, including enhancing the source control system by optimizing the leachate extraction rate and other operating parameters to achieve, to the degree practicable, inward horizontal gradients in the overburden and upward vertical gradients from the bedrock toward the containment system; discharging the extracted leachate and contaminated groundwater into the City of Oswego's wastewater treatment plant; connecting downgradient residents in the Smith's Beach area who were using residential wells to the public water supply to ensure that potential future exposure to contaminants in the bedrock groundwater does not occur; and, institutional controls on groundwater usage at and downgradient from the site. The ROD also provided for the construction of an on-site treatment system with discharge to surface water or groundwater as a contingent option should discharging to the City of Oswego's wastewater treatment plant be deemed infeasible.

Leachate and contaminated groundwater continued to be collected and transported off-site for treatment and disposal until EPA issued an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) in 1996, in which EPA documented its determination that the preferred option for the treatment and disposal of the extracted leachate and groundwater to the City of Oswego wastewater treatment facility was not viable at that time and that the contingent option was significantly more costly than off-site treatment. Therefore, EPA concluded that off-site treatment of the extracted leachate and groundwater should continue. The ESD further stated that construction of an on-site treatment system and discharge to surface water or to groundwater would be retained as a contingent option to be implemented in the event that off-site treatment became infeasible or significantly more costly than on-site treatment. The ESD also required that a focused feasibility study (FFS) be conducted to evaluate remedial alternatives for the PCB-impacted sediments in the creeks and wetlands adjacent to the site.

The FFS determined that the site is not presently a source of PCB contamination to the sediments in the adjacent wetlands and Wine and White Creeks (although it was a likely source of PCB contamination before the construction of the containment facility in 1986). The study also identified two potential, upstream sources of PCBs in the sediments in the wetlands and creeks near the site. Because residual PCBs from the site may remain in the sediments of the adjacent White and Wine Creeks and, therefore, could act as a continuing source of contamination, in 1997, EPA issued a third ROD selecting a remedy to address the contaminated sediments. The selected remedy requires long-term monitoring of the PCB-contaminated sediments in the creeks.

The extracted leachate and groundwater (approximately 10,000 gallons every month) was transported to an EPA-approved treatment and disposal facility for many years. Following a study that indicated that due to decreases in contaminant concentrations, the discharge of leachate into the city of Oswego’s Eastside Wastewater Treatment Plant was viable (previously, the contaminant concentrations were too high to be sucessfully treated at the facility), in 2010, EPA issued an ESD. This ESD modified the remedy to allow for direct discharge of leachate from the site to the treatment plant instead of off-site treatment and disposal. The extracted leachate (between 10,000 and 20,000 gallons per month) is currently discharged directly to the treatment plant.

The immediate and long-term cleanup actions undertaken at the site greatly reduced the threat to public health and the environment. These efforts include the treatment and discharge of more than one million gallons of contaminated water contained in on-site lagoons; the removal of more than 10,000 drums containing liquid waste; the construction of a waste containment system, consisting of a perimeter slurry wall, an impermeable cap and a leachate collection system; and the extraction and off-site treatment of over 6 million gallons of leachate.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Groundwater monitoring and leachate collection and treatment are ongoing at the site. Under current site conditions, potential or actual human exposures are under control.

Five-year reviews are conducted at sites to ensure that the remedies that have been put into place protect public health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. In June 1998, December 2003, December 2008, January 2014, February 2019, and December 2023, EPA issued Five-Year Review reports which concluded that the remedial actions at the site were implemented in accordance with the remedies selected in the RODs and that the remedies set forth in the RODs are fully protective of human health and the environment. It is anticipated that the seventh Five-Year Review for the site will be completed by December 2028.
