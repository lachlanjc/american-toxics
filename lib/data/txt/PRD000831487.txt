Background
PROTECO is located in the Town of Peñuelas in southern Puerto Rico and operated as a hazardous waste landfill from 1975 through 1999.  Groundwater on site is contaminated with Mercury, and organic based solvents including; Tetrachloroethylene (PCE), 1,1-Dichloroethylene (DCE), Trichloroethylene (TCE), Trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene (Trans-1,2-DCE), 1,1,1-Trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA), 1,1-Dichloroethane (1,1-DCA), and 1,2-Dichloroethane (DCA).  PROTECO conducted landfill closure activities in the 1990s, but abandoned the site in 2009 and has not conducted required maintenance or monitoring.  The uncontained waste sources and contaminated groundwater at the site threaten contamination of private and public supply wells in the area, which serves more than 17,000 people.
