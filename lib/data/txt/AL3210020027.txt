### Background

The 15,319-acre Anniston Army Depot (ANAD) is an active U.S. Army (Army) installation in Calhoun County, Alabama, 10 miles west of Anniston. The installation provides munitions storage and refurbishment, testing and decommissioning of combat vehicles and various types of ordnance. In the past, operations at ANAD generated solid and liquid wastes that contaminated soil and groundwater. EPA placed a portion of ANAD on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1989. In 1990, EPA and the Army agreed to address the entire Depot under the Superfund and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) programs. The Army, EPA and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up ANAD in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. By cleaning up and monitoring ANAD's soil and groundwater, enforcing land use controls, and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, the Army, EPA and ADEM continue to protect people and the environment from contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Army leads the investigation and cleanup of the site, with oversight provided by EPA and ADEM.

Over the years, the Army has started RCRA- and Superfund-related actions that have addressed contamination and disposal issues at the Depot. These actions have included treating groundwater contamination; removing and disposing of contaminated soil; treating contaminated soil on site; covering soils as needed, and emergency response planning for off-site groundwater contamination.

The Army continues to capture and treat contaminated groundwater using an upgraded on-site groundwater interception system and an air-stripping treatment system at the Krebs Water Treatment Plant. The Army is also addressing contaminated fractured bedrock. The Army plans to use specialized technologies to treat areas where it has identified sources of dense non-aqueous phase liquid at OU1. At OU3 the Army has determined that additional source material needs to be removed to enable groundwater remediation to succeed. The Army continues to investigate contamination in soils and groundwater at OU4 and OU5.

The Depot’s 2025 Five-Year Review will be started soon to evaluate the cleanup approaches used for OU-1, OU-2 and OU-3. Updates will be provided regarding issues identified in previous Five-Year Review Reports. Previous reviews found that the cleanup approach for OU-2 and OU-3 continues to protect people and the environment from remaining site contamination. Previous reviews have found that the cleanup approach for OU-1 was not successfully treating OU-1 groundwater contamination, that COCs for operable units needed to be clarified, that a protective concentration of contaminants in groundwater is needed to determine if the remedy at OU1 is protective of the Pygmy Sculpin at Coldwater Spring, and that source material needed removal at OU3 followed by an evauation of MNA as a remedy.

High levels of groundwater contamination remain underneath the Depot and low levels of groundwater contamination continue to spread to the Depot boundary, with limited low level contamination potentially impacting Coldwater Spring just outside the boundary. While groundwater treatment continues, the Army is now constructing a different groundwater cleanup option which includes an improved pump and treat system as well as treatment of the source of groundwater contamination below ground level.

In 2000, the Army worked with the local municipal water supply to install five air-stripping towers. The Army paid for the construction of the towers and the municipal water provider pays for the towers’ operation. Operators use the towers to remove VOCs in groundwater. Plant operators now treat all water in Coldwater Spring before supplying water to the public. Treated water at the plant does not contain harmful levels of VOCs.

A multi-agency task force, made up of representatives from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ADEM, the State of Alabama’s Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and EPA, performs studies related to groundwater toxicity levels at the Depot as part of efforts to protect local wildlife. The task force is working to protect the Pygmy Sculpin, a fish native to Alabama that only lives in the Coldwater Spring area. The Army is implementing the task force’s recommendations.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Investigations and cleanup activities have focused on five areas, which EPA refers to as operable units, or OUs. These OUs refer to distinct areas of the Depot and include: OU-1, Southeast Industrial Area (SIA) groundwater; OU-2, SIA soil; OU-3, Ammunition Storage Area; OU-4, Military Munitions Response Program; and OU-5, Western Industrial Area.

The Army and EPA have issued a series of cleanup plans (Records of Decision, or RODs) for OUs 1-3. Cleanup activities selected in the 1991 interim ROD for OU-1 (SIA groundwater) include the pumping and treatment of contaminated groundwater. In July 2015, an Amendment to the Interim ROD for OU-1 was signed and includes an enhanced groundwater interceptor system with a re-design of the pump and treatment system along with a aggressive bioremediation system. Cleanup activities selected in the 2008 ROD for OU-2 (SIA soil) include digging up or capping contaminated soil and using land use controls. Cleanup activities selected in the 2006 ROD for OU-3 (Ammunition Storage Area) include digging up and treating contaminated soils, using monitored natural attenuation for groundwater contamination, and applying land use controls.

The Army and EPA will issue RODs for OU-4 (Military Munitions Response Program) and OU-5 (Western Industrial Area) in the future.

The Army is continuing ground water treatment while also evaluating alternative ground water treatment approaches.

EPA completed the fifth [Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11155118.pdf) in September 2020. The next Review will be completed by September 2025.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Land Use Controls (LUCs) prohibit the use of groundwater for drinking or irrigation purposes, calls for fencing of the Depot and associated signage, requires notification of private well owners as a reminder to not use or drink the groundwater, and also requires maintenance and monitoring of remedial systems as well as these use restrictions. The Depot must institutionalize these LUCs into their management systems and inspect and report on the implementation and success of these LUCs annually.

### Sampling and Monitoring

A multi-agency task force, made up of representatives from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ADEM, the State of Alabama’s Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and EPA, performs studies related to ground water toxicity levels at the Depot as part of efforts to protect local wildlife. The task force is working to protect the Pygmy Sculpin, a fish native to Alabama that only lives in the Coldwater Spring area.

The Army continues to monitor groundwater at each OU to ensure remedies are effective.

### Emergency Response and Removal

The Army removed Building 172 in OU3 as it was believed to have been a continuing source of explosive contamination in groundwater and may have presented explosive hazards. The removal decontaminated building materials and contaminated soils, as needed. The Army will determine if additional treatment is needed for the remaining saturated soils and/or upper portion of the groundwater aquifer.

### Enforcement Information

For many years, the EPA has been working with its federal and state partners to clean up the Depot. In 1990, the Army signed a three-party Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) with the EPA and ADEM. The FFA helps make sure that the parties fully investigate environmental impacts associated with past and present activities at the installation and undertake and complete appropriate cleanup actions.
