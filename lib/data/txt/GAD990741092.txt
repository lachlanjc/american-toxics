### Background

The eight-acre Diamond Shamrock Corporation Landfill [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in Cedartown, Georgia. The site includes an area used to dispose of waste oil and other waste products from chemical manufacturing operations in the late 1960s or 1970s.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1990 because of contaminated groundwater resulting from the disposal area waste. EPA, the [Georgia Environmental Protection Division (Georgia EPD)](https://epd.georgia.gov/) and the site’s [potentially responsible party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) have investigated site conditions.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. Residents and businesses use the public water system for drinking water. By monitoring groundwater and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, Georgia EPD and the site’s PRP continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The PRP leads site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and Georgia EPD.

**1990**  
The PRP treated about 1,500 cubic yards of waste-impacted soil using bioremediation, which is the use of living organisms to break down contaminants. The PRP also incinerated about 8,400 gallons of liquid waste at a licensed hazardous waste disposal facility. The PRP determined that remaining site soils met cleanup standards that allow for unrestricted use.

**1994**  
The site’s long-term remedy, selected in 1994, included using institutional controls to prevent groundwater use and drilling, completing and maintaining site access restrictions in the form of fencing and signage, and monitoring ground and surface water to confirm that natural attenuation processes are effective and that contaminants are not spreading.

**1995**  
Long-term remedy activities began in 1995.

**1997**  
EPA updated the long-term remedy in 1997 to change the manganese cleanup goal from 200 micrograms per liter to 850 micrograms per liter. This change did not fundamentally change the cleanup approach, and the cleanup remained fully protective of people and the environment.

**2021**  
The [most recent Five-Year Review,](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11166407) completed in 2021, concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11166407) was published in 2021. The remedy at the Site currently protects human health and the environment because there are no exposures occurring.

The site’s long-term remedy, selected in 1994, included using institutional controls to prevent groundwater use and drilling, completing and maintaining site access restrictions in the form of fencing and signage, and monitoring ground and surface water to confirm that natural attenuation processes are effective and that contaminants are not spreading.

EPA updated the long-term remedy in 1997 to change the manganese cleanup goal from 200 micrograms per liter to 850 micrograms per liter. This change did not fundamentally change the cleanup approach, and the cleanup remained fully protective of people and the environment.

Construction and other physical cleanup activities have been completed at the site. Cleanup of ground water contamination is mostly complete, except for manganese. Residents and businesses connect to the public water system or use wells not affected by remaining ground water contamination. Institutional controls are in place to restrict ground water use.

Ground water monitoring is ongoing. The site is fenced and locked.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The site is fenced and locked.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site PRP to investigate and clean up the site. The PRP continues to fund site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
