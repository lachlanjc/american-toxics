### Background

The 2-acre Metal Working Shop site is located between Lake View and Lake Ann, Michigan. From 1974 to 1977, the owner of the property finished metals in the shop. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil and groundwater with low levels of hazardous chemicals. Following investigations, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1992.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1992, EPA completed an investigation to determine the nature and extent of contamination, including sampling of monitoring wells, residential wells, surface and subsurface soils, and lakes. The investigation results showed that the concentration of contaminants at the site did not pose a threat to public health or the environment. Therefore, EPA determined that no cleanup actions were necessary and took the site off the NPL in 1992.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The groundwater and soil were believed to be contaminated with low levels of volatile organic compounds. However, extensive sampling conducted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revealed no contamination above natural levels. Because contamination levels were very low and the site contaminants were not migrating, no threat to the public or the environment existed.
