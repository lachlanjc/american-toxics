### Background

**Current Status**

The EPA has developed a conceptual site model and a sampling plan concerning investigation of the site. Planning activities associated with implementation of the sampling plan have been completed. Sampling activities were initiated on January 12, 2015 and completed by the end of March 2015. Approximately 875 surface and subsurface soils samples were collected from approximately 142 locations and 10 background locations. These samples were analyzed for Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC’s), Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC’s), Metals, Dioxins/Furans, Hexavalent Chrome, Aroclor’s/Pesticides, Tetraethyl Lead, Asbestos, and soil physical properties. Twelve ground water monitoring wells were installed and were also sampled. EPA completed a third phase of remedial investigation (RI) activities which investigated waste areas, surface water, sediment, and private water wells (approximately 175 samples). Ground water information was also collected to classify the ground water that will factor into remedy decisions. EPA completed a final round of sampling in 2016 to fill in some data gaps after analysis of all of the previous sampling events. EPA completed a [Remedial Investigation (RI) Report](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/06/100005529) in September 2017 and a [Feasiblity Study (FS)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/06/100023028) in July 2020. The FS describes various potential remedial alternatives that may be implemented at the site. The EPA issued a [Proposed Plan](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/06/100023338.pdf) on May 24, 2021, that described the potential remedial alternatives for the site. A virtual public meeting was held on May 27, 2021, where EPA presented the various alternatives described in the proposed plan and solicited public comments. After consideration of the few public comments received, the EPA finalized a [Record of Decision](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/06/100024590.pdf) concerning the selected remedy for the Site on August 25, 2021.

**Site Background**

The EVR-Wood Treating/Evangeline Refining Company (EVR) site is located near Jennings, Louisiana, in an unincorporated area of Acadia Parish. Past site uses include an oil refinery and a creosote and wolmanizing preserving facility. Site activities and waste disposal practices contaminated soil and wetland sediment with hazardous chemicals. Investigations are underway to assess the nature and extent of contamination and to explore appropriate cleanup options.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.

The facility started creosote operations in the late 1940s. Creosoting operations ceased around 1980. The facility closed in 1985. The operation was involved in the preservation of timber products, principally fence posts and lumber, through pressure processes. The former processing area contained several tanks with hazard communication signs identifying contents as Wolmanac Concentrate 50%. Wolmanac is a trademark preservative which consists of chromium copper arsenate (CCA). PCP was also used in the dry treating process. The wood treatment facility and refinery properties were previously owned by Mr. Burt McBurney.

The Evangeline Refinery Co. operated an oil refinery from 1938 to 1981. The refinery produced naphtha, kerosene, diesel and No. 5 fuel oil from sweet condensate. When the refinery was sold, Mr. McBurney retained control of the wood-treating plant. The refinery was sold with the understanding that the treatment plant could send wastewater to the refinery on an as-needed basis. Evangeline Refinery received wood-treating wastewater into their lagoons from EVR-Wood Treating Co. "via a pipe across the fence."

### What Is the Current Site Status?

From 2001 to 2011, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) performed periodic inspections to document conditions at the site and attempted to work with the property owner to address further action. Sampling in September 2011 on site and in the wetlands area confirmed the presence of contaminants.  
  
EPA completed the site’s remedial investigation and feasibility study. Ground water and soil sampling was performed in January/February 2015. Sampling related to the EVR-Wood process area, surface water and sediment from Bayou Nezpique, and wetlands near the site was performed in October/November 2015. A final round of sampling to fill in data gaps upon reviewing all the previous sampling events was completed in 2016. The EPA completed a [Remedial Investigation (RI)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/06/100005529) / [Feasibility Study (FS) Report](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/06/100023028) in 2020. The EPA issued a [Proposed Plan](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/06/100023338.pdf) on May 24, 2021, that described the potential remedial alternatives for the site. The EPA conducted a virtual public meeting on May 27, 2021, where the EPA described the potential alternatives for the site and solicited public comments. After consideration of the few public comments received, the EPA finalized a [Record of Decision](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/06/100024590.pdf) concerning the selected remedy for the Site on August 25, 2021.
