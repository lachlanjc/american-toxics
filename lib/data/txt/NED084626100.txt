Background
The 60-acre Sherwood Medical Co. site is located in Norfolk, Madison County, Nebraska. Sherwood Medical Co. began its operations at the site in 1961. Medical syringes and other medical products were manufactured at this facility using injection-molding processes. Chlorinated solvents were used during the manufacturing processes, which resulted in soil and groundwater contamination beneath the facility consisting mainly of volatile organic compounds. The facility continues to manufacture medical equipment and is currently owned and operated by Cardinal Health. Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing at the site. The EPA completed the Fifth Five-Year Review for the site in August 2023. The review determined the remedy currently protects human health and the environment because contaminated groundwater is stable and institutional controls in the form of deed restrictions and environmental covenants are in place.  In 2023, routine groundwater sampling will be conducted to monitor the stability of the contaminant plume and groundwater concentrations. Current groundwater data indicates concentrations are decreasing, and the plume is stable and not migrating off-site. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed by the potentially responsible party, with EPA oversight. In 1987, a groundwater sample collected by the Nebraska Health Department from the Park Mobile Home Court, located on the northeastern part of the Sherwood Medical Co. property, contained VOCs. In 1988, the EPA supplied the PMHC residents with potable water by first providing bottled water and then by installing an activated carbon water treatment system on the water supply well. Additional investigations identified the Sherwood Medical Co. facility as the source of VOC contamination. O﻿n July 29, 1991, the site was subsequently proposed for the National Priority List, and placed on the NPL on October 14, 1992.  The EPA issued a Record of Decision on September 28, 1993, selecting the remedial action to address the site contaminants. The components of the remedy include: deed restrictions, providing a permanent supply of potable water to the PMHC, groundwater monitoring, removal of the septic system, excavation and low-temperature thermal treatment of contaminated soils and extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater. An Explanation of Significant Differences document was issued on September 5, 1995, which changed the soil treatment method from thermal treatment to ex situ soil vapor extraction. The Preliminary Closeout Report was signed on September 24, 1999, allowing the site to be considered construction complete. Once groundwater cleanup levels have been achieved, a Final Close-out Report will be produced.
The EPA has conducted five Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect human health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review, completed in August 2023, determined the groundwater remedy currently protects human health and the environment because contaminated groundwater is stable and institutional controls in the form of deed restrictions are in place.

What Is the Current Site Status?
In September 2013, the third Five-Year Review was completed. The review determined the remedy at the site is protective of human health and the environment through hydraulic containment and treatment of groundwater contamination by the groundwater extraction and treatment system in addition to institutional controls that are in place. In October 2014, a horizontal soil vapor extraction system was installed directly beneath the source area, on the southwest corner of the manufacturing building, which consisted of four SVE wells. The SVE system was implemented to accelerate groundwater cleanup. The system operated between November 2014 and April 2017 and was successful at removing an estimated total mass of 755 lbs of volatile organic compounds The system was decommissioned in 2017 due to reduced VOC removal rates.  2018: The GET system was shut down in 2017 under a pilot study based on the reduced VOC removal rates. Since system startup in 1999, the GET system has removed 1,192 lbs of VOC mass. The mass removal rates decreased significantly to an estimated mass removal of 6.84 lbs in 2015. Quarterly groundwater monitoring is being conducted to ensure the plume is stable. The fourth Five-Year Review was completed in September 2018. The review determined the groundwater remedy currently protects human health and the environment because contaminated groundwater is stable and institutional controls in the form of deed restrictions are in place. However, for the remedy to be protective in the long-term, the following actions need to be taken: conduct a focused site investigation and feasibility study to support a decision document modification.  In 2020, routine groundwater sampling was conducted in the Spring and Fall to evaluate the stability of the plume and if natural attenuation is occurring. In 2021, routine groundwater sampling will be conducted to ensure the plume is stable and not migrating off-site. In 2022, routine groundwater sampling will be conducted to monitor the stability of the contaminant plume and groundwater concentrations. Current groundwater data indicates concentrations are decreasing, the plume is stable and is not migrating off-site. The EPA started the fifth Five-Year Review in July 2022. The fifth Five-Year Review is planned to be completed in August 2023. In 2023, the EPA completed the fifth Five-Year Review and concluded the remedy at the site is protective of human health and the environment. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Deed restrictions have been filed with the Madison County, Register of Deeds prohibiting land disturbance in soil areas and use of groundwater supply wells in the impacted portion of the aquifer. The groundwater related deed restrictions remain in effect, as documented annually by the respondents. No soil restrictions remain since the required soil excavation and treatment activities have been completed. Three environmental covenants were recorded for the properties that were connected to the municipal water supply. The activity and use limitations for the properties included a.) groundwater from the properties shall not be consumed or otherwise used for any purpose, except for the collection of groundwater samples for environmental analysis or collection or treatment of groundwater for remediation purposes related to the Sherwood Medical Co. Superfund site, but only to the extent arising out of that site, and b.) the properties shall remain connected to the public community water supply for its potable water.

Sampling and Monitoring
In 2025, routine groundwater sampling will be conducted to monitor the stability of the contaminant plume and groundwater concentrations.
