### Background

The Old ESCO Manufacturing site is located in Greenville, Hunt County, Texas. The site is a former electrical transformer and specialty switch gear manufacturer. ESCO began operations on the property in the late 1940s and continued operating on site until about 1970, when it relocated to another property in Greenville. During this time, ESCO was leasing the property and building. In 1983, ESCO purchased this property and owned it until it defaulted for non-payment of taxes in 2001. ESCO filed for bankruptcy in 1990.The property is currently zoned light industrial. According to the city of Greenville Community Development Director, the city master plan shows the future land use for this property as low density residential/park/open space.

Contaminants of concern include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and lead. Following three sucessful EPA Superfund removal actions, all clean up activities are complete. The EPA's current plans are to de-list the site from the NPL and this is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2016.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through the EPA Superfund removal and remedial program actions.

NPL Listing History:

Proposed Date: March 2008

NPL Update: No. 1 Final Date: September 2008

The EPA is the lead agency for the site. The State of Texas, represented by the TCEQ, is the support agency.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

### Sampling and Monitoring

EPA has performed an ecological risk assessment. The objective of the ecological risk assessment was to evaluate potential effects on ecological receptors resulting from the chemicals identified in environmental media at the Esco Site. The ecological evaluation used the Tier 1 Ecological Criteria Checklist described in the TRRP (30 TAC §350). The summary of the sediment and surface water sampling results is stated below and the evaluation indicated that no further action was necessary to protect ecological receptors. Sediment and surface water samples were collected from twelve co-located locations within Horse Creek and the Cowleech Fork of the Sabine River (AOC 2058) to determine the nature and extent of site-related contaminants due to potential storm water run-off and/or historical disposal practices. One sediment sample collected at location AOC 2058-006 exceeded the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) sediment benchmark for total PCBs of 0.0598 mg/kg with a concentration of 0.074 mg/kg. A total of nine sediment samples collected at locations 2058-002 thru 009 and 011 exceeded the TCEQ sediment benchmark for Aroclor 1260 of 0.005 mg/kg with a high concentration of 0.0502 mg/kg. A total of three sediment samples collected at location 2058-002, 005 and 006 had detections for Aroclor 1254 at 0.0274, 0.0201 and 0.065 mg/kg respectively. There is no TCEQ sediment benchmark value for Aroclor 1254. All twelve of the surface water samples showed no detection of Aroclors, but the laboratory had difficulty achieving detection limits below the Texas surface water quality standards. Assessment of risk for benthic macro invertebrates was conducted for AOC 2058. There is potential to impair the function, health, or reproductive success to benthic macro invertebrates from sediments in AOC 2058 based on the maximum Aroclor 1254 and Aroclor 1260 concentrations. It is uncertain whether members of the benthic community will experience adverse effects due to exposure to PCBs while residing in Horse Creek or the Cowleech Fork of the Sabine River due to the use of the maximum concentrations for screening purposes and the degree of conservatism in the current exposure assumptions. Further assessment indicates that the 95UCLs for both Aroclor 1254 (0.032 mg/kg) and Aroclor 1260 (0.018 mg/kg) are below the consensus-based sediment screening values from MacDonald et. al. (2000) for protection of benthic macro invertebrates 0.060 mg/kg. Aroclor 1254 is also infrequently detected further decreasing the potential for adverse health effects from sediments. Thus, the assessment indicates that the benthic macro invertebrate community is not likely to experience adverse health effects due to sediment concentrations.

During June 2010, the EPA received the following draft reports from the EPA remedial contractor, Remedial Investigation (RI), Feasibility Study (FS), Screening Level Ecological Risk Assessment (SLERA), Base Line Human Health Risk Assessment (BHHRA), and the Ground Water Fate and Transport Modeling Report. The EPA and TCEQ have completed the review of the draft documents and all documents were finalized by the end of September 2010. The Final Close Out Report (FCOR) was signed on May 12, 2014.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included three removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment.

During August 2008, through January 2009, the EPA conducted the first Time Critical Removal Action that included the removal of PCB contaminated soils from 6 adjacent residential properties located directly east of the site; the restoration of these same 6 properties; the fencing of the perimeter of the on-site property; the removal of 120 cubic yards of asbestos containing materials (ACM), placement of ripple dams/storm water controls in drainage pathways between residential properties and the site to reduce the potential for contaminated soil backflow on to clean areas during flooding situations; and, placed ripple dams at periodic locations on the site drainage to reduce off-site soil migration. The EPA also assisted the county in removing the materials (hay, tires) stored in the on-site building for disposal.

The volumes of the wastes that were removed and disposed of during the August 2008, through January 2009, phase one off-site residential and on-site Removal Action are as follows;

· 120 cubic yards (CY) of asbestos containing materials (ACM) removed from theon-site building.

· 4,099 tons of Non-TSCA PCB contaminated soils

· 895 tons of TSCA PCB contaminated soils

During September 2009, through December 2009, the EPA conducted the second Time Critical Removal Action that included the removal of PCB contaminated soils from 3 residential properties and numerous adjacent road side drainage ditch grids and the restoration of the excavated properties.

The volumes of the wastes that were removed and disposed of during the September 2009, through December 2009, phase two off-site residential Removal Action are as follows;

· 3,192 tons of Non-TSCA PCB contaminated soils

During May 17, through September 29, 2011, the EPA conducted the third Time Critical Removal Action that included the removal of on-site PCB contaminated soils and the demolition of the on-site building and the building concrete foundation.Site restoration commenced June 24, 2011, upon receipt of the first delivery of backfill from a local Greenville vendor. Site restoration continued until September 29, 2011. Site restoration required the use of approximately 60,000 cubic yards of backfill soils.

The volumes of the wastes that were removed and disposed of during the May 2011, through September 2011, phase three on-site Removal Action are as follows;

· 28,288 tons of Non-TSCA PCB contaminated soils

· 24,137 tons of TSCA PCB contaminated soils

· 343 tons ofConstruction Debris

· 1,455 tons of Non-TSCA PCB contaminated class II concrete
