### Background

The half-acre Industrial Waste Processing site is located in Pinedale, California. A recycling facility reclaiming chemical compounds from petroleum residues, chlorinated solvents, and waste solder flux operated on site. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, and construction of the site’s long-term remedy, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

This site is being addressed in two stages: immediate actions and a long-term remedial phase focusing on cleanup of the entire site.

Immediate Actions: In 1988, EPA removed all asbestos found in bags, drums and building insulation, and all lead solder wastes in drums and piles; secured the site from unauthorized access; developed site safety plans; implemented dust suppression actions; monitored for fugitive vapors and dusts; and removed 19,000 gallons of hazardous liquids and 290 cubic yards of contaminated soil.

Entire Site: The cleanup, done by the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs), consisted of the removal of surface soils contaminated with lead and solvents, and natural attenuation of solvents in subsurface soils. The removal action consisted of the excavation, disposal and backfill of the top foot of soil on the site, including some soil around the site. About 2,352 tons of material was excavated from the site. A remedial investigation for the groundwater finished in May 1999.

Vapor samples were collected in 2006 in the commercial building on site. The risks related to vapor exceeded EPA's indoor air industrial screening levels. Vapor intrusion was mitigated by sealing around plumbing fixtures and plugging an open monitoring well inside the building. Follow-up indoor air samples were collected and analyzed in 2009 and 2018. The results indicated thatndoor air industrial screening levels were occasionalyexceeded. In 2021, EPA installed a sub-slab depressurization system to mitigate potential hazards from vapor intrusion. In 2024, a remedial investigation was performed and a Focused Feasibility Study is ongoing.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In September 2024, EPA completed the Fifth Five-Year Review for the Site. The Five-Year Review concluded that the response actions taken are protective of human health and the environment. The following issue and recommendation was identified in the report:

Issue: Elevated TCE and PCE concentrations in sub-slab soil-gas indicate there is a potential for a complete indoor air pathway should conditions change in the future.

Recommendation: EPA will need to select a final remedy in a Record of Decision to address the vapor intrusion risk.

Other Findings:

- Sub-slab soil-gas samples indicate there are still elevated levels of PCE and TCE under the sewing room and warehouse center. While concentrations have been greatly reduced since the SSDS system was installed, elevated soil-gas levels in these two locations indicate that the SSDS’s radius of influence may not be reaching all areas underneath the slab. Installing additional extraction points may be necessary.
- The potential for off-site vapor migration through preferential pathways, such as utility corridors, that could impact the adjacent residential structures needs to be evaluated.

The Five-Year Review further stated the following:

The response action at the Site currently protects human health and the environment because the response actions completed to-date, including placement of the sub-slab depressurization system, prevent indoor air exposure that could result in unacceptable risks at the Site. However, in order for the remedy to be protective in the long-term, the following actions need to be taken to ensure protectiveness: soil-gas plume delineation and remedy selection to address vapor intrusion risk. The protectiveness determination is that the measures are protective in the short term.
