### Background

The Leviathan Mine Superfund Site is a former underground and open-pit mine located high on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada in Alpine County, California. Mining activities at the 250-acre site began in the 1860s and continued on and off until the early 1960s. Historical mine operations at the site impacted soil and sediment on-site, as well as surface water, which includes mountain streams. The stream system drains north/northeast into Nevada approximately five miles from the disturbed area of the site. The Toiyabe National Forest surrounds the site and there are no permanent residents within several miles.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

There are three water collection and treatment systems operating at the site, capturing the five known discharges of mining-influenced water, which are known as early response actions.

One system continuously collects two discharges (adit and pit underdrain) via gravity into constructed, lined ponds and treats the collected water during the summer months. This treatment is a lime treatment system.

A second, biological treatment system operates year-round to address one discharge (Aspen seep), which typically treats more than three million gallons of impacted water per year.

The third system utilizes high density sludge (HDS) treatment for two discharges at the lowest elevation of the site. The HDS plant operates seasonally, typically from May to October, weather permitting. Power to this treatment system is provided by diesel generators. The diesel fuel is transported via over-the-road trucks during the treatment season.

The Atlantic Richfield Company and the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region, are the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) that EPA ordered to capture and treat the mining-influenced water discharges with the systems listed above. The treatment systems neutralize the water and reduce metals concentrations in the water prior to discharging into on-site streams.

After listing the site on the National Priorities List in May 2000, EPA ordered early cleanup activities and investigation of long-term remediation options. Since mining-influenced water collection and treatment began, the water quality of two downstream creeks, Leviathan and Bryant, has markedly improved while the treatment systems operate.

Monitoring: Various parties maintain monitoring programs. Stormwater runoff, snowmelt runoff, and surface water are monitored each year. Additionally, treatment systems and effluent discharges are monitored to confirm compliance with early response action discharge requirements. EPA closely coordinates cleanup plans and activities with all of the stakeholders, including local and state agencies from California and Nevada, the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs). In addition, the Washoe Tribe is strongly involved at the site to ensure that their unique traditional tribal uses of the area’s resources are protected.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Potentially responsible parties (PRPs) are completing the remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) for the site. The information from these studies will be used to plan cleanup actions at the site. As part of the RI/FS, human health and ecological risk assessments will be completed to evaluate the ways that contamination from the Superfund site may pose a risk to human and ecological health.

Ongoing treatment of mining-influenced water at the site is being addressed through early response actions. Final site clean-up decision-making will include a proposed plan for a long-term, year-round remedy to be provided for public comment. A record of decision will follow and final remedy design processes will then continue for several years.

### Enforcement Information

EPA directs and oversees cleanup plans and activities and coordinates with stakeholders, including local and state agencies from California and Nevada, the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California, the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the PRPs.
