### Background

The site is located near Bella Vista in Shasta County, California. The mine operated intermitently from 1862 to 1952 producing copper, zinc, lead, silver, and gold. Historic mine features and structures remain onsite and include various forms of mine waste contaminated with arsenic, copper, lead, and mercury. Past mining has contaminated the siteâ€™s:

- Soil
- Sediment
- Surface water

When water contacts contaminants, it creates acid mine drainage that carries contamination into waterways. This includes Little Cow and Afterthought creeks that are tributaries to the Sacramento River. Discarded fishing tackle has been observed along Little Cow Creek around the mine area. Fish in the creeks include largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, Chinook salmon, brown trout, brook trout, and rainbow trout. Eating these fish could create health risks.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The Superfund Program is responsible for cleaning up some of the nation's most contaminated land on what's called the National Priorities List (NPL). For the Site we have already:

- completed a Preliminary Evaluation and Site Inspection to better understand the site, and human and environmental risks.
- determined the site risk meet requirements to be add to the NPL and additional cleanup investigations.

In fall 2024, we will visit the site to:

- install a tool that will monitor and measure releases of harmful contamination from the Site.
- gain information to start contracting for cleanup investigations.

The Superfund Remedial Project Manager will be the lead and start coordination to investigate the site for cleanup. This includes beginning a study called a Remedial Investigation that evaluates the contamination, how much there is, and where it is located.
