### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included stabilization of hazardous waste, consolidation and off-site disposal of asbestos containing material, characterization of underground storage tanks, clearing of building debris, excavation and disposal of contaminated soils, and air and groundwater monitoring. EPA later updated the remedy to include further stabilization of hazardous waste, a contingency plan for soil cleanup, institutional controls to restrict future land uses to industrial uses, and operation and maintenance activities. Construction of the remedy finished in 2009. Following cleanup, EPA updated the remedy to remove institutional controls, operation and maintenance activities, and five-year reviews.
