### Background

The 72-acre Marion (Bragg) Dump site is located just outside of Marion in Grant County, Indiana. Formerly the location of a gravel pit, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and the Bragg Construction Company later leased the land for disposal of various wastes. The Bragg disposal facility closed in 1975. The RCA facility closed around 1970. Waste Reduction Systems also operated a transfer station on site from 1975 to 1977. The dump contains about 1.1 million cubic yards of wastes, some of which are hazardous, including solvents, plasticizers, lead and cadmium. Following cleanup, groundwater, pond and river monitoring is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The last five-year review for the site was completed in August of 2015.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is conducting its sixth five-year review of the Marion (Bragg) Dump Superfund Site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up - with waste managed on-site - to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. A summary of the cleanup activities and an evaluation of the protectiveness of the implemented cleanup remedies will be included in the five-year review report.

EPA’s cleanup actions at the site include capping a landfill, stabilizing a riverbank, and fencing in the property. EPA continues to monitor groundwater, pond, and river water. Deed restrictions at the site prevent groundwater access.

During the five-year review EPA will be conducting a site inspection, reviewing the status of the cleanup, and conducting a review of the current data. The review is expected to be completed in September 2025.
