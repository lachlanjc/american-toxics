### Background

The 200-acre Roebling Steel Company site, which is next to the Delaware River in Florence Township, New Jersey, was used to manufacture steel products. The Roebling Steel Company produced steel wire and cable at the site for many years before closing in the 1980s. Parts of the site were later used for other commercial and industrial operations, such as housing polymer reclamation, storing insulating products, refurbishing refrigerated trailers and shipping containers, and storing construction equipment. The raw materials and waste products produced by these operations were stored or buried in several on-site locations and contaminated the soil, sediment, and groundwater.

Seventy buildings occupied much of the site and contained contaminated process dust, exposed asbestos, and liquid and solid wastes from equipment, tanks, piping, pits, and sumps. The site included two inactive sludge lagoons and an abandoned landfill. The soil is contaminated with heavy metals like [lead](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts13.pdf), [chromium](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts7.pdf), and [cadmium](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts5.pdf). The nearby river, creek and wetland sediment were also contaminated with lead, chromium, [copper](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts132.pdf), and hazardous oils and tars. The site groundwater and a small number of area wells also showed contaminants.

The John A. Roebling's Sons Company built the steel plant in 1905, and also built an entire town for about 4,000 people to work at the steel plant. The surrounding village of Roebling and the Main Gate Building at the original entrance to the plant have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1978.

The John A. Roebling's Sons Company owned and operated the plant until its sale to Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (CF&I) in 1952. CF&I operated the plant from 1952 to 1974. John A. Roebling Steel Corporation (JARSCO) was formed in 1979 through the financial assistance from the Economic Development Administration (EDA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce. JARSCO stopped its operations in 1981. The EDA remained a creditor in possession of the real property and equipment until the property was turned over to Florence Township in 2001.

**History of Contamination**

In May 1968, the New Jersey Department of Health ordered CF&I to stop polluting the Delaware River and construct a wastewater treatment plant and by 1972, CF&I completed and began operating the wastewater treatment plant.

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) discovered six hundred 55-gallon drums containing waste oil during a 1979 inspection of the JARSCO site. NJDEP requested that JARSCO remove these drums and later cited JARSCO for health and safety violations in its attempt to remove the drums from the site. NJDEP later cited JARSCO for violating wastewater treatment regulations and named it one of the 38 hazardous waste sites most urgently needing cleanup in New Jersey.

EPA inspected the facility in 1981, and found violations, including that JARSCO was storing baghouse dust without a permit. That same year, NJDEP sampled the sludge lagoons and found they contained [volatile organic compounds](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/technical-overview-volatile-organic-compounds) (VOCs) and heavy metals. JARSCO removed 20,000 gallons of waste oil and 60 cubic yards of contaminated soil.

In 1982, NJDEP required JARSCO to install three groundwater monitoring wells near the lagoons and EPA directed JARSCO to stop storing hazardous waste without a permit, remove spilled dust and contaminated soil, and address contaminant migration. In February 1983, JARSCO officially abandoned the site without addressing the violations.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) packaged and removed picric acid and other chemicals found in the labs and shipped them to an approved treatment facility in 1985. EPA removed lab pack containers and drums containing corrosive and toxic materials, acid tanks, and compressed gas cylinders in 1987. EPA also fenced off a portion of the slag area and removed contaminated soil from Northwest Park in 1990. In the late 1990’s, EPA removed asbestos from about 70 abandoned buildings and exterior piping across the site.

EPA is addressing the site’s long-term cleanup in stages, called Operable Units (OUs). Under current conditions at the site, groundwater migration is under control.

EPA selected a [cleanup plan](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/63581.pdf) in 1990 to address the remaining sources of serious contamination, such as transformers contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), baghouse dust and chemical piles, additional drums and tanks, tires, and contaminated soil from the adjacent Roebling Park playground. EPA completed this work in 1991.

EPA selected a [second cleanup plan](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/63613.pdf) in 1991 for parts of Southeast Park, located next to the steel plant. EPA finished excavating, disposing contaminated soil and revegetating these areas in 1994. EPA [updated its 1991 cleanup plan](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/153490.pdf) in September 2003 for a 34-acre slag area, which is a byproduct of steel production. The revised plan included covering the soil and vegetation, as well as constructing a stormwater drainage system and a shoreline retaining wall to stabilize the slag area. EPA later modified the design plans and drawing for the slag area in September 2010 to accommodate additional volume for the dredged sediment. EPA finished installing the 3,000-foot shoreline retaining wall along the slag area in November 2006. In December 2014, EPA finished capping the soil and constructing a stormwater drainage system to manage and treat the stormwater from the Village of Roebling in the slag area.

EPA finalized its [third cleanup plan](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/63651.pdf) in September 1996, which included removing and disposing the underground storage tanks and piping and aboveground tanks, pits and sumps, as well as removing pollutants, demolishing the buildings, cleaning and disposing of contaminated equipment, and removing process dust. EPA finished decontaminating and demolishing buildings in May 2011. Additionally, EPA restored the Main Gate House and Ambulance Garage.

EPA finalized its [fourth cleanup plan](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/153490.pdf) in September 2003, addressing site-wide soil (including contaminated soil in the slag area), Delaware River and Crafts Creek sediment, and groundwater. The plan included capping site-wide contaminated soil, dredging contaminated sediment in the Delaware River and Crafts Creek, and long-term groundwater monitoring.

EPA used the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds to remove contaminated sediment from the Delaware River Back Channel and Crafts Creek. In June 2013, EPA completed dredging approximately 240,000 cubic yards of sediment from Crafts Creek and the Delaware River Back Channel. EPA also restored the wetland areas and installed a retaining wall along the entire shoreline.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The design plan for capping the remaining site soils was completed in September 2024. The EPA will monitor groundwater, cap remaining site soils, decontaminate and demolish buildings, and preserve some of the remaining historic equipment.

EPA anticipates doing the construction needed for the groundwater monitoring, soil capping, and buildings in 2025.
