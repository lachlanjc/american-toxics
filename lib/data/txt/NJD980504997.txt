### Background

The Burnt Fly Bog site is located in a semi-rural area, mostly in Marlboro Township in Monmouth County, New Jersey. It also extends into Old Bridge Township in Middlesex County. It covers about 1,700 acres and is located on the edge of the New Jersey Pine Barrens. The site was contaminated dduring the 1950s and the early 1960s, when the responsible parties dumped and spread hazardous materials from recycled waste oil operations in the Uplands Area portion of the site. The responsible partie also constructed lagoons in the Uplands Area and used them to store reprocessed waste oil. Under several owners, these facilities were allowed to degenerate, leaving several waste oil lagoons containing residual oil sludges and aqueous wastes, contaminated waste piles, drummed wastes, and areas of contaminated soil resulting from associated waste oil reprocessing activities. In addition to the oil reprocessing activities, the site was also the former location of a landfill and dump, located north of the Uplands Area. These activities have resulted in surface water, sediment, and soil contamination. Immediate cleanup actions to protect human health and the environment have been completed. Long-term monitoring is ongoing.

Uncontrolled discharges from the Uplands Area waste sources have resulted in surface water and soil contamination moving downstream into the adjoining Westerly Wetlands. The Westerly Wetlands is located in a groundwater discharge area of the Englishtown Aquifer, where groundwater flows to the surface and ultimately drains into Deep Run via Burnt Fly Brook. The nearest people are located about 1,000 feet away from the site and the nearest well is 200 feet away. An auto salvage yard, a few residences, and a horse farm are located nearby.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

  
EPA selected a remedy to clean up the Uplands Area in November 1983 which included: (1) excavating hazardous substances in lagoon 1, the asphalt pile area, the tar patch area, and the drummed waste area (2) excavating and removing hazardous materials in lagoons 2, 3, and 4 and contaminated soil in other areas (4) excavation and removal of sludge contaminated with high levels of PCBs for off-site incineration; (5) restoring the original site contours and replanting the area; (6) designing a comprehensive five-year groundwater monitoring program and testing eight residential wells; and (7) studying the Westerly Wetlands further to determine the extent of contamination there. All of the contaminated soil and sludge from the Uplands Area has been excavated. Nearly 85,000 tons of contaminated soil, including about 10,000 tons of stabilized sludge, have been removed and disposed of off-site at EPA-approved disposal facilities. In addition, about 1,000 tons of sludge contaminated with high levels of PCBs have been removed and incinerated off site. After backfilling the excavated area, a ten-acre clay cap was constructed and six inches of topsoil were placed on top of this clay layer. The cap was primarily added to prevent erosion and restore contours and provides additional protection from lead and PCBs remaining at the site, including preventing infiltration of any residual soil contamination into groundwater. The Uplands Area is now covered by a field of tall grass above the cap. Work on the Uplands Area finished in 1993.

In September 1988, EPA selected an interim remedy for the Westerly Wetlands. It included: (1) removing about 6,000 cubic yards of contaminated materials that migrated through the Westerly Wetlands to the Downstream Area; (2) disposing of these materials in the same manner in which Uplands Area wastes were handled; (3) containing the contaminated soil and sediment in the Westerly Wetlands by means of a sedimentation basin and appropriate diversion controls; and (4) putting in security fencing and an access road into the Westerly Wetlands from Spring Valley Road. About 6,000 tons of PCB-contaminated soil was dug up and removed from the portion of the Westerly Wetlands referred to as the Downstream Area. A sedimentation basin was completed in the Downstream Area to prevent sediment from migrating off site into Burnt Fly Brook. These actions, in conjunction with the State’s periodic removal of sediment accumulating in the basin, will mitigate the effects of the site on downstream potable watershed areas. All construction work was substantially completed in 1996. Based on monitoring data obtained since the sedimentation basin was completed, surface water and sediment contamination levels in Burnt Fly Brook have been significantly reduced and have not migrated off-site.

In September 1998, EPA selected the Final Remedy for the site. The Final Remedy covers three areas at the site – the Westerly Wetlands, the Tar Patch Area and the Northerly Wetlands Area. The selected remedy required digging up and disposing of PCB- and lead-contaminated soil from the Tar Patch Area and the Northerly Wetlands off site, with subsequent wetlands restoration. The Tar Patch Area and the Northerly Wetlands Area are portions of the site in and near the Uplands Area. Specifically, 46,000 tons of contaminated soil from the Tar Patch Area were dug up and transported off site for disposal. In addition, about 600 tons of “hot spot” material was dug up from the Tar Patch Area and transported off site for incineration. From the Northerly Wetlands Area, about 9,400 tons of contaminated soil was dug up and transported off site for disposal. The Northerly Wetlands was also restored. The Westerly Wetlands provides habitat to a greater diversity of wildlife than any of the other habitats on the site. Therefore, remediation via excavation of the Westerly Wetlands would cause significant ecological impacts to this area and it is uncertain if these wetlands could be restored. The selected remedy, however, is expected to result in a long-term sediment buildup from vegetative humification, forming an increasingly protective barrier over the contaminated soil in the Westerly Wetlands. The selected remedy will preserve the existing wetland system and require monitoring of the natural protective barrier as it continues to develop and increase protectiveness. Surface water and sediment in Burnt Fly Brook are monitored to ensure that on-site contamination does not reach the Brook. The site achieved construction completion status when the Preliminary Close-Out Report was signed in September 2004.

  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted five, five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and that the remedies function as intended by site decision documents. The fifth review, completed in 2021, found that the remedies at the site protect human health and the environment. Contaminated soils and sediments have been dug up, the sedimentation basin prevents migration of the contaminants into surface water, and site access is restricted by fencing. For the site’s remedy to be protective in the long term, institutional controls, i.e. deed notices, need to be put in place. Five properties in Marlboro Township and nine properties in Old Bridge require deed notices under the ROD. Two deed restriction notices were filed in accordance with the United States/State of New Jersey versus Dominick Manzo Consent Decree entered in 2011. Marlboro Township filed their five deed restriction notices in 2013. However, the remaining deed restrictions for Old Bridge are still not completed.

In 2016, based on the monitoring and Base Line Ecological Risk Assessment (BERA) results, EPA initiated optimization of the final remedy to evaluate the potential for reduction or elimination of the availability of the lead waste in the Westerly Wetlands portion of the site through a treatability study. An EPA contractor tested several amendments in the lab and determined that one will most effectively reduce the availability of lead at the site. The amendments were determined to be successful. The contractor, with EPA oversight, then tested amendment applications in the field to determine if these amendments will work at the site. This pilot study was completed in 2021. EPA is now preparing to apply an amendment at a larger scale at the site.

In 2021, EPA Region 2 also began working with lead experts at EPA's Office of Research and Development to provide additional sampling and analysis of the lead at the site. ORD visited the site and collected samples in 2021 and will visit the site again in April 2022.
