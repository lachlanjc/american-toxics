### Background

The Chemical Insecticide Corp. site was a 5.7-acre area located in Edison Township, New Jersey. Chemical Insecticide Corporation (CIC) owned and operated an industrial facility at the site from 1954 to 1970. It formulated or manufactured insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides and herbicides. These activities led to widespread chemical contamination on the former CIC property as well as migration of contaminants off site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Due to the complexity of the nature and extent of contamination, the site cleanup was divided into four phases referred to as operable units. The cleanup of Operable Unit (OU) OU1 was an interim action taken to control contaminated runoff from the CIC property; OU2 clean up addressed surface and subsurface soils at the CIC property; the OU3 cleanup addressed soil and sediment in off-site creek areas; and OU4 continues to address contaminated groundwater associated with the site.

OU1 cleanup activities included installation of perimeter fencing, a temporary cap and a surface water drainage system and was completed in 1994. The OU1 cleanup was designed to be temporary with the objective to control potential exposure to contamination at the site while a permanent remedy, OU2, was being developed.

The OU2 cleanup involved the excavation, removal and off-site disposal of approximately 241,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil. Excavation depths reached approximately 20 feet below ground surface in some areas. These deeper excavations removed contaminated soils considered to be sources of groundwater contamination. After excavation was completed in 2005, the site was backfilled to grade with clean soil and restored with natural vegetation.

The OU3 cleanup was completed in 1997. Under OU3, 13,800 cubic yards of contaminated soil and sediment was excavated and sent off-site for disposal. Restoration of affected areas, including stream beds, and wetlands. Post-excavation sampling results confirmed that cleanup goals were achieved.

The OU4 site-related groundwater contamination is being monitored. The groundwater contaminant plume is stable and all surrounding industries and businesses located above the residual groundwater contamination are connected to public water.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

All planned actions have been completed at the site. Long-term groundwater monitoring is on-going. Groundwater monitoring indicates that levels of groundwater contaminants have decreased following the OU2 soil cleanup. A five-year review of the site was completed in January 2024 and determined the remedy remains protective of human health and the environment.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Additional protective measures taken at the site include the application of institutional controls which serve to limit the use of groundwater at the site. A Classification Exception Area and Well Restriction Area was established in 2009 to restrict water use within the extent of the residual groundwater contamination.

### Sampling and Monitoring

A long-term groundwater monitoring plan continues to be carried out. The plan is designed to monitor the groundwater contamination levels in the overburden and bedrock aquifers below and adjacent to the site.
