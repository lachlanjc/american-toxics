Background
The Creese & Cook (Former) Tannery (Site) is located in Danvers, Massachusetts. Leather tanning operations on site led to contamination of surface and subsurface soils with tannery wastes, and contaminants exceeded state health-based standards in multiple locations. The Site was used for maufacturing and disposal of hazardous substances from about 1903 until early 1981. Three parcels of land at the Site were at one time owned by the Creese and Cook Tannery Co., which operated a tannery and finishing facility onsite. Leather tanning and finishing operations began in 1903 at the 33 Water Street parcel, on the East Study Area (ESA), which is located east of the Crane River. In 1914 most operations, except for finishing operations and offices, moved to a larger new beam house facility at 55 Clinton Avenue, on the West Study Area (WSA), which is located west of the Crane River.  Creese & Cook used raw animal hides to produce leather shoes, handbags, gloves, and garment leather, primarily from cowhide stock. The tannery continued to operate on both sides of Crane River until 1981. Hebb Leather also operated at the Site for a short period after. Both Creese & Cook and Hebb Leather each filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions in 1982. Wastes from tanning operations were disposed of in two landfills on the 55 Clinton Avenue property. Liquid effluent wastes from the manufacturing process were discharged to the Crane River until 1975 and later to sewers, while sludge waste was deposited in an on-site lagoon system. EPA added the site to the Superfund Program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in May 2013.  EPA issued a Record of Decision for the cleanup of the West Study and East Study Areas of the Site in July of 2019.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Since the mid-1980s, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (“MassDEP”) oversaw numerous investigations and response actions at some of the properties that comprise the Site, including fencing of Imminent Hazard Areas which contain high levels of arsenic in soil, and the construction of a waste disposal cell at the 55 Clinton Avenue parcel. However, MassDEP eventually requested that EPA evaluate these properties to determine if the area would become eligible for inclusion on the National Priorities List (“NPL”).  The Site was proposed for inclusion on the NPL in September 2012 and included in the final listing of NPL sites in 2013. In addition, in 2012, EPA conducted a removal action and removed 450 tons of arsenic-contaminated soil at 33 Water Street to address arsenic in the soil adjacent to condominium building D.  From 2014 to 2017, EPA conducted extensive sampling and completed a Remedial Investigation (RI), an ecological risk assessment and a human health risk assessment and a Feasability Study for both the west and east study areas.  EPA issued a Record of Decision in July of 2019, to document EPA's clean-up actions for the East and West Study Areas at the Site. The major elements of a removal action were performed by EPA at 45 Water Street from 2020 to 2021. Approximately 2,600 tons of contaminated soil were excavated and properly disposed of off-site. Shoreline restoration activities are expected to continue through summer 2024. Performance of a second EPA removal action began at 33 Water Street in 2021 and is ongoing. Approximately 2,400 tons of contaminated soil have been excavated and properly disposed of off-site. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
The removal action at 45 Water Street was completed and the removal action at 33 Water Street is continuing, with the final phase anticipated in summer of 2024. In summer 2024, EPA intends to award a construction contract for the remediation of OU1 and OU2, other than 33 and 45 Water Street. The site contactor expects to complete the field portion of the work in late 2025. EPA will continue to provide community updates and/or hold a public meeting before excavation and major construction work begins. The Crane River, or OU3, EPA has commissioned a remedial investigation, set to begin in late 2024. The study will include sampling of surface water, sediment, and biota (fish and shellfish tissue) to determine if there are human health (from fish consumption) or ecological concerns with the river system. The study will also include surveying and mapping activities as well as inspections by wetland biologists. The work will primarily be in the river itself but will affect the tidal edges as well. Once the remedial investigation is complete, there will be additional opportunities for public comment on strategies to address any human health or ecological risks in this area. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Institutional controls are required for this site.
This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.
The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above. To contact EPA regarding Institutional Controls and/or activity and use limitations, please complete this form. ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
Disclaimer: This information is being provided by EPA as an informational tool to further assist the public in determining the types of restrictions that may be in place at National Priorities List sites being addressed by EPA under the Superfund program. In addition to the areas addressed by the institutional controls identified on this web site there may be other areas on the property that require restrictions on use of the property that are not captured in this EPA database. States and other entities may have implemented laws or restrictions applicable to this site. The information provided herein does not replace a title search or meet "All Appropriate Inquiry" requirements. U.S. EPA encourages users to review the Site files to obtain information regarding remedy components, containment systems and the land use for which cleanup standards were selected for these sites. More information and links can be found in the Institutional Control instrument collection of document, above, and the EPA regional offices may also be contacted. Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
Pre﻿-design soil sampling was completed in 2020 to support and develop the Remedial Design (RD) and Remedial Action (RA). The RD was finalized in 2023 and EPA is currently reviewing bids for the RA.

Emergency Response and Removal
In 2012, EPA conducted a removal action to excavate and properly dispose of 450 tons of arsenic-contaminated soil at 33 Water Street to address arsenic in soil which posed an imminent hazard. The major elements of a second EPA removal action began at 33 Water Street in 2021 and is currently ongoing. Approximately 2,400 tons of contaminated soil have been excavated and properly disposed of off-site.   The a removal action wasperformed by EPA at 45 Water Street from 2020 to 2021. Approximately 2,600 tons of contaminated soil were excavated and properly disposed of off-site. Shoreline restoration activities are expected to continue through summer 2024. Top of Page
Enforcement Information
EPA is currently investigating past and current property owners, as well as previous developers, to determine potential liability for conducting clean-up actvities and for payment of past response costs at the Site.
