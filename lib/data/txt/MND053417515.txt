### Background

The 183-acre Boise Cascade/Onan Corp./Medtronics, Inc. site is located in Fridley, Minnesota. Wood-treating operations took place on site from 1921 to 1961. Operations contaminated soil, sediments, soil vapor and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. The Onan Corporation acquired 133 acres of the Boise Cascade property and Medtronics purchased the remaining 50 acres. The new owners acquired the property to build commercial and manufacturing facilities on site. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1995.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

At the Onan Corporation property, the site’s long-term remedy included excavation and on-site containment of contaminated soil as well as groundwater extraction and treatment. At the Medtronics property, the site’s long-term remedy included excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil, groundwater treatment and off-site disposal of 5,000 gallons of oil. Long-term groundwater monitoring is taking place at both properties. Cleanup finished in 1992. EPA took the site off the NPL in 1995.

Later redevelopment activities at the site resulted in the detection of additional areas of contamination. In 1999, a removal action, or short-term cleanup, disposed of drums and soil. Two years of groundwater monitoring followed. In 2009, soil removal took place in another location, followed by the construction of slab-on-grade building to cover remaining contaminated soil. A vapor barrier and venting system at the building protects people from vapor intrusion.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Organics, especially creosote and phenols, were the main contaminants.
