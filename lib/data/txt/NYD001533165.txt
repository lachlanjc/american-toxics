Background
Operations at the SMS site began in early 1967 when Sol Schusheim rented the property from Marcus Associates of Farmingdale, New York. In September 1973, Mr. Schusheim purchased SMS Instruments, Inc., from Ogden Technology and, later that year, purchased the property at 120 Marcus Boulevard in Deer Park. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) discovered three sources of groundwater and soil contamination at the site. A major source of contamination was a “leaching” pool on the south side of the building where SMS Instruments regularly discharged industrial waste generated from degreasing and other metal refurbishing operations. In May 1980, an SMS contractor removed about 800 gallons of waste from the leaching pool, filled the pool with sand, and filled the discharge drains and pipes with concrete. The second major source of contamination was a 6,000-gallon underground storage tank (UST) used to store jet fuel until 1981. In February 1988, SMS Instruments removed the UST during an investigation. The third source of surface soil contamination came from leaking waste drums stored in the back lot of the site property, east of the building. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in June 1986.
EPA completed the site’s long-term cleanup and deleted the site from the NPL in September 2010.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Immediate Actions: Work began in 1983 when an SMS Instruments contractor pumped contaminated liquids out of the leaching pool, filled it with sand, and sealed it. SMS Instruments removed a leaking underground jet fuel storage tank in 1988. Finally, in 1995, EPA removed leaking waste drums from the site for offsite disposal. Long-term Cleanup: The EPA’s 1989 cleanup plan for contaminated groundwater and soil called for extracting and treating groundwater through air stripping before reinjecting the treated water back into the aquifer. Air stripping is the process of moving air through contaminated groundwater water in an above-ground treatment system with the goal of evaporating and removing volatile organic compounds. EPA later revised this plan to allow for treated groundwater to be discharged directly into a basin next to the site. EPA treated soil using in-place soil vapor extraction (SVE). SVE is a cleanup technique that removes harmful chemicals from soil by extracting them in vapor form with a vacuum and then filtering the vapors through carbon filters to remove contaminants. The SVE unit operated from April 1992 until all soil cleanup goals were achieved in November 1993. After cleanup, EPA removed the soil treatment unit in 1994. EPA finished constructing a groundwater treatment plant in June 1994. The system, which operated from June 1994 to September 2005, treated contaminated groundwater until contaminant concentrations in discharged water were consistently below required levels. In July 2005, EPA transferred all operation and maintenance responsibilities at the site to NYSDEC and in December 2007, NYSDEC dismantled the groundwater treatment system and disposed of the materials off-site. EPA issued the third and final five-year review in July 2006. EPA also installed an air sparging system in May 2005 to clean up residual contamination in soil above and below the water table. Air sparging is the process of injecting air directly into contaminated groundwater. The injected air creates bubbles that rise and carry volatized contaminants through the soil so they can be extracted. As a result of the operation of the system, contaminant levels decreased in the groundwater and, in January 2010, NYSDEC turned off the air sparing operation. Off-site Contamination: EPA began an investigation in May 1990 to determine the nature and extent of groundwater contamination upgradient (against the flow of groundwater) of the site. The field work finished in December 1992. The study indicated that groundwater contamination had not spread off site and no further action was needed. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA completed site cleanup and took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 2010.
