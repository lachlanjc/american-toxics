### Background

The 120-acre American Creosote Works, Inc. (ACW) [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located off Highway 15 at the intersection of South Railroad Avenue and Baremore Street in Louisville, Mississippi. The site includes the area where a wood treating facility that pressure-treated wood products with creosote oil and coal tar solutions operated from 1912 until 1997. Until the early 1980s, the facility discharged waste into three ponds on site.

The site is vacant and overgrown with scattered to dense vegetated areas. Railroad Lake covers approximately seven acres on the northern part of the site. South Railroad Avenue borders the site to the east. Hughes Creek and a residential neighborhood, which includes low-income residents, border the site to the west. Site surroundings include industrial, commercial and residential land uses.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 2001 EPA because of contaminated groundwater, sediment and soil resulting from facility operations. The State of Mississippi owns most of the site property.

The [Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ)](https://www.mdeq.ms.gov/) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. A water line connects residents and businesses to the public water system. By conducting cleanup activities, EPA, MDEQ and USACE continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination. The site achieved Site Wide Ready for Anticipated Use in August 2021 with the City, EPA and MDEQ Signing the Enviromental Covenants on the parcels to ensure protection of the remedy. Per the NCP, five year reviews will be conducted to review the effectiveness of the remedy for the life of the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA leads site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with MDEQ and USACE.

**1984 – 1985**  
EPA conducted short-term cleanup activities for the two waste pond areas on site. EPA removed and solidified 70,000 cubic yards of waste and contaminated soil and placed it in an unlined storage area on site. EPA then covered the unlined storage area with 2-to-3 feet of clay. EPA built the clay cap so surface water flows around the storage cell, placed topsoil on the cap and seeded the area with grass.

**1999 - 2000**  
EPA conducted additional cleanup activities to address waste and tanks abandoned on site. EPA decommissioned 20 tanks, treated 176,000 gallons of wastewater, recycled 192 tons of metal, disposed of 200 tons of hazardous debris and 60 tons of nonhazardous debris, transported nine lab packs off site for disposal, and stockpiled 4,000 cubic yards of solidified waste for on-site disposal. EPA constructed a temporary storage area for the waste.

**2001**  
EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List (NPL) in 2001 because of contaminated ground water, sediment and soil resulting from facility operations. EPA, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination.

**2006**  
In 2006 and 2007, EPA began cleanup activities to address contamination in Hughes Creek just north of Baremore Street. EPA installed a retaining wall next to the creek.

**2007**  
In 2007, EPA issued the cleanup plan (a Record of Decision, or ROD) for the site to address remaining soil and groundwater contamination.

**2012**  
EPA initiated final Remedial activities in 2012 with the installation of a subsurface vertical barrier wall and cap system to contain contaminated soil/sediment. This work was completed in 2015.

**2015 - 2016**  
A Removal action was conducted in late 2015 through late 2016 to address remaining subsurface creosote located below the former creek bed.

**2017**  
Cleanup activities have been completed. A [Five-Year Review](http://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11069998.pdf) was completed in 2017.

**2021**

The site achieved Site Wide Ready for Anticipated Use (SWRAU) in August 2021 with the City, EPA and MDEQ Signing the Enviromental Covenants on the parcels to ensure protection of the remedy.

**2022**

The [2022 Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11173688.pdf) was completed on August 9, 2022, which found that the site is protective in the short-term.

However, in order for the remedy to be protective in the long-term, the following actions need to be taken:

- Ensure the Site is secure and trespassing is deterred.
- Evaluate removing the pine tree growing on the containment cell’s cover.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [2022 Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11173688.pdf) was completed on August 9, 2022. The remedy at the Site currently protects human health and the environment in the short term because contaminated source material was excavated and consolidated within the cell, there are no current exposures to contaminated media and Institutional Controls are in place to limit land use activities on site to commercial and industrial land uses and to prohibit access to groundwater.

EPA has determined that the site is available for commercial and industrial redevelopment that is compatible with the site remedy.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

A water line connects residents and businesses to the public water system.

The site achieved Site Wide Ready for Anticipated Use in August 2021 with the City, EPA and MDEQ Signing the Enviromental Covenants on the parcels to ensure protection of the remedy. The August 2021 Environmental Covenant places institutional controls on the site property to limit land use activities on Site to commercial and industrial land uses, protect the remedy implemented and to prohibit access to potentially contaminated groundwater.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA has been unable to identify any viable potentially responsible parties for the site. EPA will use federal funds for site cleanup activities. The State of Mississippi will also fund 10 percent of site cleanup costs.
