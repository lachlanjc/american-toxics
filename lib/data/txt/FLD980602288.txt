### Background

Broward County,the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP), operated a waste management facility from 1964 to 1987. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983 because of contaminated groundwater, sludge and soil resulting from facility operations. EPA, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and Broward County, have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2006.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983 because of contaminated groundwater, sludge and soil resulting from facility operations. EPA, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and Broward County (PRP), have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. Broward County, led site investigation and cleanup activities under the Superfund program, with oversight provided by the EPA and FDEP. Broward County, continues to perform landfill closure activities under the RCRA program, with oversight provided by FDEP.

Site investigations and clean-up activities have focused on two areas, which the EPA refers to as operable units (OUs). These areas include OU-1:source control of contamination from the sludge lagoon; and OU-2: identification of any additional hot spots at the site and cleanup of groundwater, as necessary. In 1985, the EPA issued a cleanup plan (a Record of Decision, or ROD) for OU-1. In 1989, Broward County dug up, dewatered and stabilized contaminated sludge from the lagoon, placed it in a cell in the sanitary landfill, and constructed a cap over the cell with a protective cover. Broward County also provided connections to the public water supply system for affected residences near the site while performing groundwater contamination studies. Between September 2000 and September 2003, site groundwater met cleanup standards for seven sampling events in a row. In 2006, the EPA deleted the site from the NPL.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Broward County, the site’s PRP, led site investigation and cleanup activities under the Superfund program, with oversight provided by EPA and FDEP. Broward County continues to perform landfill closure activities under the RCRA program, with oversight provided by FDEP.

Broward County also provided connections to the public water supply system for affected residences near the site while performing groundwater contamination studies.

September 2000- September 2003, site groundwater met cleanup standards for seven sampling events in a row.

2006, EPA took the site off the NPL. Broward County continued to monitor groundwater. Between 2005 and 2010, two nearby wells slightly exceeded the vinyl chloride cleanup goal periodically.

EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews (FYRs) of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies continue to protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review, completed in 2011, concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

In 2011, Broward County demonstrated that groundwater had met drinking water standards for two straight sampling events. As a result, EPA no longer requires FYRs for the site. FDEP will continue to monitor groundwater under the state’s RCRA program. EPA does not anticipate additional work at the site under the Superfund program.

### Sampling and Monitoring

After NPL Deletion, Broward County continued to perform ground-monitoring. Between 2005 and 2010, two nearby wells slightly exceeded the vinyl chloride clean-up goal periodically. Landfill closure activities required by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), including regular groundwater monitoring, are ongoing. The site’s fourth FYR, completed in 2011, found that the site’s clean-up approach continues to protect people and the environment from remaining site contamination. In 2011, Broward County demonstrated that groundwater had met drinking water standards for two straight sampling events. As a result, the EPA no longer requires FYRs for the site. EPA does not anticipate additional work at the site under the Superfund program.

### Enforcement Information

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRP to investigate and clean up the site.
