### Background

The A & F Material Reclaiming, Inc., site covers nearly 4 acres near Greenup, Illinois. A recycling plant operated on site from 1977 to 1980. It processed waste materials such as oil, sludge and sulfuric acid into fuel oil and fire retardant chemicals. There were many violations of Illinois EPA operating permits. At one point, four storage lagoons overflowed, contaminating surrounding soil and the water drainage pathway to the Embarras River. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2012.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Cleanup actions in 1983 and 1984 to protect human health and the environment included lowering the level of wastes in the lagoons; diking; trenching; removing drums, contaminated soils, sediments and wastes off site; disposing of buildings and equipment; final site grading; and air and ground water monitoring. A temporary cap covered part of the consolidated sludge on site. As of 2010, all ground water cleanup levels have been attained. Ground water monitoring is no longer required.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The third and final review in 2010 concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

EPA placed the site on the NPL in 1983. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in June 2012.  

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The remedial investigation report did not include a formal baseline risk assessment. Since the lagoon sludge, wastewater and oil, along with tank waste, were removed under the Interim Remedial Measure, they posed no environmental impacts or adverse health effects to the neighboring community. The primary concerns associated with the site were with respect to the soil, sediment, groundwater and surface water.

Soils in the area of the tank farm were contaminated and posed an environmental threat. Several sediment samples taken from the drainage ditch showed low levels of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), but sediments from the river did not have any substantial contamination. Neither the drainage ditch nor the river showed any contamination above background levels.

Data from groundwater wells showed elevated levels of sulfate, total dissolved solids (TDS), and oil and grease. Additionally, several metals were detected at levels higher than background and in some cases higher than the Illinois EPA standard for groundwater. Because of the dilution effect between the groundwater and surface water, it was expected that the contaminated groundwater would not cause contamination in the river. Also, the planned removal of contaminated materials from the site would remove the primary source of contamination to the groundwater. The remedial investigation concluded there was a high flow rate through the sand and gravel aquifer, which would allow for rapid flushing of any residual contaminants.

### Enforcement Information

On September 12, 1984, a Partial Consent Decree was entered into by four of the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) which outlined a remedial action plan that included a phased approach for cleaning up the Site. The first phase included the remedial
