Background
The 11-acre Whiteford Sales & Service Inc./Nationalease Superfund site is located in South Bend, Indiana. From 1967 to 1983, a truck washing and leasing company operated on site. Detergents and solvents used by the operation were discharged to three dry wells on site, contaminating soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1996.
