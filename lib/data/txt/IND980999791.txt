### Background

The 11-acre Whiteford Sales & Service Inc./Nationalease Superfund site is located in South Bend, Indiana. From 1967 to 1983, a truck washing and leasing company operated on site. Detergents and solvents used by the operation were discharged to three dry wells on site, contaminating soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1996.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions under state and federal oversight.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s cleanup included the removal and off-site disposal of sludge and surrounding contaminated soil from the site’s three dry wells. Removal of the material finished in July 1988. About 210 cubic yards of contaminated material were properly disposed of off site.

After follow-up investigations and a risk assessment, EPA determined that the cleanup had eliminated the health threats posed by the site and that no further cleanup actions were necessary. EPA selected a “No Further Action” remedy for the site and took it off the NPL in 1996. EPA placed the site on the NPL in 1990.
