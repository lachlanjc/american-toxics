### Background

The Jervis B. Webb Co. site is located in a mixed industrial, commercial and residential area in South Gate, California. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including trichloroethene (TCE), have been confirmed in the soils and groundwater at the site. Industrial conveyor belt systems were manufactured from the 1950s to early 1996 on the southeast portion of the site. Aluminum and stainless steel aircraft rivets were produced on the northwest portion of the site, until about 1981. Site investigations and cleanup planning are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA completed characterization of environmental media for the site in several efforts from 2013 to 2017 with the collection of soil, soil gas, groundwater, and air samples. The Remedial Investigation (RI) report describing this work will be completed in summer, 2019.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA listed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2012. Adding the site to the NPL enables EPA to study site conditions further, identify possible sources of contamination and develop a comprehensive strategy to address all locations and sources of VOC contamination.

The site’s remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) are ongoing. The remedial investigation looks at the nature and extent of contamination. The feasibility study looks at how cleanup can be conducted safely, effectively and in compliance with state and federal laws. EPA will use results from the RI/FS to develop a long-term cleanup plan.

The preferred remedy and remedial action objectives will be described in a Proposed Plan, which will be published in a fact sheet and distributed to the community. The Proposed Plan provides for a public comment period and community meeting. The selected remedy is then documented in a Record of Decision, which is implemented in the remedial design and remedial action at the site.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site activities have also included a removal action, or short-term cleanup, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1997, TCE was detected in on-site soils and the contaminated soil was excavated, removed and backfilled with clean material in 1999.
