Background
The 200-acre Annapolis Lead Mine Site is located near Annapolis, Missouri. Lead mining activities from 1919 to 1940 generated over one million tons of mining wastes, contaminating soils and sediments with heavy metals, primarily lead. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site was addressed through federal and state actions. The EPA’s next Five-Year Review of the site’s remedy is scheduled to be completed by 2027. The EPA has conducted three Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. The third review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy is protective of human health and the environment in the long term. The third Five-Year Review began on September 29, 2021 and was completed on July 26, 2022. Current actions are routine maintenance of the repository and inspection of Institutional Controls.
What Is the Current Site Status?
The short-term remedy under the Removal Program included excavation and containment of contaminated soils. The long-term remedy under the Remedial Program consisted of in-stream stabilization techniques to prevent heavy metals from washing into the river along with additional stabilization of the historical mining area. Institutional controls to regulate the use of contaminated soils and development on the site are implemented.  The site is ready for anticipated use. ﻿The site was deleted from the NPL on September 30, 2020.
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Site-wide Institutional Controls include the following: Environmental Covenants and Deed Notices with owners of properties with residual contamination in non-residential areas. Institutional Controls are complete.
Sampling and Monitoring
Please see RODs and Five-Year Reviews.
