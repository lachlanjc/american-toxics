### Background

The Highway 3 PCE site is located in Le Mars, Plymouth County, Iowa. The site consists of several square blocks in downtown Le Mars, Iowa. PCE and its associated degradation products have been identified in soil, groundwater, sub-slab vapors and indoor air underneath and/or within several businesses/structures at the site. The contamination originates from historic dry cleaning services at 18 Plymouth Street SE (east of the intersection of Plymouth Street SE, also identified as Highway 3, and Central Avenue). PCE is an ingredient in dry cleaning chemicals and releases of this compound into the environment has been a common occurrence throughout the United States. The approximate geographic coordinates at the center of the dry cleaning services building are 42.792879 degrees north latitude and 96.165873 degrees west longitude.

The site was discovered in April 2008 when environmental investigation activities related to the nearby Le Mars Coal Gas Plant ( [https://response.epa.gov/site/site\_profile.aspx?site\_id=O7YH](https://response.epa.gov/site/site_profile.aspx?site_id=O7YH) ) site identified the presence of tetrachloroethene (PCE) in groundwater monitoring wells downgradient of the coal gas plant. PCE is not a contaminant often associated with coal gas plants. Subsequent groundwater sampling events further delineated the extent of the PCE groundwater plume and traced the migration pathway to potential source areas. The Highway 3 PCE site was identified as a potentially hazardous waste site and entered into the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Information System (CERCLIS), later replaced by the Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS) under Identification Number IAN000706042. The commercial property at 18 Plymouth Street SE is currently occupied by a dry cleaning business. The business, however, is now used for drop-off and pickup services only. All dry cleaning activities are now performed at an off-site location.

Multiple activities have been conducted at the site since the 2008 site discovery and the subsequent groundwater sampling delineation efforts. Activities at the site include: A Preliminary Assessment (PA) in 2011; a Removal Assessment and Removal Action (vapor mitigation systems installations) in 2013-2014; an additional Removal Assessment in 2015; Supplemental Removal Assessment activities in 2016; additional Supplemental Removal Assessment activities in 2017; a Site Inspection in 2018; a Supplemental Removal Action (energy recovery ventilation system) and Removal Assessment activities in 2018; and a final Removal Action (excavation and disposal) in 2021.

The Removal Assessments, Removal Actions, supplemental activities and Site Inspection work were conducted to identify the location and extent of PCE (and associated degradation products) contamination in all potentially impacted media (soil, groundwater, sub-slab vapors and indoor air) and to mitigate threats to human health and the environment. Environmental sampling activities associated with the assessments and actions generally consisted of: Soil gas sampling; Sub-slab vapor sampling; Indoor air sampling; Groundwater sampling; and subsurface soil sampling. Environmental sampling was conducted at the dry cleaning building located at 18 Plymouth Street SE (dry cleaning building) and adjacent/downgradient buildings where previous groundwater delineation efforts had identified the presence of the PCE (and associated degradation products) plume. Environmental sampling and laboratory analyses identified PCE (and associated degradation products) in all media (soil gas, soil, sub-slab vapors, indoor air and groundwater) above respective protective levels (e.g., Superfund Chemical Data Matrix benchmarks, Safe Drinking Water Act - Maximum Contaminant Levels or (MCLs), and site specific Removal Action Levels (RALs).

The Removal Assessments evaluated sub-slab vapors and indoor air for 69 buildings near the PCE source areas or overlying the PCE plume. 20 buildings (containing 21 businesses) had vapor intrusion (VI) issues from PCE that exceeded protective levels. The EPA installed vapor mitigation systems (VMS) in each of these buildings under a Removal Action in 2014 and 2015. Additional investigation of soil and groundwater at the dry cleaning building was conducted following installation of VMS. Laboratory analysis of soil and groundwater samples collected at the dry cleaning building determined multiple locations along/underneath the building were impacted with PCE contamination above RAL for soil and/or the MCL for groundwater. The collective results of the Removal Assessments/supplements and Removal Action/supplements (vapor mitigation systems) provided information for conducting a Site Inspection (SI) in 2018 involving further collection of indoor air, ambient air, sub-slab vapor and groundwater (including private well) samples. The general objectives of the SI were to delineate the extent of groundwater contamination and assess inhalation threats posed to residents, students and workers who occupy structures overlying the groundwater plume. Results from the SI concluded that threats presented by the release of hazardous substances at the dry cleaning building, and the number of people actually or potentially impacted by the release, may be sufficient to warrant consideration for inclusion of the site on the EPA's NPL.

An additional Removal Action (demolition and source material removal of 690.4 tons of contaminated soil via excavation and proper landfill disposal) was conducted in 2021. The EPA also performed indoor air sampling and evaluated the performance of the installed VMS at the site. PCE was not detected in indoor air at concentrations above applicable RALs. The VMS were determined to be functioning as designed and are protective of human health. The site was proposed for the NPL on March 18, 2022. The EPA received no comments during the 60-Day Public Comment period and the Agency formally listed the on the NPL on September 9, 2022.

An EPA contract was awarded in May 2023 for a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study. Field work for the Remedial Investigation commenced in February 2024 following the development of work plans, health and safety plans, and Quality Assurance Project Plans. Vapor mitigation system inspections, vapor intrusion sampling, and soil and groundwater investigations were conducted during Spring 2024. Phase 1 of the Remedial Investigation was completed on May 17, 2024, and laboratory analyses, reporting and data interpretation were completed during summer 2024. Phase II of the Remedial Investigation will begin the week of February 17, 2025. Additional soil and groundwater samples will be collected to further delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of contamination. The laboratory results from Phase II of the Remedial Investigation will inform the placement of permanent monitoring wells and whether additional soil/groundwater delineation is necessary.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The 2013-2014 Removal Assessment evaluated 69 buildings adjacent to the contamination source areas (or above the contaminated groundwater plume). 20 buildings (21 businesses) were found to have concentrations of PCE and/or Trichloroethene (TCE) that exceeded their Removal Action levels. Vapor mitigation ystems were installed under a Removal Action during 2013-2014 in the 20 buildings (21 businesses), which exceeded respective contaminant Removal Action levels. The vapor mitigation systems are functioning as designed and remain protective of human health as of the last indoor air sampling event in 2021.

Source removal via excavation of contaminated soil was conducted under a 2021 Removal Action. Prior to commencing Removal Action activities, which also required demolition of some existing structures, the EPA consulted with the Iowa State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). The Iowa SHPO completed a historical review and determined that no adverse effects were anticipated as a result of the planned Removal Action. An asbestos survey was completed prior to proposed demolition/removal activities. No action related to potential asbestos removal was warranted based on the survey/sampling results collected for the buildings planned for demolition.

The EPA Region 7 Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS) contractor, Environmental Restoration LLC (ER), conducted demolition activities during May 2021. ER utilized an excavator to demolish the south addition (~400 square feet) and southwest addition (~525 square feet) of the current dry cleaning building. The debris was segregated and loaded into trucks for transportation to the disposal sites.

Removal of contaminated soil via excavation commenced following the demolition of the buidling additions on the southern portion of the current dry cleaning building. ER conducted excavation activities and utilized slide-rail shoring systems due to the proximity to the main structure of the current dry cleaning building and the required depth. A 20- x 32-foot area was excavated to a depth of 16 feet and an additional 15- x 20-foot excavation to a depth of 5 feet (with an 8 feet deep pothole in the center) was completed east of the initial excavation. A photoionization detector (PID) was utilized during the excavation activities to screen subsurface soils for contamination and steer removal activities. Post-excavation confirmation samples were collected and delivered to a fixed-laboratory for analysis of PCE and TCE. Laboratory analytical results identified PCE concentrations in two of the five soil samples collected at the maximum excavation depth that exceeded the EPA RAL of 60 micrograms per kilogram. The two samples had been collected within the western portion of the excavation at 16 feet below ground surface (bgs). Excavation activities did no proceed beyond 16 feet below ground surface (bgs) due to exceeding the depth of the contractor's limit. 275 gallons of sodium permanganate was applied to the excavation to promote dechlorination (breakdown) of the PCE and associated degradation products in areas where confirmation sampling identified source areas remaining in place.

The excavation pits were backfilled with soil from a nearby borrow source. The borrow soil was sampled and analyzed for metals, herbicides and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) prior to use as a fill material in order to confirm it was free of contaminants above levels of concern. Backfill was completed, and the surface of the entire excavated areas was finished with crushed concrete and graded to ensure proper drainage.

Contaminated soil was loaded into side-dump trailers for transportation to LP Gill Landfill in Jackson, Nebraska under waste authorization number LPG21007. The soil was classified as non-hazardous waste based on the results of soil samples analyzed for toxicity characteristics leaching procedure (TCLP) VOCs. Approximately 30 side-dump trailers transported 690.34 tons of contaminated soil to the landfill.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site was proposed for the National Priorities List (NPL) on March 18, 2022. A 60-Day Public Comment period ended on May 17, 2022. No comments were recevied. The site formally listed on the NPL on September 9, 2022.

An EPA contract was awarded in May 2023 for a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

City of LeMars, Iowa - Water Department Codes: Chapter 90 - Water Service System

90.23 Nonpublic Water Wells Prohibited: "No nonpublic well or water supply shall be installed where a public water supply system is reasonably accessible to the landowner. The determination of accessibility shall be made by the City Administrator. In the event the City Administrator determines the property is not accessible to a public water supply system, or if there is clear and convincing evidence that the accessible public water supply is inadequate to meet the needs of the landowner, then a variance from this prohibition may be obtained from the variance board if a well permit is obtained pursuant to state law or county ordinance."

### Sampling and Monitoring

The vapor mitigation systems are functioning as designed and remain protective of human health as of the last indoor air sampling event in 2021. Phase II of the Remedial Investigation is scheduled to begin the week of February 17, 2025. Additional soil and groundwater samples will be collected to further delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of contamination. The laboratory results from Phase II of the Remedial Investigation will inform the placement of permanent monitoring wells and whether additional soil/groundwater delineation is necessary.

### Green Remediation

The EPA transported approximately 107.84 tons of concrete and 3.02 tons of metal from demolition activities to Kellen Excavation, LLC for recycling. Additionally, several fluorescent light ballasts and one mercury-containing switch were transported to the Plymouth County household hazardous waste (HHW) facility for disposal/recycling.

### Emergency Response and Removal

The EPA Emergency Response and Removal consisted of Removal Assessments/supplements and Removal Actions/supplements. A Site Investigation was also conducted.

Removal Assessment/supplement activities included additional contaminant delineation, evaluation of potentially impacted media (soil, sub-slab vapor, indoor air, outdoor/ambient air and groundwater). Removal Action/supplement activities consisted of the installation of vapor mitigation systems (20 buildings) to protect indoor air and soil source area removal/disposal combined with in-situ treatment of residual contamination via sodium permanganate.

The Site Investigation was conducted to evaluate additional potential receptors and threats to human health and the enviroment. Private well surveys/sampling and vapor intrusion evaluations were conducted at locations with sensitive receptors (school, apartment complex, church, assisted living facility, residences, etc.) initially within one-half mile hydraulically downgradient from the dry cleaning building. All samples (with the exception of one) were either non-detect or below the Superfund Chemical Data Matrix or Maximum Contaminant Level for vapor or groundwater samples, respectively. One indoor air sample exceeded the Superfund Chemical Data Matrix Benchmark at the business located at 23 Central Ave. SW. This building has a functioning vapor mitigation system and the indoor air contamination has been attributed to processes involving ink within this specific business.

Site Investigation sampling results (sub-slab, indoor air, ambient air, private water wells) within the 0.5 mile hydraulically downgradient groundwater plume zone did not identify additional complete expsoure pathways.
