### Background

The International Smelting and Refining site is about two miles northeast of Tooele, Utah. It is on the west flank of the Oquirrh Mountains near the mouth of Pine Canyon.

The site consists of the Pine Canyon Conservation Area, the Pine Canyon/Lincoln Township Area and the Tooele Valley Railroad. From 1910 until 1972, copper, lead and zinc smelting and refining activities contaminated the smelter property and neighboring lands.

The EPA investigated the Site and found heavy metal contamination in soils, tailings and slag. The site was cleaned up. After the cleanup, the EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in October 2011.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being cleaned up by the EPA, state and Atlantic Richfield. Under Superfund law, Atlantic Richfield is called the potentially responsible party.

In 2005, Atlantic Richfield removed contaminated soil at the Tooele Valley Railroad. Up to 18 inches of contaminated soil were excavated from locations in town, near a school, in recreation areas and at two residential properties. Areas where soil was not removed were covered with clean soil or rock.

In 2006, Atlantic Richfield finished removing soil from the Pine Canyon Conservation Area. The work included placement of a 12-inch-thick soil cover over multiple areas of contaminated soil. Fencing and other physical barriers were built to keep people from going onto two locations. These places had physical hazards that prevented access and cleanup.

Atlantic Richfield also cleaned up other areas where surface soils were stained and plants were not growing in the conservation area. In this area, lead and arsenic concentrations were below the levels that needed to be cleaned up to protect human health. Atlantic Richfield removed the top 24 inches of soil, backfilled with clean soil and revegetated these areas.

Atlantic Richfield also changed and fixed some stormwater controls. Old foundations and vaults that were broken were backfilled, covered with clean soil and re-planted.

The EPA has done five-year reviews at the site. These reviews make sure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment. They also make sure the cleanup is working according to the plans.

The most recent review found that the cleanup still protects human health and the environment. There is a conservation easement and environmental covenant that prevents the use of groundwater. There is also a set of rules that requires more soil testing of undeveloped properties in the community to see if they need additional cleaning.

The EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List in July 2000. Atlantic Richfield did cleanup work. After the cleanup, the EPA took the site off the National Priorities List in October 2011.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Based on the January 2024 Updated Lead Guidance, the EPA is evaluating the risks from lead in soils to sensitive populations. This analysis will include compiling available site data to determine the potential presence and extent of lead-contaminated soils. Lead can pose health risks to sensitive populations, especially children under 7 years old and pregnant or nursing women. The process to implement the Updated Lead Guidance will involve additional planning, data gathering, risk assessment and funding requests. EPA will coordinate with our state partners and request public feedback on our proposed cleanup plans before additional cleanups begin.

While implementing the Updated Lead Guidance may take several years to complete, the EPA and Utah Department of Environmental Quality will share information on planned activities and results as they become available. In the meantime, and out of an abundance of caution, if you live near the International Smelting and Refining Superfund Site, the EPA recommends you have your children tested for lead annually; especially those under 7 and if the soil at your property was not replaced previously. Additionally, you can take some simple actions to limit exposure to potential lead contamination in soils, including:

- Maintaining yards and other soil cover;
- Washing hands, especially children’s, after handling soil, playing outside, and before meals;
- Making sure children eat nutritious meals high in iron and calcium;
- Keeping dust levels down by mopping and damp dusting regularly;
- Regularly changing out furnace filters;
- Keeping kids’ toys and play areas clean;
- Taking shoes off at the door and keeping pets clean;
- Wearing gloves while gardening; and
- Cleaning homegrown produce and peeling root vegetables.

The EPA International Smelting and Refining Superfund Site team will communicate with residents affected by this guidance about the specific next steps the Agency will take in their community. Residents may also contact the site’s Community Involvement Coordinator with questions or concerns at ( [haniewicz.missy@epa.gov)](mailto:haniewicz.missy@epa.gov?subject=nternational%20Smelting%20and%20Refining%20\(IS%26R\)%20site) or 720-415-4609.

The site’s long-term plan was chosen in 2007. This plan included:

- removing or capping contaminated soils
- adding fencing to keep people out of contaminated areas
- groundwater monitoring to study contamination
- creating a conservation easement, environmental covenants and a land use ordinance to keep people from contacting contaminated soil and groundwater

Atlantic Richfield finished required cleanup work before the EPA chose the final plan in the [2007 Record of Decision](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/08/1059503) [(pdf)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/08/1059503) (150pp, 15.08MB). The final plan addressed the remaining requirements: institutional controls, monitoring and maintenance.

The cleanup is finished. Today, there are operation and maintenance activities and groundwater monitoring on the site.

Site cleanup has also included short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 2004 and 2005, 76 properties were tested. 9,100 cubic yards of contaminated soils were removed from 17 properties in the Pine Canyon Area. The removed material was transported to the tailings dump in the reclaimed tailings pond area on the smelter property. After excavation, each property was backfilled and landscaped or restored.

The area surrounding and including the site was designated the Carr Fork Reclamation and Wildlife Management Area in 1994.

The former smelter area is owned by Atlantic Richfield. It is now called the Pine Canyon Conservation Area. The conservation area is managed by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources.

The site’s long-term remedy, selected in 2007, included removing or capping contaminated soils, adding fencing to restrict access, ongoing groundwater monitoring to assess contaminant levels, and implementing a conservation easement, environmental covenants and a land use ordinance to limit future human contact with contaminated media. Because all required response actions were completed by the potentially responsible party (PRP) prior to EPA’s final selection of a remedy, the 2007 Record of Decision addressed remaining requirements: institutional controls, monitoring and maintenance. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and groundwater monitoring are ongoing.

Site cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 2004 and 2005, 76 properties were sampled and 9,100 cubic yards of contaminated soils excavated from 17 properties in the Pine Canyon Area. The excavated material was transported to the tailings repository, located within the reclaimed tailings pond area on the smelter property. After excavation, each property was backfilled and landscaped or restored similar to the pre-construction condition.

The area surrounding and including the site was designated the "Carr Fork Reclamation and Wildlife Management Area" in 1994. The former smelter area is owned by the PRP, ARCO, and is now called the Pine Canyon Conservation Area. The conservation area is managed by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources.
