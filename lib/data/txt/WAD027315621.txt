### Background

The half-acre Northwest Transformer (South Harkness Street) site is located in Everson, Washington. The Northwest Transformer Service Company operated a transformer reclamation, storage and manufacturing facility on the site until its bankruptcy in 1987. Site activities and waste disposal practices contaminated soil with polychlorinated biphenyls ( [PCBs](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=PCB) ) and heavy metals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund programâ€™s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1997. No additional cleanup actions are required at the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was initially the location of a blacksmith shop. PCB-containing waste oil used as fuel for the shop heating furnace was stored in three 300-gallon tanks on the northern side of the west building. The west building housed an electric oven used to bake out residual oils from transformer components. The central building was used for painting transformers.

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Although not part of the selected remedy, the State of Washington required institutional controls in the form of deed notices to inform future property owners of residual petroleum and [PCB](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=PCB) contamination.

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1997.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions between 1993 and 1994 included demolition and disposal of on-site buildings; disposal of building contents; excavation and disposal of contaminated soil, placement of clean soil over excavated areas; and placement of an asphalt cap over all other excavated area. Following completion of these removal actions, EPA determined that no further action was required at the site.
