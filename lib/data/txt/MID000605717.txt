Background
The Berlin & Farro site is a fenced, 40-acre area south of the town of Swartz Creek in Genesee County, Michigan. Berlin and Farro Liquid Incineration, Inc. began operating at the site in April 1971. The facility accepted industrial waste for incineration, stored waste prior to incineration, and operated a 1.1-acre landfill on site for disposal of crushed, used drums. Permit violations and non-permitted activities led to revocation of the facility’s incinerator and landfill permits in 1975. Illegal dumping of industrial wastes on site continued after 1975. Berlin and Farro filed for bankruptcy in 1980. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1988.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site has been addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA selected the site’s long-term remedy in 1991 and updated it in 1995. The final remedy included excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil and sediment; excavation, dewatering and off-site disposal of material from contaminated portions of the aquifers; groundwater monitoring; and deed restrictions to prohibit the installation of groundwater wells for drinking or domestic purposes at the site until appropriate groundwater cleanup standards are met and maintained. A total of 124,244 tons of contaminated soil and sediment was taken off site for disposal. All available data indicates that the cleanup objectives of the groundwater monitoring program were met. Therefore, no additional groundwater monitoring is required at the site. Since the completed cleanup complies with the “clean closure” requirements, consistent with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, 40 CFR Section 264.11, no further activity or operation and maintenance is planned at the site. Because no hazardous substances remain at the site above health-based levels, future five-year reviews are not required at the site.After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1988.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Prior to cleanup, the goundwater and soil contained VOCs and PCBs.  Surface water, located in Slocum Drain and Swartz Creek was contaminated with pesticides.  PCBs and paint solvents were present in sludge.  Residents could have been exposed to site-related contaminants through direct contact with contaminated surface water in Slocum Drain and Swartz Creek.  In addition, onsite workers could have been exposed to contaminats if they drank or came into direct contact with contaminated groundwater. n/a

Emergency Response and Removal
Cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Berlin and Farro conducted limited cleanup activities at the site between 1978 and 1980. From 1981 to 1984, EPA, the State of Michigan and the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) removed the incinerator facility, five underground tanks and 4,000 drums, excavated the agricultural drain, and removed more than one million gallons of contaminated water, 15,300 cubic yards of contaminated lagoon sludge and 18,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil.
