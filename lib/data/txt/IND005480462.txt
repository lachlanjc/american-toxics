### Background

The 15-acre Cam-Or Inc. site is located near Westville in LaPorte County, Indiana. The Westville Oil Division of Cam-Or collected, stored and re-refined waste oil on site from 1934 until 1987. The waste oil was re-refined for use in automotive- and industrial-grade lubricating oil blends. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, cleanup planning is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and PRP actions. EPA is currently reviewing design plans for the remedy submitted by the site’s PRPs.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Planning and design work for the site’s long-term remedy is ongoing. EPA selected the site’s final remedy in June 2008. It included a soil containment system, a groundwater pump-and-treat system, a light non-aqueous phase liquid remediation system, monitoring systems and institutional controls. EPA is currently reviewing design plans for the remedy, submitted by the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs).

### Sampling and Monitoring

### Emergency Response and Removal

In 1987, EPA started a removal action, or short-term cleanup, to address immediate threats posed by conditions at the site. The action included consolidation and on-site stabilization of PCB-containing oils, treatment and discharge of 9.5 million gallons of wastewater, collection and containment of 1 million gallons of oil from on-site lagoons and the Forbes ditch, drum sampling, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, closure and backfilling of eight oil-filled lagoons, consolidation of PCB-contaminated lagoon wastes, and regrading to facilitate runoff and minimize ponding.
