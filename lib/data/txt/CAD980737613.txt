### Background

The 9-acre Jibboom Junkyard Superfund site is in Sacramento, California. The Associated Metals Company ran a metal-salvaging facility on site from 1950 to 1965. Salvage activities contaminated the area with various pesticides/herbicides and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). EPA added the site to the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983.

In 1965, after the facility closed down, the California Department of Transportation (DOT) purchased the 9-acre parcel and extended part of the Interstate 5 across a 7-acre area of the site. In 2005, Sacramento City Council approved the Jibboom Street Park Master Plan, which included redeveloping the remaining vacant 2-acre part of the site into a riverfront park along the Sacramento River Parkway bike trail. EPA worked closely with local officials to consider any potential site impacts from development plans and changing land uses. EPA reviewd the cleanup standards as well as groundwater and soil data from the site and surrounding areas. EPA determined that the site's remedy in that area was compatible with unrestricted use.

Jibboom Street Park opened on site in 2007, and the city renamed it Robert T. Matsui Waterfront Park in 2008.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Cleanup of the site included removal and disposal of contaminated soil and backfilling with clean soil.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The removal of contaminated soil from 2.3 acres and construction of an elevated freeway on the remainder of the property have eliminated the potential of exposure to hazardous materials at the site. All cleanup measures have proven effective. EPA took the site off the Superfund programâ€™s NPL in 1991.
