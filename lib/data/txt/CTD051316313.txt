### Background

The Precision Plating site is located in Vernon, Connecticut. The Precision Plating Corp. is one of several tenants in a small industrial complex known as the Hillside Industrial Park. The company has been chrome plating various metal parts and fixtures on this 3-acre area since 1970. Wastes generated during the chrome plating process contaminated drinking water wells in the Hillside Industrial Park.

The chrome plating process includes alkaline cleaning, chemical etching, rinsing, buffing and polishing. Wastes generated during this process include rinse waters containing heavy metals, batch wastes of alkaline cleaner, and spent plating and etching acids. These processes result in the generation of wastes and wastewater that may be caustic or acidic and thereby contain significant concentrations of chromium (total and hexavalent), metals (e.g., iron and lead) and other hazardous substances. Before 1983, rinse waters were discharged to a storm drain outside the company's facility. Process plating acids and chrome plating wastes were stored in drums and in a 500-gallon tank; however, past waste management practices were insufficient and discharges to two small "lagoons" also reportedly occurred.

In 1979, the Town of Vernon's Health Department found the well serving the Hillside Industrial Park was contaminated with hexavalent and trivalent chromium. In addition to historical discharges to the stormwater infrastructure and a nearby stream (Clarks Brook), as well as a drainage ditch and small "lagooon" located behind the facility, documented releases of chromium-containing wastes include: (1) exterior storage of drums containing liquid waste which spilled over during storm events, (2) the rupturing of drums and a storage tank by a snow plow, and (3) a localized release (approximately 35-gallons) of regenerate liquid from the ion exchnage resin beds associated with the former groundwater treatment system. Site investigation activities confirmed that groundwater underlying the Hillside Industrial Park, and beyond, had become contaminated. The site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in October 1989.

In January 1998, EPA entered into an agreement with the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection (DEEP; formerly the Department of Environmental Protection) in which the state agree to take the lead on site management. Following a decision by the property owner to discontinue further assessment of the nature and extent of contamination at the site, EPA and CT DEEP agreed in May 2011 that EPA Region 1 would assume responsibility as the lead agency for the site. EPA's remedial investigation activities were initiated in May 2012.

Site investigation activities have determined that Precision Plating was the site of a release of hexavalent chromium (Cr <sup>6+</sup> ) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS; primarily perfluorooctanesulfonic acid \[PFOS\]), in addition to acids and alkalis, and compounds typical of metal plating operations. PFAS are widely used, long lasting chemicals, components of which break down very slowly over time. One of the historic manufacturing sources of PFAS is metal plating and etching, where uses included corrosion prevention, mechanical wear reduction, aesthetic enhancement, surfactant, wetting agent/fume suppressant for chrome, copper, nickel and tin electroplating, and as a post-plating cleaner. Additional information related to PFAS can be found [here](https://www.epa.gov/pfas). Other potenial site-related contaminants of concerns include select volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other metals.

EPA's remedial investigation activities were undertaken in three primary phases between 2012 and 2019. A draft Remedial Investigation (RI) Report was completed in 2019. Supplemental remedial investigation activities were undertaken in 2021/2022 to address data gaps associated with site geochemistry, background conditions and the ecological risk assessment.

Due to complex site conditions (e.g., fractured bedrock geology) and the presence of emerging contaminants such as PFAS, the site was split into two distinct areas or Operable Units (OUs) in December 2022. OU-1 (Source Area) includes soil and overburden groundwater centered at the Hillside Industrial Park and OU-2 (Downgradient Groundwater Plume) includes bedrock groundwater. Breaking the Site into manageable pieces supports the selection of a cleanup remedy to improve OU-1 conditions while allowing for additional studies to address areas of uncertainty within OU-2

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions. The site is being addressed in two stages: initial actions and a long-term remedial phase focused on contamination across the entire site.

**Initial Action**: As series of state inspections and data collection during the mid- to late-1970s resulted in the state issuing several orders to compel installation of a wastewater treatment system, remove and dispose of toxic, hazardous and industrial waste stored at the facility, investigation of contamination, conduct remedial actions, and provide potable drinking water to the Hillside Industrial Park and High Manor community. Throughout the 1980s, a combination of engineering consultants and state agencies conducted a series of field investigations and sampling programs. Data collected during these early investigations, in combination with the state's enforcement orders, resulted in cleanup actions including:

- **1979** - Removal of approximately 20 cubic yards of soil from the waste storage area east of the Precision Plating facility.
- **1988** - Supplemental soil removal for the waste storage area, the former leach fields, and from the stormwater catch basin where historical discharges occurred.
- **1992** - Removal of approximately 2.5 to 3.5 cubic yards of soil associated with the regenerate liquid spill.
- **Early 1990s** - Hillside Industrial Park and High Manor community connected to public water supply.
- **1992 to 2008** - Source area groundwater extraction and treatment system operated at the Hillside Industrial Park.

**Remedial Phase (Entire Site)**: EPA completed a Preliminary Assessment in January 1985, a Site Inspection in August 1987 and a Hazard Ranking System package in June 1988. The site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in October 1989. The state took the lead on site management through May 2011, as which time EPA, with concurrence from the state, took on responsibility as the lead agency. EPA initiated a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) in May 2012. The RI/FS will determine the nature and extent of contamination and the risks posed to human health and the environment, and evaluate alternative cleanup measures if necessary. The draft RI Report was completed in 2019. Based on the results of investigation activities completed between 2012 and 2019, EPA completed supplemental investigations in 2021/2022 to address data gaps and refine the understanding of the nature and extent of contamination.

**Operable Units**: In September 2020 the Precision Plating Superfund Site was selected for review by EPA's National Remedy Review Board (NRRB). The NRRB consults and advises on some of the Superfund program’s most complex remedy decisions to ensure national consistency in remedy selection. Specifically, the NRRB advises and evaluates ongoing regional technical work during the scoping stage of the feasibility study for response decisions. More information on the NRRB can be found [here](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/national-remedy-review-board-nrrb).

In October 2022, the NRRB provided recommendations and advisory considerations to EPA Region 1. In consideration of the NRRB recommendations, the Site was subsequently divided into two Operable Units or OUs. During cleanup, a site can be divided into a number of distinct areas depending on the complexity of the problems associated with the site. These areas called Operable Units may address geographic areas of a site, specific site problems, or areas where a specific action is required. Operable Unit 1 (OU-1) in the source area soil and overburden groundwater proximate to the Precision Plating facility and Operable Unit 2 (OU-2) represents the downgradient bedrock groundwater. It is anticipated that OU-1 will progress towards the development of a Feasibility Study (FS) in 2025, while RI activities continue within OU-2 throughout 2025 and beyond.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA’s remedial investigation began in May 2012 and is currently ongoing. EPA's remedial investigation activities were initially undertaken in three primary phases between 2012 and 2019. Site fact sheets can be found here: [https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0100156&doc=Y&colid=40636&region=01&type=](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0100156&doc=Y&colid=40636&region=01&type=) SC

Supplemental remedial investigation activities were undertaken in 2021/2022 to address data gaps associated with site geochemistry, background conditions and the ecological risk assessment. A Remedial Investigation Addendum Report (RIRA) documenting the supplemental data collected at the site was drafted in 2024.

In June 2020, the Precision Plating Superfund Site was nominated, along with several other sites, for review by EPA's National Remedy Review Board (NRRB). Established in October 1995 to help control response costs and promote consistent, cost-effective remedy decisions, the NRRB reviews proposed cleanup decisions to help evaluate whether they are consistent with current law, regulations, and EPA guidance. In 2020, the NRRB was re-envisioned to promote engagement throughout the remedial process. As a result, the NRRB was engaged with the Precision Plating Superfund Stie as the Feasibility Study (FS) scoping stage of the remedial process. EPA Region 1 presented to the NRRB in May 2022, detailing items including the site's history, nature and extent of contamination, risk assessments, and screening of remedial technologies. The state and Town of Vernon also participated in the meeting. Final recommendations were issued by the NRRB in October 2022.

In consideration of the NRRB recommendations, the Site was subsequently divide into two Operable Units or OUs. Operable Unit 1 (OU-1) in the source area soil and overburden groundwater proximate to the Precision Plating facility and Operable Unit 2 (OU-2) represents the downgradient bedrock groundwater. It is anticipated that OU-1 will progress towards the development of a Feasibility Study (FS) in 2025. The FS serves to develop and evaluate a range of remedial action options for cleaning up the OU. EPA's preferred cleanup approach for OU-1 will be then be documented in a Proposed Plan.

RI activities are anticipated to continue within OU-2 throughout 2025 (and beyond) in parallel with remedy selection for OU-1. Extensive investigation activities including soil sampling, overburden and bedrock monitoring well installation, hydraulic conductivity testing, geophysical surveys, aquifer pumping tests, and groundwater sampling are planned.

### Sampling and Monitoring

EPA's support contractor routinely visits and conducts inspections of site to observe current conditions and document changes in the physical status, potential evidence of releases or insufficient waste management, and seasonal variations (e.g., stromwater migration and surface water drainage).

### Emergency Response and Removal

A Time Critical Removal Action (TCRA) was determined to be necessary to address unacceptable concentrations of hexavalent chromium in groundwater historically being utilized by homeowners and business proximate to the Hillside Industrial Park for potable water. An Action Memorandum for the TCRA was signed by EPA in 2015. The goal of the Removal Action was to provide water to residences and commercial properties with hexavalent chromium concentrations in excess of the 3.5 micrograms per liter (ug/L) Removal Management Level (RML) by offering to connect them to the Connecticut Water Company's existing water main within Hartford Turnpike. Five affected properties were connected to this water supply, including two properties north of the Hillside Industrial Park on Hartford Turnpike where construction of a water line extension was completed. Construction associated with the Removal Action was completed in 2018 and an After Action Report, documenting the response action, was finalized in January 2020.

### Enforcement Information

Historically, the state issued several orders to the property owner and/or Precision Plating Corporation to compel designand construction of a wastewater treatment system, evaluation of the nature and extent of contamination, removal and disposal of toxic, hazardous and industrial waste from the Hillside Industrial Park property, conduct remedial actions to minimize or eliminate contamination resulting from past practices at the Hillside Industrial Park, obtain discharge permits, and provide potable drinking water to the Hillside Industrial Park and High Manor community. Compliance with several of the orders was achieved and site investigation and response actions (e.g., soil removal, operation of a groundwater pump and treatment system) continued under state oversight through approximately 2008.

Following a decision by the property owner to discontinue further assessment of the nature and extent of contamination at the site, EPA and CT DEEP agreed in May 2011 that EPA Region 1 would assume responsibility as the lead agency for the site. EPA's remedial investigation activities were initiated in May 2012 and a search was undertaken to identify potentially responsible parties (PRPs) that may be liable at the Site.
