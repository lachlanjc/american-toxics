### Background

The 4.8-acre Alsco Anaconda site is located near the Tuscarawas River in Gnadenhutten, Ohio. From 1965 to 1978, Alsco used the site for the disposal of wastewater and wastewater treatment sludges from aluminum product manufacturing. Alsco discharged the wastewater to the river; sludge was disposed of into two unlined lagoons and a sludge pit. Overflow from the lagoons spilled into a low-lying wooded area near the river. Facility operations contaminated soil, sludge and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2001.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions under state and federal oversight.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Site cleanup consisted of two projects. Cleanup of source materials – contaminated sludge, soil and soil/waste mixtures – included the excavation and off-site treatment of the material. Groundwater cleanup included the installation and periodic sampling of groundwater monitoring wells. Construction of the remedy finished in 1995.

After follow-up investigations, EPA determined that the cleanup had eliminated the health threats posed by the site and that no further cleanup actions were necessary. EPA took the site off the NPL in 2001.
