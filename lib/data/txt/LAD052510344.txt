### Background

**Current Status**

The thirdFive-Year Review was completed in September 2017and included recommendations for site maintenance, ground water monitoring, and surface water monitoring. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is working with Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) to address these recommendations.

**Site Background**

The Delatte Metals site is located in Tangipahoa Parish, about 2.5 miles southeast of Ponchatoula, Louisiana. The site includes the former Delatte Metals, Inc. facility, the abandoned North Ponchatoula Battery (NPB) facility and nearby residential areas. The former facility properties occupy about 19 acres. The total area of the site, encompassing both on-facility and off-facility areas, is about 57 acres. While in operation, both facilities processed spent lead-acid batteries and smelted lead plates from the spent batteries into lead ingots. Site operators discharged battery acid into an unlined pond on the north side of the site. Facility operations and waste disposal practices contaminated soil, sediment, surface water and groundwater with lead.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state and federal actions.  
  
EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review included recommendations for site maintenance, groundwater monitoring and surface water monitoring. EPA is working with LDEQ to address these recommendations.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included excavation, solidification and disposal of contaminated soil; installation of a permeable reactive barrier (PRB) to raise the pH of groundwater; demolition, decontamination and disposal of on-site buildings and concrete slabs; construction of a fence around the site; institutional controls; and groundwater monitoring. Remedy construction took place between 2002 and 2003. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) maintains the site and monitors groundwater regularly.  
  
Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2005.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions in 1998 and 1999 included site controls to address contaminated residential properties, and stabilization, removal and off-site disposal of crushed battery casings, slag piles, settling basin solids and waste piles inside the battery saw building. Additional removal activities included disposal of 68 tons of contaminated smelter equipment, 28 drums of lead-contaminated oil and oil debris, 560 tons of scrap metal and over 6,600 gallons of sulfuric acid; excavation of contaminated sediment to facilitate installation of a public water supply line; and excavation of contaminated soil from residential properties.
