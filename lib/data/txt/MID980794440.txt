Background
The 11-acre Ossineke Ground Water Contamination site is located in Ossineke, Michigan. A study pinpointed three potential sources of groundwater contamination: the Barn (a gas and convenience store), the Marathon Service Station and an area southwest of the intersection of Alphonse and LaRose streets. Operations at these source areas contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals, which also threatened nearby wetlands. After EPA’s Underground Storage Tank (UST) program assumed responsibility for cleanup of the site, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1996.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

What Is the Current Site Status?
From 1979 to 1984, 14 wells with traces of contamination were replaced. EPA's investigation, completed in early 1991, determined that the source of contamination was from leaking underground storage tanks. Based on these findings, EPA's UST program assumed responsibility for cleanup. As of late 1995, the UST program had removed five underground storage tanks and piping from the site. EPA took the site off the NPL in 1996.In 2001, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) certified that the site complies with UST requirements in Michigan. In 2003, a Preliminary Close Out Report indicated that EPA and MDEQ had completed all construction activities at the site. MDEQ is now responsible for addressing the site as an Open Leaking Underground Storage Tank site. In 2006, a Long-Term Human Health Protection evaluation determined that long-term human health protection had been achieved at the site.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Groundwater under the site contains volatile organic compounds that are petroleum-related. Currently, no residents are obtaining drinking water from contaminated groundwater. However, people could be exposed to hazardous chemicals through accidental ingestion of or direct contact with groundwater. Wetlands, located eight miles from the site, may also be threatened.  no
