### Background

The 52-acre Pickettville Road Landfill Superfund site is located in Jacksonville, Duval County, Florida. Pickettville Road borders the site to the north and northwest, Little Six-Mile Creek borders the site to the east and southeast, and rural and residential properties border the site to the south and west. Site surroundings include industrial and residential land uses.

It includes the area where the City of Jacksonville operated a waste disposal facility from the 1940s to 1977. From the 1940s to the 1960s, a borrow pit for sand and a waste disposal facility operated at the site. Operations resulted in soil and groundwater contamination. In 1968, the City of Jacksonville began leasing the property for landfill operations, including the disposal of municipal and industrial wastes. In 1971, the landfill no longer accepted municipal waste and accepted hazardous wastes only. After inspections of the landfill, all waste disposal operations ended and the City of Jacksonville closed the landfill in 1977.

The site is not currently in use.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1983 because of contaminated groundwater and soil resulting from facility operations. EPA, the [Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP)](https://floridadep.gov/) and Pickettville Road Landfill Superfund Site Group, the site’s [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site to protect people and the environment from contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. A water line connects residences and businesses to the public water supply. By monitoring groundwater, placing institutional controls on the site property and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, FDEP and the site’s PRPs continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Pickettville Road Landfill Superfund Site Group, the site’s PRPs, led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by the EPA and FDEP.

**1983**  
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983 because of contaminated groundwater and soil resulting from facility operations.

**1990**  
In 1990, EPA issued the cleanup plan (a Record of Decision or ROD) for the site. It included:

- capping the landfill
- extending the public water system to nearby residents
- fencing the site
- restoring Little Six-Mile Creek
- long-term groundwater monitoring
- closing wells north of the site
- placing institutional controls restricting future uses of the site.

**1992**  
The site’s PRPs constructed a fence around the site and extended the public water supply to residences and businesses.

**1993**  
In 1993, the PRPs plugged and abandoned seven private water wells. By 2010, the project’s water line connected 10 property owners to the public water supply.

In 1993, the EPA placed institutional controls in the form of deed restrictions on the site property.

Between 1993 and 1997, the site’s PRPs conducted cleanup activities, including:

- construction of the landfill cover
- restoration of Little Six-Mile Creek
- implementation of a groundwater monitoring system
- long-term operation and maintenance activities.

**1996**  
In 1996, the EPA updated the remedy to allow for use of a geosynthetic clay liner instead of a clay barrier layer for the landfill cover.

**1997**  
The EPA and FDEP selected monitored natural attenuation to address groundwater contamination.

**2016**  
The site’s [fourth Five-Year Review](http://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11016000.pdf), completed in 2016, found that the cleanup remains protective of human health and the environment.

**2021**

The site's [fifth Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11160429.pdf), completed in 2021, found that the cleanup remains protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [fifth Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11160429.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2021. The Site's remedy currently protects human health and the environment because waste material has been excavated from Little Sixmile Creek and residual contamination is contained beneath a landfill cover system. Restrictions are in place to prevent groundwater use and future land uses that could damage the remedial components.

The site’s PRPs continue to conduct ground water monitoring twice annually.

The next Five-Year Review is due in 2026.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Restrictions are in place to prevent groundwater use and future land uses that could damage the remedial components.

In 1992, the site’s PRPs constructed a fence around the site and extended the public water supply to residences and businesses.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The site’s PRPs continue to conduct ground water monitoring twice annually.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRPs to investigate and clean up the site. The PRPs continue to fund site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
