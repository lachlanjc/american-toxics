Background
The Rose Park Sludge Pit site is located at Rosewood Park in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Utah Oil and Refining Company disposed of acidic waste sludge in an unlined pit on site from the 1930s until 1957. The sludge pit covered an area of about 5 acres and the waste material extended as deep as 20 feet below ground surface. A petroleum refinery east of the site served as the source of the waste material. These waste disposal activities contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2003. Site maintenance activities are ongoing.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site’s long-term remedy included construction of a slurry wall around the pit to isolate the wastes and prevent groundwater contamination; installation of a clay cap on top of the pit; installation of groundwater wells to monitor the ongoing effectiveness of the slurry wall; groundwater monitoring; and placement of traffic barriers around the perimeter of the cap to prevent cap damage. Remedy construction took place between 1982 and 1992. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing.
