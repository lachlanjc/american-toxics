Background
The Janeville  Disposal Facilities are located on a 65-acre parcel of land on Black Bridge  Road in Rock County, Wisconsin. The 18-acre Janesville  Old Landfill operated from 1963 to 1978. A residential neighborhood is located  about one-quarter mile to the east. The Old Landfill site is an abandoned sand  and gravel pit that was used as a municipal sanitary landfill which also  accepted drummed waste, including solvents, oil, paint, and paint thinners. The  landfill also accepted dried sludge from another Superfund site called the Janesville Ash Beds. There are no  private residential wells or municipal supply wells in the line of the ground water  plume between the landfill and the primary ground water discharge point, the  Rock River, which is 1,500 feet to the west. The cleanup,  which was completed in 1997, included a landfill cover, gas collection system,  and ground water treatment system.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
EPA’s groundwater cleanup at the Janesville Old Landfill (and Janesville Ash Beds), consisted of several actions including a landfill cap and gas collection and treatment systems which continue to prevent exposure to waste materials and minimize the flow of water through the waste mass. Natural processes appear to be controlling and reducing groundwater contaminant levels. All necessary controls are in place and are being enforced. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing. All immediate health threats have been addressed. There are no unsafe exposures to site-related contaminants. Several companies and the city of Janesville were responsible for the contamination. Today, EPA and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, oversee, review and approve their work. The city of Janesville serves as the agent for the group by monitoring and maintaining the site.

What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA is conducting a five-year review of the Janesville Old Landfill and Janesville Ash Beds.  The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This is the fifth review of the Janesville sites. More information is available at the Hedberg Public Library, 316 S. Main St., Janesville, and on this web page under Site Documents & Data.  The review should be completed by July 2021.                                                                                                                                               The five-year-review is an opportunity for you to tell EPA about site conditions and any concerns you have. Contact the community involvement coordinator or remedial project manager. Top of Page
