### Background

Henryetta Iron and Metal is a scrap-metal yard on the west side of Henryetta in southern Okmulgee County, Oklahoma. Henryetta Iron and Metal (HIM) operations consisted of acquiring an assortment of metal-containing objects from various sources for recycling. The property had been used as a metal salvage yard since the 1930s. Other businesses that have occupied the property include a blacksmith, motor freight lines, a welding facility, and a pipe and supply company. Electrical transformers containing PCBâ€™s were reportedly recycled on-site beginning in the 1950s. The facility is no longer active, but scrap piles remain on-site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The State of Oklahoma referred the site to the EPA because no other viable options for long-term remediation were available. The EPA received a letter of support for placing this site on the NPL from the state of Oklahoma.

In November 2018 EPA removed soil from three residential homes and city right of way. A berm was constructed to redirect surface water flow away from the residential homes already remediated.
