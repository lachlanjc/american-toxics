### Background

The 420-acre Velsicol Chemical Corp. (Marshall Plant) site is located near Marshall in east-central Illinois. The former Velsicol chemical plant produced products derived from petroleum byproducts and the pesticide chlordane. Plant operations contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and pesticides. Manufacturing operations at the Marshall plant stopped in 1988. Following cleanup, long-term groundwater treatment and monitoring is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In September 1983 the site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL). After negotiations with Velsicol failed to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS)at the site, Illinois EPA accepted lead responsibilities in 1985 with support from EPA. The RI field work took place from May 1986 through September 1987. The final report documenting the findings of the RI was issued in February 1988. The FS and the Proposed Cleanup Plan were issued in July 1988.

EPA issued a Record of Decision document detailing the cleanup plan in September 1998. Cleanup at the site consisted of removing contaminated sediment and soil, treating and capping of excavated materials, treating contaminated groundwater, and limiting the use of and access to the site.

In September 1989 EPA, Velsicol, and the State of Illinois entered in a legal agreement, known as a Consent Decree, for the remedial design and remedial action (RD/RA) at the site. Cleanup activities at the site were completed in May 1995.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is in the Operations & Maintenance phase of the Superfund process. EPA is conducting the sixth five-year review of the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents.

The five-year review is an opportunity for the public to tell EPA about site conditions and any concerns they may have. If you would like to share comments, please contact the Remedial Project Manager listed on this website.

The previous review completed in 2018 found that the remedy is currently protective of human health and the environment. Long-term protectiveness will continue to be maintained by operating the siteâ€™s groundwater collection and treatment system, and by limiting the use of and access to the site.
