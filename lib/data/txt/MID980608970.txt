Background
The 2-acre Cliff/Dow Dump site is located in Marquette, Michigan. The Royal Oak Charcoal Company disposed of hazardous substances, primarily volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), on site from 1954 to the mid-1960s. Hazardous tar deposits were the primary source of contamination at the site, which affected soil and groundwater. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2000.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site was addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site’s long-term remedy included excavation, treatment and disposal of contaminated fill material from the landfill, and monitored natural attenuation of the groundwater. Subsequent samples taken at the site show that remaining groundwater contamination does not pose an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. EPA took the site off the NPL in 2000. Deed restrictions on the use of the site and groundwater have been removed.
