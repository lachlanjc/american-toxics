Background
The former Westinghouse Electric Sharon Transformer Plant is a 58-acre facility located in Mercer County, Pennsylvania. During its operation from 1922 to 1985, Westinghouse manufactured electrical transformers at the site. Between 1936 and 1976, Westinghouse used blends of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and trichlorobenzene in the manufacturing of some of the transformers. Over the decades of operations at the plant, leakages and spills of the various materials resulted in contamination of the site soils, drainageways and sediments in the Shenango River, riparian soils in the floodplain of the Shenango River, and the groundwater. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in August 1990. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party actions. The site cleanup has been divided into portions or two operable units: Operable Unit 1 (OU1): The OU1 Record of Decision, issued on February 18, 2000, documents the remedy for contaminated soils. Approximately 35,400 tons of soil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were excavated and disposed off-site at permitted residual waste or hazardous waste landfills. Soil construction activities at the site were completed in 2004, and after a final inspection in September 2004, EPA determined that the soil cleanup was protective of human health and the environment. In May 2020, EPA issued an Explanation of Significant Differences for OU1. This document addresses the changes to the remedy previously selected in the OU1 Record of Decision. Soil contamination identified above the soil cleanup criteria in the Explanation of Significant Differences will be addressed. Operable Unit 2 (OU2): The OU2 Record of Decision, issued on February 20, 2003, documents the remedies for contaminated site groundwater, drainageways, riparian soils, and sediments of the Shenango River. EPA issued a technical impracticability waiver for drinking water standards at the site, meaning it is not possible to restore all or part of the groundwater plume. However, the Record of Decision mandated that long-term groundwater monitoring should continue to ensure the remedy remains protective of human health and the environment. PCB contaminated sediment and riparian soil were removed and disposed of off-site. The remedial action for OU2 began in 2004 and was completed in 2006. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
All site soils in the operable unit 1 (OU1) Record of Decision have been addressed. Soil contamination identified above the soil cleanup criteria in the 2020 Explanation of Significant Differences will be addressed. Sediments contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been removed from the site drainageways. The PCB-contaminated sediments and riparian soils in the Shenango River have been remediated, but recent sampling indicated that a section of sediment near the site has been re-contaminated from the release of PCBs into the storm sewer. Investigations and actions to stop the PCBs from getting into the storm sewer have been ongoing. Once this work is complete, the re-contaminated sediments from the Shenango River will be removed. The potentially responsible parties conducted fish tissue sampling in October 2015. The high levels of PCB in the results prompted the state to conduct further sampling in 2016. Findings from that sampling resulted in the state issuing a Do Not Eat Fish Advisory for all fish species from the Shenango River. In May 2020, EPA issued an Explanation of Significant Differences (PDF) for OU1 at the site. This document addresses the changes to the remedy previously selected in the Record of Decision. These changes do not fundamentally alter the remedy with respect to scope, performance, or cost.  EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the remedies at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place are protective of human health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent 2021 Five-Year Review (PDF) concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short-term. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2026.  Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Institutional controls are in placed to restrict groundwater use, fish consumption and future use of sites. Additional information about the institutional controls are available in the 2021 Five-Year Review (PDF) (pages 10-12).

Emergency Response and Removal
Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions completed in 2003 removed light non-aqueous phase liquid - a groundwater contaminant that is less dense than water - from groundwater in the Middle Sector Building portion of the site.
