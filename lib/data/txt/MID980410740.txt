### Background

The 120-acre Forest Waste Products site is located in Forest Township, Michigan. Waste disposal areas on site include an 11-acre landfill and nine former lagoons that span a total area of 1 acre. The landfill accepted waste materials from 1973 to 1978. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. The former lagoons were cleaned up in 1989 and the landfill capped in 1997. Groundwater monitoring has been taking place both on- and off-site since 1993.

Area residences use private wells for drinking water. Groundwater sampling originally showed groundwater contamination at the original site area and east of the former landfill. However, later sampling has shown the contamination extends off-site to the north and west, requiring further investigation and action.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review in 2017 identified the need for the investigation of the nature and extent of the 1,4-dioxane contamination so that a new treatment technology could be selected. This is being addressed by the current on-going investigation to characterize the presence of 1,4-dioxane at the site. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires attainment of groundwater action levels.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included fencing, the removal, treatment and off-site disposal of contaminated drums, sludges and contaminated soils, and landfill capping. Construction of these parts of the remedy took place before 1997. The long-term remedy also requires institutional controls as well as ongoing groundwater sampling and treatment. A groundwater investigation is currently underway to better define the extent of the 1,4-dioxane contamination and to help choose a new cleanup approach for this compound.

The PRPs initiated a phased 1,4-dioxane investigation at the site from April 2012 to February 2016. The PRPs submitted a Pre-Design Work Plan in November 2016, which outlined the conceptual and remedial strategy for the 1,4-dioxane contamination at the site. Following discussions and revisions, EPA and MDEQ approved the plan in late 2017. The PRPs began field investigation the week of January 15, 2018. However, in February 2018, due to weather conditions and concerns about data quality, the parties jointly decided to stop all drilling activities at the site until the spring.

Sampling and Monitoring

In 2011, EPA requested that 1,4-dioxane be added to the annual groundwater sampling list. Results show the groundwater contains low levels of 1,4-dioxane, but the pollution is moving off-site. Since all residents in the area use residential wells for drinking water, EPA required sampling of the private wells to see if they contained any contaminants from the site. In early 2015, 15 residential wells were sampled for the presence of volatile organic compounds and 1,4-dioxane. Six of the sampled wells, which were at a depth of 30-50 feet, showed low levels of 1,4-dioxane. Although concentrations found were below the state drinking water cleanup standards for 1,4-dioxane, the PRPs voluntarily offered replacement wells to the six property owners. These wells are drilled into a much deeper, bedrock aquifer containing no site pollution. That effort has been completed at five properties where residents agreed to a replacement well.
