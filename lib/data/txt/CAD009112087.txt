Background
The Koppers Company, Inc. Superfund site (Site) is a former wood-treating facility that covers an area of approximately 205 acres, located less than three miles south of the town of Oroville. Chemical fires, wood treatment operations, product and chemical handling methods, and wastewater handling procedures contaminated soil on-property, and groundwater both on and off-property.
Beginning in 1920, Hutchison Lumber mill operated at the location which later became the Koppers Company, Inc. Superfund Site. In 1948, National Wood Treating Company purchased the property and initiated wood treatment operations with ammoniacal copper arsenate, pentachlorophenol-in-oil mixture and creosote. In 1955, Koppers Company, Inc. purchased the property and expanded its wood treatment operations using chemical preservatives such as: pentachlorophenol (PCP), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), creosote, chromated copper arsenate solution, and boron. The operations of the wood treating facility included injections of preservatives under pressure into wood products such as railroad ties and telephone poles to prevent deterioration by insects and fungi.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
EPA selected soil and groundwater remedies at the Site in its September 13, 1989, Record of Decision (ROD). The remedies addressed on-property soil contamination, and one combined groundwater unit for on and off-property groundwater contamination.  The groundwater component of the remedy included extraction and treatment of the contaminated groundwater and providing an alternative water supply to residents with contaminated drinking water wells. The soil component of the remedy consisted of various in-situ treatment technologies. In 1991, EPA modified the soil component remedy in an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) which clarified that the soil remedial objectives applied only to soils from the ground surface to five feet below ground surface (bgs), and that EPA would establish future cleanup standards for soils deeper than five feet bgs to protect groundwater. EPA also required institutional controls, land use restrictions prohibiting among other things, residential use of the plant property, until EPA determined that the Site was clean enough to remove those restrictions. In 1996, EPA issued ROD Amendment No. 1 changing the soil and groundwater cleanup standards based on continued industrial use, while prohibiting future residential use through institution controls (e.g., deed restrictions). Along with the reversal from future residential land use, a new soil remedy was selected.  Instead of various in-situ treatment/stabilizations selected for each soil unit, all contaminated soils, from the four soil units as well as soil from other contaminated areas, not accessible at that time, were to be disposed into an engineered on-site landfill. EPA determined that development of cleanup standards for subsurface soils deeper than five feet bgs was not needed; this determination in the 1996 ROD Amendment supersedes the requirement of the 1991 ESD. The 1996 ROD Amendment also included long-term management and maintenance of the landfill cover and groundwater monitoring around the landfill. In 1999, EPA issued ROD Amendment No. 2 modifying the groundwater remedy to include a Technical Impracticability (TI) Waiver for a 4-acre area of the plume. EPA determined a need for the TI Waiver because it is technically impracticable from an engineering perspective to achieve the groundwater cleanup standards in the TI Zone due to the presence of dense non-aqueous phase liquid contamination. The 1999 ROD Amendment No. 2 also augmented the pump-and-treat remedy for the Eastern On-Property groundwater plume, by adding enhanced in-situ bioremediation (i.e., injecting nutrients) into select on-property wells. EPA additionally selected a contingency remedy of monitored natural attenuation.  Finally, EPA selected the implementation of institutional controls through deed restrictions to prevent access to groundwater, surface disturbances and the addition of new sources of surface water to groundwater in the TI Zone. The final remedial action objectives, although not explicitly stated as such in the ROD, ROD amendments or ESD, are as follows: 1) groundwater containment in the TI Zone, 2) restoration of groundwater to beneficial uses outside the TI Zone, and 3) prevention of exposure to contaminated soil and groundwater. Finally, the remedy requires maintenance and monitoring of the landfill to assure that the landfill does not release any contaminants to groundwater.
By 2003 all components of the selected remedies, discussed above had been implemented.

What Is the Current Site Status?
Contamination at the Site is currently limited to on-property sources including the groundwater plume and soil disposed in the landfill. The landfill cells are lined and capped, all components appear to be in good condition and there is no indication of any contaminant containment issues with any of the cells. Groundwater analytical data collected from six pairs of monitoring wells, installed around the perimeter of the cells and sampled annually for contaminated groundwater, have reported no detections above ROD cleanup standards. The on-property groundwater remediation system prevents migration of the plume and is making progress toward cleanup standards and returning groundwater to beneficial use as a drinking water supply. The treatment system consists of three extraction wells, a treatment system, two injection well sand in-situ bio enhancement added quarterly at monitoring wells. Extraction wells are located downgradient of the source area and each pump approximately 150 gallons per minute. This groundwater system is operated by a contractor to the Potentially Responsible Party. The system will continue to operate until the cleanup standards are met.
Off-property groundwater achieved the remediation objective of restoring groundwater to its beneficial use, as a drinking water supply, and the off-property groundwater monitoring ceased in June 2013.
