### Background

The Hercules Site is a former 200-acre chemical manufacturer that operated from 1923 to 2009. During operations, over 250 chemical products, including paper and textile chemicals, paints, varnishes, pesticides and insecticides (including toxaphene) were produced. After the plant closed in 2009, most of the structures were demolished. Structures that remain include a building used as an office, a former cafeteria, concrete basins and a backfilled surface impoundment from the former wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), sludge disposal pits, a closed landfill, and railroad tracks – some of which are active. Pesticide manufacturing mainly occurred in the central portion of the Site. Sludge generated from the WWTP was disposed in the sludge disposal pits. A network of monitoring wells is present at the Site for semi-annual groundwater monitoring. On-Site soil and underlying groundwater are contaminated with hazardous substances that were used or produced by the facility.

On March 18, 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed the Hercules site in Hattiesburg, Mississippi to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) through a Federal Register Notice. The Superfund program, a federal program established by Congress in 1980, investigates and cleans up the most complex, uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites in the country and converts them into productive local resources by eliminating or reducing health risks and environmental contamination associated with hazardous waste sites. Federal Register notices and supporting documents for the final and proposed sites can be found online. The site was added to the NPL on December 20, 2022. Prior to the listing, the EPA held a 90-day public comment period.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Hercules conducted closure activities at the former industrial landfill, former impoundment basin, and the ET-10 tank (formerly associated with the WWTP). In addition, Hercules purchased two residential properties east of the site’s property boundary where VOCs were detected in soil gas and crawlspace air. Since 2007, Hercules has conducted routine semi-annual groundwater and surface water monitoring.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

On March 18, 2022, the Hercules Site was proposed to the National Priorities Listing (NPL) through a Federal Register Notice. Proposing the site to the NPL allows EPA, the state, and the community to access significant technical and financial resources to address environmental and health risks. Throughout the Superfund (CERCLA) site cleanup process, the EPA considers beneficial site reuse opportunities. More than 850 Superfund sites nationwide have some types of actual or planned reuse underway. Community partnerships are critical to Superfund site cleanups. EPA's goal is to work with community partners to ensure a collaborative and transparent cleanup process.

As a result of community concerns, the EPA is working with Hercules to ensure positive measures are taken to improve the appearance of the Hercules site and its surrounding area. This work is in response to issues and concerns that were raised at the community meeting held in May 2022. Hercules has mowed areas inside of the fence perimeter along West 7th Street, Providence Street, and Highway 42, removed overgrowth of vines and shrubs along areas of fence line and the parcel with the pole barn. They have repaired fencing, cleaned the main entrance gate at West 7th Street, and removed the abandoned brick wall on West 7th Street. Hercules has committed to working with the City of Hattiesburg to ensure the right-of-way outside the fence line is also mowed. Additionally, Hercules conducted a site walkdown with a local contractor to address further brush and vegetation removal needs. A scope of work and timeline are being developed for tank and pipe removal near Providence Street.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Sampling has been conducted over the years to evaluate contamination on the property that included groundwater, surface water, sediment and soil gas that resulted from past chemical manufacturing activities at the Site. These investigations have shown site-related contamination in former operational and disposal areas throughout the property and that groundwater contamination has migrated off-site. The extent of contamination has not been delineated. Since 2007, Hercules has conducted routine semi-annual groundwater and surface water monitoring. Additional sampling will occur in the form of a Remedial Investigation (RI).

### Enforcement Information

The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) referred Hercules to the EPA to investigate potential violations of requirements outlined in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). RCRA is the law that creates the framework for proper management of hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste. Since 2007, Hercules has performed site investigations, interim remedies, and semi-annual groundwater and surface water quality monitoring to comply with MDEQ and EPA orders. However, site-wide contamination remains and is a continual source of groundwater contamination. Beginning in 2011, the EPA required additional investigations and monitoring events to further assess contamination on site, in underlying groundwater, and in nearby drainage routes. In 2019, the EPA referred the Hercules site from its RCRA Program to its Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) program, also known as Superfund.
