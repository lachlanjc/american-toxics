### Background

The former Fort Devens Sudbury Training Annex site is located in the towns of Hudson, Stowe, Maynard, and Sudbury in eastern Massachusetts. The area was an active facility until it closed under the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1995. Wastes generated by the facility while it was operating contaminated soil and groundwater. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2002. Ownership of most of the site property transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as the Assabet River National Wildlife Refuge in 2005.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal actions. All sites have been cleaned up or closed out. EPA took the site off the NPL in June 2002. In addition, while many of the contaminants detected across the site were within acceptable risk standards for recreational use, risks associated with future, residential use scenarios were identified and were the focus of EPA’s cleanup decisions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the landfill are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the landfill remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment

The emerging contaminant PFAS was detected at the former AOC A9 and P13. From 2017 to 2021, the Army investigated the impact of PFAS in groundwater at A9 at which a drinking water well was installed by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. The investigation report is expected to be submitted to the regulatory agencies for review in late 2022.

The next five-year review report will be completed in September 2026.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Cleanup of the 2,750-acre site was done under a 1991 Federal Facilities Agreement between the U.S. Army and EPA. Hazardous materials were removed or capped. The cleanup was completed on Jan. 29, 2002. The Army has transferred 71.525 acres to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for a regional operations center and several training areas; 2205 acres to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for a refuge and 4.148 acres to the U.S. Air Force for a radar/weather monitoring station. The Army still manages yearly monitoring and maintenance of the Old Gravel Landfill (Area of Contamination (AOC) A7). The landfill cover and fence are intact and is protecting the public from direct contact threats and the landfill from trespassers. There are no drinking water wells at the landfill, however, a drinking water well was installed in the former AOC A9 near the north gate of the facility. The Army conducted preliminary site investigations at AOC A9 and AOC P13 from 2017 to 2021 to determine the presence of PFAS contamination and determined that the well is not safe to use because PFAS was detected in groundwater above the 20 parts per trillion Massachusetts Maximum Contaminant Level (MMCL) for six PFAS contaminants. As of March 2025, the Army is currently conducting a remedial investigation at both AOC A9 and P13 to determine the extent of PFAS contamination in soil, groundwater, surface and sediment. The next five-year review report will be finalized by September 2026.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**  
  
This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.  
  
The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
