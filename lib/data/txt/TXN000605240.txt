### Background

The Lane Plating Works, Inc. site is a former electroplating facility located at 5322 Bonnie View Road, approximately five miles south of downtown Dallas, Dallas County, Texas. The site is a former electroplating facility that primarily conducted hard chromium and cadmium plating for more than 90 years. Electroplating was performed manually. Due to violations, investigations and bankruptcy filing, the facility shut down. Investigations by the EPA and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) found on-site soils and shallow ground water contaminated with plating wastes.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

►Lane Plating is a former electroplating facility that conducted electroplating for approximately 90 years up until 2015. Operations ceased in 2015 with numerous violations, investigations, and bankruptcy.

►2016 Site Referred to EPA by TCEQ

►2016 Initial Sampling by EPA Removal Branch

►2016 EPA Conducted an Initial Cleanup. Over 188,000 lbs of Waste Material was Removed

►2018 EPA Added the Site to the National Priorities List January 2019

►Jan 2019 - Dec 2020 Remedial Investigation (RI) for Long-Term Cleanup

►Aug 2021 – Feb 2024 Feasibility Study (FS)

►Jun 2022 –Sep 2022 Removal Assessment

►November 2022- August 2023 Removal Action

►November 2023 – current Treatability study.

►February 2025 - Announcement of Proposed Plan and Comment Period

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Work at the site is being done by two EPA programs. The removal program is focused on quick responses to immediate threats from hazardous substances or to eliminate dangers to the public. The remedial program is focused on studying the nature and extent of contamination at the site and planning a longer-term cleanup to address remaining contamination.From 2019 to 2021, the EPA remedial program conducted a RI in two phases at the site. During the RI, the following activities were performed:

• Collection of soil, sediment surface water, and groundwater samples to determine the nature and extent of contamination.

• Installation of soil borings and permanent groundwater monitoring wells.

• Determining the total depth of existing hand-dug water wells.

•Collection of background samples for soil, sediment, and surface water.

Samples were collected and analyzed for volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, PFAS, total petroleum hydrocarbons, oxidation reduction potential, total organic carbon, metals, and pH. Analytical results from both RI Phase 1 and Phase 2 events can be found in the RI Report, Revision 03 (EA 2020a). In August of 2021 the EPA remedial program started work on a FS to evaluate remedial alternatives and to support remedy selection. Results from the FS can be found in the Feasibility Study Report, Revision 02 (EA 2024)

From June to September 2022, the EPA Removal Branch conducted a Removal Site Evaluation to determine the need for a Time-Critical Removal Action. This sampling event consisted of the collection of surface soil, air, wipe, paint, and bulk items (drywall, texture, and joint compounds). It also consisted of surveying the electroplating building and all its outside structures. The Removal Site Evaluation led to the enaction of a Time-Critical emoval Action in November 2022. The Time-Critical Removal Action involved the excavation and disposal of soils from the process area of the site that exceeded site specific clean up levels. The soil excavation occurred elow the building footprints and up to five feet below the ground surface or until groundwater was encountered. The excavated soils were disposed of at an approved landfill followed by replacement of excavated soil with clean fill dirt and restoration of the soils to pre-removal conditions. In addition, the removal included the demolition of the Main Plating Building (MPB) and the Hazardous Waste Treatment Building. This action was done to address the imminent and substantial endangerment to human health and the environment posed by the contamination on the site and its migration to offsite areas surrounding the site.

All of the soil in the proscess area has been excavated and replaced with clean fill dirt. The area has been seeded with native grass. Soil in some parts of the open area still exceed clean up goals and will be addressed by the remedial program. Shallow groundwater will also need to be addressed by the remedial program.
