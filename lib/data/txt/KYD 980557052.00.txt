### Background

The 112-acre Lee's Lane Landfill Superfund site is in southwest Louisville, Kentucky. Much of the site was used for a quarry in the 1940's and 1950's, and later operated as a landfill through 1975.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983 because of contaminated groundwater, surface water, sediment, soil and air resulting from landfill operations. EPA and the Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection (KDEP) have investigated and completed remedial action at the site. EPA removed the site from the NPL in 1996.

The remedy at the site currently protects human health and the environment because there are currently no completed exposure pathways. By conducting regular site inspections, maintaining the landfill cap, and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA and KDEP continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

A water line connects nearby residences and businesses to the public water supply.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The EPA led site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with KDEP. Since 1992, the Louisville/Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD), one of the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs), led operations and maintenance (O&M) activities at the site. In October 2020, MSD completed the 29 years of O&M required by the 1991 Administrative Order on Consent with EPA. According to a 1992 Memorandum of Understanding with EPA, KDEP has taken over O&M activities at the site.

**1980 - 1981**  
The Kentucky Department of Hazardous Materials and Waste Management installed a gas venting system on site. In 1981, the owners of the site pumped liquid wastes from the exposed drums found near the Ohio River and transported hazardous wastes off site for disposal. The site owners also removed drums and other wastes from the riverbank and buried them on site.

**1986**  
EPA issued the site’s long-term cleanup plan in 1986. It included:

- operating and maintaining the gas venting system
- cleaning up surface waste areas
- installing riverbank erosion protection controls
- sampling groundwater
- removing exposed drums from the site and disposing of them at an off-site landfill
- placing a cap over contaminated soil and exposed wastes
- placing cautionary signs at the site and installing a gate to control access to the site.

**1987 – 1988**  
EPA conducted cleanup activities at the site in 1987 and 1988.

**1996**  
EPA removed the site from the NPL in 1996. Groundwater and air monitoring continued.

**2013 - 2015**

- EPA completed the site’s fifth FYR in 2013. To address the questions raised by the 2013 FYR, KDEP conducted surface and subsurface soil sampling at 28 locations on site in April 2013.
- EPA conducted soil gas sampling along the site perimeter in June 2013 that identified six contaminants that were migrating off site. In response, EPA conducted vapor intrusion sampling in June 2014 in 33 homes in the adjacent Riverside Gardens community to determine whether gases from the landfill were migrating into the homes. EPA completed the vapor intrusion study and determined no homes were being impacted by gases from the landfill. In addition, methane is no longer a threat. KDEP installed five new groundwater monitoring wells at the site in May 2014 and monitored semi-annually for 3 years. Results remained stable. The sampling results are available from KDEP.
- EPA met with the settling PRPs in March 2014 to discuss the results of the 2013 FYR and the need for additional data. The PRPs prepared a comprehensive Conceptual Site Model (CSM) that summarizes all of the data gathered from 2013 to 2015 to determine what FYR concerns have been addressed, and where further work was needed.

**2018-2020**  
KDEP conducted further soil gas monitoring which showed methane only in a single location which could be addressed through venting of that location.

**2022**  
KDEP assumed responsibility for site operations and maintenance (O&M).

**2023**

KDEP removed the gas collection system after confirming it was no longer needed.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

KDEP is now responsible for operations and maintenance at the site. Because sampling has indicated that the gas venting system is no longer needed, KDEP removed the venting equipment in spring 2023. In early 2025, KDEP will be installing larger and more easily seen signs to identify the site boundaries.

EPA completed the [Seventh Five-Year Review (FYR)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11189529.pdf) on August 30, 2023. The conclusion of the review was that the remedy remained protective of human health and the environment because there were no completed exposure pathways. In order to be protective in the long-term, EPA issued an Explanation of Significant Differences in August 2022 to add institutional controls to the remedy. The institutional controls include restrictions that will be placed on the property deeds to prevent certain site uses and groundwater well installation.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The parcels that make up the site are privately owned. Accessing the site without authorization from the owner is trespassing. The site boundaries are marked with signs and a gate controls vehicle access. KDEP has acquired new larger and more easily seen signs to identify the site boundaries. and has plans to install them in early 2025.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

In 1991, the EPA negotiated a legal agreement with the Louisville and Jefferson County MSD, one of the site’s PRPs, to perform O&M activities at the site for 29 years, with oversight provided by KDEP. In 1992 and 1993, the EPA reached settlements with more than 20 site PRPs. The EPA used the settlement funding for site investigation and cleanup activities.
