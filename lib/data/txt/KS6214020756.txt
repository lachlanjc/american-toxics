### Background

Fort Riley is an active U.S. Army installation in north-central Kansas, north-northeast of Junction City and west of Manhattan. The installation encompasses 101,733 acres and is under the jurisdiction of Installation Management Command. Fort Rileyâ€™s primary mission is to train forces to meet joint force requirements across the full spectrum of current and future operations. Historical operations by the Army at Fort Riley have resulted in the release of hazardous substances to soil, surface water and groundwater. The primary site Contaminants of Concern include chlorinated volatile organic compounds, metals and munitions and explosives of concern. Fort Riley was added to the National Priority List on October 1, 1990. An Interagency Agreement, also known as a Federal Facility Agreement, between the Army, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment was finalized on June 28, 1991.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

To date, Remedial Activities at Fort Riley have been divided into nine Operable Units (OUs). A brief description of activities conducted at each OU follows.

OU1 (Southwest Funston Landfill): This OU encompasses 120 acres in the southern portion of the site that operated as a landfill from the mid-1950s to 1981, receiving municipal and industrial wastes. The landfill was closed in 1983, and a continuous soil cover was constructed. The Record of Decision (ROD), signed on August 6, 1996, selected a remedy including institutional controls, landfill cover maintenance, riverbank stabilization and groundwater monitoring. A Remedial Action Completion Report was approved in February 2010. Ongoing activities include annual cap inspections, maintaining the landfill cover, continued river bank stabilization as needed and periodic groundwater monitoring.

OU2 (Pesticide Storage Facilities Area): This OU encompasses 2/3 of an acre surrounding building 348 in the Main Post Area. A Non Time-Critical Removal Action including excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soils was completed in 1994. No further action is required at this OU.

OU3 (Dry Cleaning Facility): This OU encompasses five areas in the southwest corner of the main post cantonment area. Areas of chlorinated solvent contamination were addressed via multiple pilot studies. A ROD was signed on March 18, 2008. The selected remedy was monitored natural attenuation with institutional controls. Current activities include continued annual groundwater monitoring.

OU4 (Former Fire Training Area at Marshal Army Air Field): This OU encompasses the Former Fire Training Area at Marshall Army Airfield. The FFTA was operational from the mid-1960s to 1984 and was used to conduct fire training exercises. Fuels (jet fuel, diesel, leaded gasoline and tetrachloroethene) were poured into the FFTA, ignited and then extinguished. Soil contamination was reduced through a 1995 pilot study. A ROD was signed on August 10, 2005. The selected remedy included monitored natural attenuation and institutional controls. A Remedial Action Completion Report was approved in 2010. Remediation goals have been achieved for this OU. There are no current activities.

OU5 (Building 354 Solvent Detection Area): This OU encompasses a volatile organic compound groundwater plume at the Main Post cantonment area north of the Kansas River. The ROD, signed on June 16, 2006, selected the remedy of monitored natural attenuation and institutional controls. The groundwater plume at OU5 is mostly contained to the terrace aquifer but a small portion of the plume has migrated to the Kansas Alluvial aquifer. Currently, the Army is planning to install four additional monitoring wells to enhance the monitoring network. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing.

OU6 (Open Burn/Open Detonation): This OU encompasses an area historically used for open detonation and open burning of ordnance within Range 16, approximately 2,300 feet north of Vinton School Road. The main contaminant for this OU is trichloroethene. The ROD, signed in September 20, 2016, selected the remedy of soil removal with disposal or treatment, groundwater/surface water monitoring and institutional controls. A Remedial Action Completion Report for soil was approved in June 2023, and a Remedial Action Completion Report for groundwater was approved in January 2025. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing.

OU7 (WWI Incinerator NW Camp Funston): This OU encompasses an area within the Camp Funston cantonment area where an incinerator operated during World War I. The incinerator was used to burn garbage from Camp Funston with wood being used as the fuel. Following completion of the Feasibility Study, a re-evaluation of site risk was conducted. This resulted in the conclusion that there is no unacceptable human health risk at OU7. On March 29, 2019, a ROD was signed that selected the remedial alternative of no action. No additional work is planned at this OU.

OU8 (Sherman Heights Small Arms Range): This OU encompasses the Sherman Heights Small Arms Range, between the Colyer Manor military housing complex and the Sherman Heights highlands. The area was used for a variety of munitions-related training activities (including anti-aircraft and anti-tank ranges) dating back to the 1880s, in addition to small arms training. Lead is the contaminant of concern for this OU. A ROD was signed in 2016 that selected the remedial alternative of land use controls with long-term management. The Army has completed the installation of fencing and signs along the perimeter of the OU. Periodic monitoring of soil and groundwater is ongoing. In addition, the Army conducts annual inspections of the land use controls.

OU9 (Camp Forsyth Landfill Area 2): This OU encompasses the Camp Forsyth Landfill Area 2 Munitions Response Site. Historical operations include the Camp Forsyth Landfill, maneuver and training areas (including a mock Vietnam Village), public parks, and dredging operations. During significant flooding in 1993, approximately 200 rockets, mines and a variety of small arms ammunition were discovered in a sandbar within the Republican River. Subsequent investigations identified several areas of munitions and explosives of concern at the OU. A Proposed Plan was completed in October 2019, listing the Army's preferred remedial alternative of surface and subsurface removal of military munitions in the Republican River and Breakneck Creek. A public meeting was held on October 23, 2019, to provide the public an opportunity to provide feedback and ask questions. The Final ROD was signed on June 22, 2020, and is available in the Army's administrative record file. Remedial Action is ongoing.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Current activities include implementation of the remedy at OU9 and long-term monitoring required for the remedies at OU1, OU3, OU5, OU6 and OU8. Since 2020, the Army has been investigating potential releases of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at the site. Initial sampling results reported PFAS compounds above screening levels in groundwater. Since those findings, additional rounds of sampling have been completed to determine the extent of contamination at identified areas of interest. The investigation of PFAS in soil and groundwater at the site is ongoing.

The recent Fifth Five-Year Review was completed on September 27, 2022. The purpose of the Five-Year Review is to evaluate the implementation and performance of site remedies in order to determine if they are or will be protective of human health and the environment. Five-Year Reviews are required for any remedy that results in any hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant remaining at the site above levels that allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The Army is conducting long-term monitoring required for the remedies at OU1, OU3, OU5, OU6 and OU8. The investigation of PFAS in soil and groundwater at the site is ongoing.
