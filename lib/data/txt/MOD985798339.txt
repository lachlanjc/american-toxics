### Background

The Newton County Wells Site originates at the FAG Bearings facility, which is located at 3900 South Rangeline Road in Joplin, Newton County, Missouri. The site extends southward through the Villages of Silver Creek and Saginaw, to the Thurman and Shoal Creek bottoms. The site includes the FAG Bearings property and all contaminated groundwater. The total area impacted by the site encompasses approximately 2.5 square miles.

FAG Bearings has operated a ball bearing manufacturing plant at the site since approximately 1971. As part of the manufacturing of balls for the bearings, a trichloroethylene (TCE), vapor degreasing system was utilized to remove impurities, operating from approximately 1972 to 1982. In 1983, FAG Bearings repurposed portions of the the former TCE degreaser system and during the refitting of some piping, a clear liquid was observed spilling into a utility trench. It is suspected the fluid was residual TCE from the former TCE degreaser system.

The site was initially discovered in April 1991 by the Missouri Department of Health, now called the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, as part of another site investigation which involved private well sampling in the area. At that time the residents in the Villages of Silver Creek and Saginaw used private domestic wells for drinking water. TCE and cis-1,2-dichloroethene were detected in some of these wells at concentrations, which exceeded the Maximum Contaminant Level established by the EPA.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In the fall of 1991, well sampling indicated that homes located directly south of the FAG Bearings property contained the high concentrations of TCE. In response, bottled water was made available to residents with contaminated wells until an EPA initiated Time-Critical Removal Action was completed, connecting residents to the public water supply. In July 1994, public water supply connections were completed and included residents in the Villages of Silver Creek and Saginaw.

In December 1998, FAG Bearings conducted a Removal Investigation of its property with Department oversight, which identified the former vapor degreaser pipeline utility trench as the TCE source area. The site was listed on the National Priorities List in July 2000.

In the spring of 2002, FAG Bearings initiated Removal Actions to address the principal threat waste of TCE contaminated soils in the utility trench. In situ chemical oxidation was used to destroy the TCE contamination. Soil excavation was conducted in other areas of the FAG Bearings property to remove impacted soils that were not a major contributor to the sources of aquifer contamination. These actions were completed in June 2003, and the Record of Decision was finalized in September 2004, selecting monitored natural attenuation in groundwater as the remedy.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The long-term remedy included institutional controls to prevent use of contaminated groundwater, monitored natural attenuation and monitoring. Natural attenuation describes a variety of in-place processes that, under favorable conditions, act without human intervention to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume or concentration of contaminants in groundwater.

Institutional controls to prevent contact with the groundwater are in place. Groundwater monitoring to evaluate natural attenuation at the site is on-going.

The Third Five-Year Review was completed in April 2024. Five-Year Reviews are conducted where hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants on site remain above levels that allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. The remedy protectiveness was determined to be short-term protective. The remedy is currently protective of human health and the environment because most of the contaminated soil at the site has been addressed through excavation and ISCO injections. Residents in areas of impacted groundwater have been offered connection to public water supply, and institutional controls are in place that restrict the installation of domestic wells into the contaminated portions of the shallow groundwater and the Mississippian Aquifer. In order to be protective long-term, additional ISCO injections may be needed at the source area.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MoDNR) enacted state regulation 10 CSR 23-3.090 as a regional institutional control in 1987, designating Special Area 2 under Water Well Construction Code. This regulation restricts the installation of domestic wells into the contaminated portion of the Mississippian Aquifer and identifies minimum casing requirements when drilling to the Ordovician Aquifer to prevent cross contamination between contaminated portions of the Mississippian Aquifer and the deeper aquifers. On February 28, 2019, revisions to 10 CSR 23-3.090 became effective. Special Area 2 is now designated as Area 11. These changes restrict the installation of new shallow wells within impact areas. New shallow wells may be drilled outside of an impact area; however, laboratory analysis of TCE and its degredation products are required along with quantification of lead and cadmium. The revised rule also inhibits the mixing of the upper and lower aquifers; therefore, sufficient casing must be installed into the deeper aquifer through the Ozark Confining Unit. Anyone interested in installing or deepening a well in or around Special Area 11 is highly encouraged to contact the Missouri Geological Survey for additional information as advance notice is required prior to any major reconstruction of wells located within Special Area 11.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The site is sampled on an annual basis to collect environmental data and to evaluate the effectivness of the monitored natural attenuation.
