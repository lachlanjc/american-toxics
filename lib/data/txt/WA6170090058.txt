### Background

The Naval Air Station (NAS), Whidbey Island (Seaplane Base) site is located on Whidbey Island, Washington, at the northern edge of the Puget Sound. NAS Whidbey Island (Seaplane Base) is one of two separate sites located on Whidbey Island. The second site is referred to as NAS, Whidbey Island (Ault Field). Since the 1940s, operations at the air station have generated a variety of hazardous wastes.

NAS Whidbey Island was commissioned on September 21, 1942. Originally, NAS Whidbey Island was used for seaplane patrol operations, rocket firing training, torpedo overhaul, and both recruit and Petty Officer training. After World War II, the facility was placed on reduced operating status and, in December 1949, was upgraded to increase its Pacific Fleet support capabilities.

Major waste-generating activities at the Seaplane Base involved aircraft and vehicle maintenance, painting and paint stripping, and machine and boat shop activities. Wastes generated included solvents, zinc chromate, lead-containing paint wastes, thinners, acid and lead-based sealants. Site activities and waste disposal practices contaminated soil, groundwater and surface water with hazardous chemicals.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires maintenance of land use controls.

EPA placed the site on the NPL in 1990. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1995.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The Seaplane Base site consisted of five waste areas, including a landfill, salvage yard and three uncontained spills. The site’s long-term remedy included excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil and land use controls. Remedy construction took place between 1994 and 1995. There are no maintenance or monitoring requirements. Land use control inspections take place routinely.
