Background
The 40-acre Duell & Gardner Landfill site is located in Dalton Township, Michigan. From the 1940s to 1975, a municipal landfill operated on site. The site contained about 500 drums in various stages of deterioration, hundreds of laboratory bottles, areas of refuse and debris, and piles of unidentified sludge-like material. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, the groundwater treatment system shut down in June 2010; contaminant levels remain under cleanup goals. The treatment system was decommissioned in 2012. Long Term Remedial Action by EPA completed in 2012.  On August 29, 2012 the site was formallly transferred to MDEQ to continue peration and maintenance activities under the state's oversight.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through State of Michigan response actions.EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review, which took place in 2015, concluded that the remedy at the Site is protective of human health and the environment because impacted soils have been removed; wastes have been consolidated into a 4-acre landfill and covered with an impermeable cover; groundwater is currently meeting Michigan Part 201 and Part 22 water standards and no longer needs treatment; and ICs to restrict current and future use of the Site and to ensure long-term stewardship have been implemented.  ICs in the form of an environmental covenant are in place for the Sie.  The IC Plan ensures Long-Term Stewardship because it establishes a process to ensure that ICs are in place, maintained, and effective.EPA declared the site Sitewide Ready for Anticipated Reuse in 2008. The site is now eligible for deletion from the NPL.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site’s long-term remedy included oil excavation with off-site disposal, groundwater extraction and treatment, and on-site consolidation and capping of contaminated soils. The remedy became operational and functional in August 2002. Based on groundwater sampling analysis that showed no groundwater contaminants above cleanup levels, EPA and MDEQ determined that the groundwater treatment system could shut down. The groundwater treatment system shut down in June 2010; contaminant levels remain under cleanup goals. The treatment system was decommissioned in 2012. Long Term Remedial Action by EPA completed in 2012.  On August 29, 2012 the site was formallly transferred to MDEQ to continue peration and maintenance activities under the state's oversight.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Materials found on the site included: approximately 500 drums in various stages of deterioration, hundreds of laboratory bottles, areas of refuse and debris, and piles of unidentified sludge-like material. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, aniline, and N,N-dimethylaniline, were detected in onsite groundwater. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), crystal violet, aniline, and N,N-dimethylaniline were detected in onsite soil No digital information

Emergency Response and Removal
Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions in 1986 disposed of about 550 drums, the laboratory bottles, sludge-like material, and general refuse and debris.
