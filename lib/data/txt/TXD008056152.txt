### Background

The Texarkana Wood Preserving Company (TWPC) is a 26-acre wood-treating site located at 1001 Lubbock Street in Texarkana, Texas. Since the early 1900s, the Site used creosote and pentachlorophenol (PCP) as the source material for wood preserving operations to treat wood against bacterial and insect damage. The site ceased operations and closed in August 1984. It was listed to the NPL on June 10, 1986. Several remedial investigations were conducted from listing to the most recent in 2011 to delineate the lateral and vertical extent of the source material and associated dissolved ground water contaminant plumes. Investigations found creosote and PCP product and a ground water contaminant plume in the shallow aquifer. Although the contaminant plume extended from the Site to approximately 400 feet of Days Creek, the creek has never received or been affected by the contaminant ground water.

The September 14, 2010 ROD Amendment addressed the Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (DNAPL) source material (creosote and PCP) and contaminated shallow soils. The September 26, 2011 ROD Amendment addressed the ground water plume through Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA), which requires monitoring to document that natural attenuation is degrading the plume, and that the plume is receding onto the Site. The 2011 ROD Amendment implemented containment of the shallow ground water plume associated with the two source material areas. The remedial actions (cleanup) documented in the ROD Amendments were implemented from February 6, 2012 through September 13, 2012.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Excavation of contaminated shallow soils and solidification of the source material (creosote and PCP) in groundwater during the 2012 remedial action/cleanup has stopped the source material from delivering dissolved contaminants to the groundwater. Groundwater sampling/analytical data is collected every year and has documented that the groundwater plume is degrading and has receded onto the site.

Investigation began at the site by state environmental agencies in 1968 after it was reported that there were effluent discharges into Days Creek. Owners were found to be either negligent or delinquent in permitting requirements from 1968 until the Site closed in 1984. Subsequently, the Texas Department of Water Resources, a predecessor of the TCEQ, submitted the Site for clean-up under EPA’s Superfund program. Potential contamination of shallow ground water, which is considered potential drinking water sources by the State (i.e., Class 2 – private drinking water wells), and surface water runoff from the ponds were the major concerns. The EPA conducted an initial Remedial Investigation (RI) and three (3) Supplemental RIs at the Site from 1989 to 2010. Results confirmed contamination in the soil and the shallow ground water. EPA conducted the remedial action/cleanup from February to September 2012. EPA is presently monitoring the ground water.Investigation began at the site by state environmental agencies in 1968 after it was reported that there were effluent discharges into Days Creek.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) developed and implemented a remedy, which addressed source material and contaminated soils and protected deep groundwater.The remedial action was completed in 2012. The Site is presently in Long Term Response Action (LTRA), which requires EPA to monitor the ground water to document that the plume is not migrating offsite and is degrading, and to maintain the integrity of the on-site consolidation cell. Ground water sampling/analytical data, following the Remedial Action (the cleanup) has documented that the plume is degrading and receding, indicating that the RA was effective. The affected surface soils were excavated, placed in an on-site Consolidation Cell, and the excavations were backfilled with clean soil. Ground water migration is under control; the contaminated ground water plume has not, and has never, reached/affected Days Creek, which is located to the East of the Site. Institutional Controls (ICs), in the form of restrictive covenants, are in-place and restrict ground water access, excavations below two feet in some areas and restrict the property to industrial/commercial use only – non-residential. The most recent Five Year Review Report, developed in 2016, documents the continued integrity of the remedy.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The s ite is presently in Long Term Response Action (LTRA), which requires EPA to monitor the ground water to document that the plume is not migrating offsite and is degrading, and to maintain the integrity of the on-site consolidation cell. The Site is inpsected each year to confirm the integrity and continued effectiveness of the remedy. Ground water samples are collected from all monitoring wells on and offsite to document that the contaminant plume is degrading and that the plume is receding. In general, ground water is analyzed for creosote constituents (PAHs), and PCP and its degradation products. In depth inspections are conducted every five years to confirm the continued integrity of the remedy; a Five Year Review Report is developed to document the findings of that inspetion. The most recent Five Year Report was developed in 2016.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. EPA conducted five removal actions from December 1986 to October 1990 to address contamination and potential off-site releases. Removal actions are short-term action, while remedial actions can encompass years.
