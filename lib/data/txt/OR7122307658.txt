### Background

The Fremont National Forest/White King and Lucky Lass Uranium Mines (USDA) site is located in Lake County, Oregon. The site encompasses 140 acres affected by uranium mining activities during the 1950s and 1960s. The site consists of two former uranium mines, the White King Mine and the Lucky Lass Mine, located within one mile of each other. Mining operations at the site between the 1950s and 1960s, and the waste materials left on site following mining operations, contaminated soil, surface water, sediment and groundwater with heavy metals and radioactive constituents. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

The White King Mine is located approximately 18 miles northwest of Lakeview within the Lakeview Ranger District, Fremont National Forest, Lake County, Oregon. The mine is situated on both National Forest land and private land. The Lucky Lass Mine is situated 1-mile northwest of the White King Mine and is also on National Forest land. The site encompasses 140 acres affected by uranium mining activities which occurred during the 1950s and 1960s.

Major features at the White King Mine include the White King Pond (formed when water collected in an open-pit mine), and two stockpiles of overburden material. The White King pond occupies approximately 13 acres and contains about 80 million gallons of water. The two stockpiles contain a combined volume of almost one million cubic yards of material. The White King pond contains acidic water which requires periodic neutralization.

Major features at the Lucky Lass Mine include the Lucky Lass Pond and the overburden stockpile. This pond covers approximately 5 acres. The Lucky Lass overburden stockpile covers about 14 acres and contains approximately 260,000 cubic yards of material. The radioactive ore and soil stockpiles at the site pose some risk to residents or recreational users. The White King pond contains acidic water which requires periodic neutralization.

After the ROD was signed in September 2001, EPA completed negotiations with Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) to conduct the Remedial Design and Remedial Action. A Consent Decree was published in the federal register October 26, 2005 for a 30-day comment period. Pursuant to a Unilateral Administrative Order the PRPs completed the remedial design in Spring 2005 and began cleanup work in the Summer of 2005. The PRPs finished the work in 2006.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA has an Interagency Agreement with the US Forest Service to conduct annual operation and maintenance inspections and annual groundwater, pond water, and Augur Creek monitoring. The inspections typically verify the integrity of site fences, the success of the revegetation of the stockpile covers, and that no trees are growing on the covers. The five-year review will document the issues found during each annual inspection and will make recommendations of actions needed to ensure that the remedy remains protective.

Land use restrictions (institutional controls) are in place. Land use restrictions protect people and animals from being exposed to contaminants at the site and keep the site intact. Fencing and restricting activities such as grazing or off-road vehicle use protects the wetlands and the vegetative covers on the stockpiles of contaminated mining materials. Water from wells and other water sources may not meet safe water quality standards and cannot be used as a drinking water source. Any long- term site use, such as permanent camping sites, are not allowed. Due to the nature of the contaminants (radionuclides) use restrictions are expected to remain in place indefinitely. An optimization study was completed in 2021 that will guide future operation and maintenance activities at the Site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The siteâ€™s long-term remedy included recontouring the White King Protore Stockpile; removing and placing off-pile contaminated soil on the regraded Protore Stockpile (or consolidated stockpile); excavating the White King Overburden Stockpile and placing excavated materials on the consolidated stockpile; and placing 20 inches of cover soil on portions of the consolidated stockpile. Additional cleanup actions included placing final covers at the White King consolidated stockpile; recontouring and covering the Lucky Lass Overburden stockpile; institutional controls and constructing a wetland near the former White King overburden stockpile. Remedy construction took place between 2005 and 2006. Site operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.  

### Sampling and Monitoring

Groundwater, pond, and creek monitoring is conducted periodically.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions between 1995 and 1996 included the installation of erosion control measures to protect the ore and soil stockpiles, and to prevent further spreading of contaminants to site soils and the creek.
