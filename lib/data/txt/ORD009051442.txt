### Background

The 12-acre Allied Plating, Inc. site is in NE Portland, Oregon near the Columbia Slough. A chrome-plating facility operated on site between 1957 and the late 1980s. Plating activities and waste disposal practices contaminated ground water, surface water, sludge and soil with heavy metals and other hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1994.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Allied Plating, Inc., started operating a chrome-plating facility in Portland, Multnomah County, Oregon, in 1957. For over 25 years, the company discharged wastes without treatment into an unlined pond on-site. EPA placed the site on the NPL in 1990 and conducted a Remedial Investigation at the site between January 1990 and April 1992. The investigation determined that the contamination of the site was mainly limited to the layer of plating waste formed in the surface of the pond area. The site was remediated under a Removal Action between October 20 and November 10, 1992. The plating waste in the impoundment area was excavated and shipped off site for disposal.

After the Removal Action, a risk assessment concluded that the site no longer posed an unacceptable risk. A "no further action" Record of Decision that maintained existing Institutional Controls on the use of shallow groundwater was signed in 1993. The site was deleted from the National Priorities List on November 11, 1994.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1992, EPA removal actions included excavation and off-site disposal of 1,100 cubic yards of contaminated soil and sludge.

In 1993, EPA determined that no further actions were required. However, to ensure that ground water is not used in the future, EPA required that the property owner place a restriction on the deed to prevent future ground water use.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The most recent review also determined that ground water use restrictions are no longer required, and that the site is safe for unrestricted use and unlimited exposure. EPA plans to issue an Explanation of Significant Differences to document this conclusion.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The 2013 Five-Year Review concluded that soils at the site are safe for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. The review also concluded that no restrictions were needed for site groundwater, although EPA believed that it was prudent to keep the restrictions on the aquifer in place. The Troutdale Aquifer is located 10 feet below ground surface (10 feet above mean sea level) in the impoundment area.

Currently the site is used for commercial/industrial purposes.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Based on the limited area of contamination, lack of evidence of contaminant migration since plant operations ceased, and plans to remove the remaining contaminant source, EPA concluded that no groundwater cleanup or further monitoring was necessary. The last groundwater monitoring took place in 1990-1991 during the Remedial Investigation.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site cleanup included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, from October-November 1992, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment.
