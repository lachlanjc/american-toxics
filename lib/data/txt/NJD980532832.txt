### Background

The Friedman Property site is located in Upper Freehold Township, New Jersey. The three-acre area is an open vacant lot with scrub vegetation. Drums and liquids were dumped into a ditch at the site in the late 1950s and 1960s. Groundwater underlying this abandoned property was suspected to contain a number of contaminants. The site was one of four Superfund sites within a two-mile radius. Following a remedial investigation that found no significant contamination at the site, or evidence that contamination had migrated from the site, EPA selected "no further action" for the site’s remedy in 1985. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in March 1986.

The approximately three-acre Friedman Property is an open, vacant lot with scrub vegetation. Drums and liquids were dumped into a ditch at the site in the late 1950s and 1960s. Groundwater underlying this abandoned site was suspected to contain a number of contaminants. The Friedman Property was one of four Superfund sites within a two-mile radius. The site is in a rural area with scattered residences, commercial facilities, and several trailer parks, all dependent on local groundwater as the source of drinking water. The site is bordered by an unnamed tributary to Lahaway Creek, a single-family residential property, and New Jersey State Routes 537 and 539. Site Responsibility: This site was addressed through Federal and State actions.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was deleted from the National Priorities List in March 1986. As a precautionary measure, annual monitoring of the existing on-site groundwater monitoring wells was required for a period of five years. The results of this sampling, which was conducted by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) between 1986 and 1993, confirmed the RI finding that significant contamination of the underlying groundwater no longer exists. Therefore, no further sampling will be conducted.

A five-year review for the site was completed in August 1998. EPA confirmed that an environmental restriction was placed on the property’s deed to prohibit excavation without prior NJDEP approval. This review concluded that no further reviews were necessary.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Following a remedial investigation that found no significant contamination at the site, or evidence that contamination had migrated from the site, EPA selected "no further action" for the site’s remedy in 1985. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in March 1986.  

EPA recommended that the State of New Jersey request that the local authorities place deed restrictions on future uses of the property.
