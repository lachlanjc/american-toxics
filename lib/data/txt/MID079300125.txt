### Background

The 5-acre Spartan Chemical Co. site was a bulk chemical transfer and repackaging plant from 1952 to 1991. Prior to 1963, the company discharged its wastewater into the ground. Chemical spillage and leaks from underground storage tanks also contributed to soil and groundwater contamination.

The soil and groundwater are contaminated with metals and several organic compounds including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PCBs), ethylbenzene, toluene, benzene, and xylene. The company was the only known handler of solvents in the area, so Spartan was thought to be the source. In 1981, residential wells near the site were found to be contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

Residents of the city of Wyoming are connected to the public water supply system providing Lake Michigan water, so there are no immediate health threats associated with this site. However, soil contamination exists outside the fenced property boundary, and groundwater contamination continues to move. A city-owned park, which has a lake used for recreational activities, is located downgradient.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s long-term cleanup calls for restricting groundwater use and land use, excavating and disposing of highly contaminated soil, treating remaining soil on-site, using technologies called soil vapor extraction and air sparging, and monitoring natural attenuation. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) started the cleanup in 2014. However, additional contamination was discovered in 2015, which required more investigation.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The preparation for cleanup of contaminated soil on the southern portion of the property began in 2020. Soil removal is scheduled to be completed by 2022.

Because EGLE found that the original cleanup would not fully protect people or the environment, EGLE is investigating:

- the potential vapor intrusion pathway at nearby properties
- the extent of PCBs and metals in soil
- the concentration and volume of soil that needs to be excavated
- a pilot study excavation method that controls the release of VOCs into the air

These actions should be completed in 2021. At that time, EGLE will determine what more needs to be done to ensure that people and the environment are protected.

EGLE, in partnership with EPA, completed a five-year-review of Spartan Chemical in 2017. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This was the second five-year review of this site.

This review, which determined the cleanup is not protective, included an evaluation of background information, cleanup requirements, effectiveness of the cleanup, and maintenance and monitoring efforts. It also looked at ways to operate more efficiently.

The next review is scheduled for 2022.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Groundwater and soils that are contaminated with VOCs are most likely due to chemical spillage and leaks from underground storage tanks. The soil and groundwater are contaminated with over 25 organic compounds, including ethylbenzene, toluene, benzene, xylene, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane. Currently, there are no immediate health threats associated with this site. However, soil contamination exists outside of the fenced property boundary, and groundwater contamination continues to migrate. A city-owned park, which has a lake used for recreational activities, is located downstream of the site. Residents of the City of Wyoming are connected to the public water supply system providing Lake Michigan water.
