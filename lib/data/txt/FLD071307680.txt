### Background

The two-acre Gold Coast Oil Corp. site is located in Miami, Florida. It includes the area where Gold Coast Oil operated an oil and solvent reclamation facility and bulk storage area from the early 1970s to 1982. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983 because of contaminated groundwater and soil resulting from facility operations. EPA, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and CSX Transportation, the site’s primary potentially responsible party (PRP), investigated site conditions and took steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination.

The PRP removed nearly 900 tons of contaminated soils and treated over 80 million gallons of water. After the PRP completed cleanup activities, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1996. The Agency completed the site’s final Five-Year Review in 2001. EPA does not expect additional work to be performed at the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Gold Coast Oil (GCO) site is a 2-acre facility that formerly operated as an oil and solvent reclamation facility and bulk storage area. The site property was owned by CSX Transportation (formerly Seaboard Coast Line), who leased the property to Gold Coast Oil in the early 1970s. Site operations occurred from the early 1970s until 1982, when the company lost its lease due to regulatory violations.

Poor operations management practices and improper disposal of wastes resulted in extensive contamination of surface and subsurface soils at the site. The underlying Biscayne aquifer, a sole source of drinking water for Dade County, was also contaminated in excess of Federal and State Drinking Water Standards.

- The GCO site is located in a mixed commercial, industrial, and residential area in Miami, Florida. It is bordered on the north and west by railroad tracks, on the south by a group of small businesses and on the east by SW 71st Avenue.
- The site’s primary PRP, CSX Transportation, led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and FDEP.
- In 1982, the site owner, CSX Transportation, evicted Gold Coast Oil from the property and agreed to voluntarily clean up the site. In 1983, the state requested that EPA take the lead at the site.
- In 1989, CSX Transportation began soil cleanup activities and completed them the following year. In 1990, the PRP implemented a comprehensive system of groundwater monitoring, recovery and disposal. The groundwater recovery and treatment system reduced contaminants in the underlying water to within federal and state drinking water standards. In 1996, EPA took the site off the NPL.
- EPA completed the site’s last Five-Year Review in 2001, and found that the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.
- EPA does not anticipate additional work at the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1987, EPA issued the site’s cleanup plan. It included digging up and disposing of hardened waste sludge off site; digging up and stabilizing surface soils contaminated with VOCs and metals and disposing of them on site; and installing a groundwater recovery, treatment and disposal system for the cleanup of VOCs in groundwater. In 1994, EPA revised the cleanup plan to change the groundwater cleanup level for tetrachloroethene.

No future work is anticipated at the site. The site has been deleted from the NPL and the last FYR for the site was in 2001.

### Sampling and Monitoring

No future work is anticipated at the site. The site has been deleted from the NPL and the last FYR for the site was in 2001.

### Enforcement Information

A Consent Decree for the site was issued in 1988.
