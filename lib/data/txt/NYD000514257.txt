### Background

The Niagara County Refuse site is located in the Town of Wheatfield, New York. The 65-acre site is an inactive landfill. The Niagara County Refuse Disposal District operated the landfill from 1969 until 1976, when it was officially closed. Large amounts of municipal and industrial solid and chemical wastes are buried on the site. After closure in 1976, exposed waste was covered with about 20 inches of soil and clay, and the site was graded. The Town of Wheatfield acquired the site in 1976. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in July 2004. Long-term monitoring is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Long-term Cleanup: After a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the nature and extent of site contamination and to evaluate remedial alternatives, EPA selected a remedy for the site in a September 1993 ROD. The remedy called for regrading the landfill, construction of a landfill cap and a leachate collection system, off-site treatment of collected leachate, construction of a gas venting system beneath the cap, deed and access restrictions, and groundwater and surface water monitoring to track any contaminant migration from the landfill.

The perimeter collection system was installed in 1998 and 1999. Cap construction finished in 2000. EPA determined that all construction activities were complete at the site in June 2000. The completed cleanup includes the containment of about 3.1 million tons of contaminated material and the treatment of 35,118 pounds per year of leachate. Routine operation and maintenance activities at the site are ongoing. Operation, maintenance and monitoring reports are provided to EPA quarterly and the monitoring data collected confirm that the cap and leachate collection system are operating as designed.

A five-year review of the remedy was conducted by EPA in 2003, 2008, and 2014 and each review concluded that contamination at the site is under control and there is no exposure to human or environmental receptors from site-related contaminants due to permanent measures in place at the site. Based on its review of the monitoring data, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in July 2004. EPA continues to monitor conditions at the site to ensure that the remedy remains protective of human health and the environment. The fourth five-year review of the remedy was completed in July 2019.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in a single long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.

An investigation of the nature and extent of the contamination at the site was completed by a group of potentially responsible parties under EPA oversight in 1991. In 1993, EPA selected a remedy for the site in a Record of Decision, or ROD. The remedy called for regrading the landfill, construction of a landfill cap and a leachate collection system, off-site treatment of collected leachate, construction of a gas venting system beneath the cap, deed and access restrictions, and groundwater and surface water monitoring to track any contaminant migration from the landfill. The remedial design was completed in 1997 and onsite cleanup began in 1998.

In June 2000 EPA determined that all construction activities were completed at the site. Based on its review of the monitoring data collected following completion of the remedial action, EPA deleted the site from the National Priorities List in July 2004. EPA continues to monitor conditions at the site to ensure that the remedy remains protective. The last five-year review of the site was completed by EPA in June 2024, which concluded that the remedies implemented at the site remain protective of human health and the environment. The next five-year review will be completed by June 2029.
