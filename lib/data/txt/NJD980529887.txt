### Background

The Vineland State School is located in Vineland, New Jersey. The 195-acre area was a residential and treatment facility for mentally handicapped women. The State's Department of Human Services ran the facility. The school operated an unregulated incinerator and landfill on the property to dispose of its waste. The incinerator has been dismantled and the pit was filled in and graded. Incinerator and landfilling operations contaminated site soils and groundwater with hazardous chemicals, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Immediate actions to protect human health and the environment cleaned up the site. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in May 1998.

The Vineland Developmental Center has been a residential treatment facility for mentally handicapped women since the late 1800s. The site property consists of five distinct subsites, where the following activities took place: (1) the school allegedly dumped between 6,000 and 8,000 one-quart containers of mercury-based pesticides into ponded water, about 20 feet below the ground surface; (2) an on-site contractor spilled about 150 gallons of PCB-laced transformer oil onto the ground when four large transformers were removed in the mid-1970s; (3) starting in the 1950s, the school used a part of the site as a general dump for any type of wastes, including chemicals produced and used at the school; (4) during the early to mid-1950s, the school dumped an unknown amount of transformer oil laced with PCBs from out-of-service electrical transformers; and (5) about 10 cubic yards of pesticides, and possibly other chemicals the school used for farming, may have been dumped into a 10-foot-deep pit during the 1950s. The State of New Jersey investigated a PCB spill that occurred in subsite 2, which led to an extensive cleanup of PCB-contaminated soil, building rubble, concrete and construction material, soil contaminated with gasoline, and asbestos roofing.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

After studying conditions at the Vineland State School site, the EPA and the State determined that the actions already taken to provide the affected area residences with a safe alternate drinking water supply and the low contaminant levels in the remaining areas of contamination did not warrant any further cleanup actions at the site. The Vineland State School site is being closely monitored to ensure that the steps taken to clean up subsite 2 remain effective. A Close Out Report, the first step in the NPL site delisting process, was signed by the Regional Administrator in September 1992. The Notice of Intent to Delete was published in the Federal Register in August 1996. The final deletion notice was published in the Federal Register on May 7 1998.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site was addressed in two stages: immediate actions and a long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.  

In 1988, the NJDEP removed PCB-contaminated soil at subsite 2 and capped the area. After studying conditions at the Vineland State School site, the EPA and the State determined that the actions already taken to provide the affected area residences with a safe alternate drinking water supply and the low contaminant levels in the remaining areas of contamination did not warrant any further cleanup actions at the site.

A Close Out Report, the first step in the NPL site delisting process, was signed by the Regional Administrator in September 1992. EPA took the site off the National Priorities List in May 1998.

The State will monitor groundwater and the disposal areas on site to make sure the cleanup effort is effective and that the groundwater under the site remains free of contaminants.
