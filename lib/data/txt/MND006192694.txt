### Background

The MacGillis & Gibbs Co. and the Bell Lumber & Pole Co. site consists of 68-acres of adjoining properties in New Brighton, Minnesota. Both the MacGillis & Gibbs Co. and the Bell Lumber & Pole Co. companies operated wood treatment plants since the early 1920s. Both plants also used creosote and pentachlophenol (PCP) as a preservative. MacGillis & Gibbs Co. had been using chromated copper arsenate (CCA), since 1970. Dioxin was also found onsite. Wood preserving operations at the Site resulted in the discharge of contaminants to the soils. In 1979, an initial investigation was conducted at the MacGillis & Gibb site after a spill of around 5000 gallons of CCA. Significant contamination of the disposal area was found as well as around the CCA and PCP process areas and in the groundwater beneath the Site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA listed the site on the National Priorities List ins 1984. The NPL is the list of the nation’s most hazardous wastes sites that are eligible for federal funding. The site is being addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions with oversight provided by EPA and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA).

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s cleanup remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies function as intended by site decision documents put in place to protect public health and the environment. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA. The remedy for the soil cleanup continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The remedy for the groundwater continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires achievement of groundwater cleanup goals. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has recently completed the fifth five-year review of the site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.

EPA is also changing the groundwater treatment system at the site. This change is being made because the original system was approaching the end of its effective lifecycle, as noted in the 2016 five-year review for the site. The new treatment system will provide similar performance and increased reliability with anticipated decreased operating costs.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Groundwater, sediments, and soils are contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), PCP, and heavy metals such as copper, chromium, and arsenic. Although municipal wells are not contaminated, site contaminants have been detected in a few private wells. The owners of these wells have stated that they do not consume water from those wells. The 2011 Five-Year Review Report concluded there was no evidence of current exposures.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions in 1993 disposed of 683 drums of solids and 28 drums of liquids containing creosote, PCP and dioxins from the MacGillis & Gibbs Co. facility.
