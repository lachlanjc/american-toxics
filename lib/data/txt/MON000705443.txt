### Background

The Southwest Jefferson County Mining site includes all of Jefferson County, Missouri, excluding the Herculaneum Site. Jefferson County is located on the northern portion of an area known as the Old Lead Belt where mining began in the early 1700s. Mine waste has contaminated soil, sediment, surface water and groundwater at the site with heavy metals, primarily lead. Mine waste has also been transported by the Big River and manually relocated to other areas throughout Jefferson County. In residential properties, this material has been used as topsoil, fill material and aggregate for roads. The site is separated into eight Operable Units.OUs 1-3 includes the residential properties.OU4 includes the Big River and flood plain, OU-5 includes Groundwater, OU6 is the Valles Mines Site, OU7 is the Rail Lines and OU8 is the mine waste piles. The EPA work at the OUs is on a priority basis based on the potential for human health and environmental risks.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Sampling and assessment work began at the site in 2004 and additional assessment work continued in 2007. Since November 2007, the EPA has conducted removal activities consisting of excavation and disposal of residential soils (OU1, 2 and 3) exceeding 1,200 parts ppm and child care facilities with soils exceeding 400 ppm. The site was listed on the National Priorities List on Sept. 23, 2009. The Record of Decision for residential yards at the site was completed in September 2012. The remedy includes the excavation, backfill and revegetation of lead-contaminated residential soil exceeding 400 ppm lead. The ROD also includes health education for residents and the establishment of institutional controls to safeguard future residential development and protect remediated residential properties from lead recontamination. The first Five Year Review for the site was completed June 19, 2020. The second Five-Year Review is currently being conducted and planned for completion in June 2025.

In addition to remediation of lead contaminated soils, the EPA is also working to increase public awareness to protect residents from exposure to heavy metals and is collaborating with the community to safeguard future residential development and protect remediated residential properties from lead recontamination. Health and fish advisory signs are being placed along access points to the Big River where elevated levels of lead in the sediment have been detected. The EPA is working with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services and Jefferson County Health Department, as well as other state and federal agencies.

This site is one of many across the country to receive funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which invested $3.5 billion in environmental remediation at Superfund sites on the National Priorities List. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding will be used to conduct cleanup of lead contaminated soil at residential properties. This work includes sampling, excavation and off-site disposal of the site’s remaining lead-contaminated soils and sediments.

Operable Unit 1 (Residential Yards): As of December 2024, the EPA has sampled over 7,121 residential properties and remediated more than 1,773 properties. Sampling and remediation work are ongoing and is expected to continue until the remedial action objectives are met.

Operable Unit 4 (Big River and Floodplain): In the summer of 2019, the EPA sent over 1,100 notices of potential contamination and request for floodplain sampling letters to the owners of land along the impacted length of the Big River. Over 250 sampling access agreements were received and sampling began in August 2019. More than 2,000 samples were collected from over190 properties characterized in this effort. Assessment and data analysis are on-going and anticipated to be complete by the end of 2025.

A Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study for the river and floodplain is ongoing. Multiple studies are incorporated into the RI/FS, including an Ecological Risk Assessment, Human Health Risk Assessment and Treatability Studies (also called pilot projects). While the RI/FS is ongoing, a Non-Time-Critical Removal Action is being initiated and the Engineering Evaluation and Cost Analysis is anticipated to be complete in 2025.

Operable Unit 5 (Groundwater): The EPA recently finalized an interim Record of Decision for assisting the owners of wells impacted by lead and other heavy metals. Over 1,300 private residential wells have been sampled throughout the county, with more than 130 of these having concentrations exceeding the lead action level of 15 parts per billion. A small number of wells also exceed the EPA's Maximum Contaminant Limits for other heavy metals, including cadmium, chromium, barium and arsenic. For many years, the EPA has been offering bottled water to impacted property owners. The IROD requires replacing bottled water with Point-of-Use water treatment filters that will be connected to residents' kitchen taps. Additional POU filters can be elsewhere in a residence for young children individuals with special needs. Several years' worth of replacement filters are also provided. Sampling of private residential groundwater wells will continue. As additional contaminated wells are discovered, the owners also will be offered POU units.

Operable Unit 6 (Valles Mines): The EPA is currently in the early stages of conducting a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study at the Valles Mines site.

Operable Unit 7 (Railbeds): The EPA is currently in the early stages of investigation of abandoned railroad lines used in association with the mining and milling processes in the Old Lead Belt.

Operable Unit 8 (Mine Waste Piles): The EPA is currently in the early stages of conducting a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

At this site, activity and use limitations that the EPA calls institutional controls have not been implemented. However, the public should be aware that lead contaminated soils and sediments have been identified throughout the Big River watershed and residents should exercise caution when recreating in these areas or handling/hauling materials from these locations.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Removal actions, or short-term cleanups, at the site included excavation of contaminated soils at over 350 properties and provision of an alternative drinking water supply for affected residences.

A Time-Critical Removal Action is planned to start in 2025 to cleanup residential yard soils at priority properties.
