Background
The Fike Chemical site is located in Nitro, West Virginia. The site consists of two parcels; an 11-acre parcel where chemical processing took place and a 1-acre parcel containing the former Cooperative Sewage Treatment (CST) plant. The CST plant treated stormwater and wastewater generated by the Fike Chemical plant. The site owner disposed of hazardous materials by burying them or placing them in on-site lagoons. Operations at the ﻿site ended in 1988, but contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. The site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List in 1983. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party actions.  The ﻿site’s long-term remedy included dismantling, decontamination and removal of all remaining tanks, equipment and structures; off-site disposal of drums, tanks, contaminated sludge and wastes; construction of a new wastewater treatment plant to manage surface water; construction of an asphalt cap; and groundwater treatment. Remedy construction began in 1989 and most construction activities were completed by 2011.  The site has been divided into multiple operable units (OUs), or separate units, to facilitate the cleanup. OU1: EPA selected a remedy to address the most threatening hazards to human health and the environment in the site's September 1988 OU1 Record of Decision ﻿(ROD). The remedy included removal and disposal of materials found in various tanks, drums, lines and vessels located on the site, drainage and stabilization of the on-site and Cooperative Sewage Treatment (CST) facility lagoons, treatment of the drained liquids from the lagoons and discharge of those treated liquids to the Kanawha River. This work was completed in 1993. OU2: EPA selected a remedy to address risks posed by site structures in the September 1990 OU2 ROD. The selected remedy included the dismantling and decontamination of all tanks and equipment and most of the on-site buildings. This work was completed in 1996. OU3: In the site's March 1992 OU3 ROD, EPA selected a remedy of excavation and off-site disposal to address risks posed by buried drums and containers at the site. EPA modified the means of achieving selected remedy for OU3 in two Explanations of Significant Differences (ESDs) in May 1993 and January 1996. This work was completed in 1997. OU4: EPA selected a remedy to address soil and groundwater contamination in the site’s September 2001 OU4 ROD. The remedy included excavation and disposal of the excavated material at an off-site facility, construction an asphalt cap, extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater, and implementation of institutional controls to prevent exposure to contaminated groundwater and ensure that the future use of the land remains industrial use only. Soil excavation, installation of the multilayer asphalt cap was completed in 2003. Institutional controls were put in place in 2011. The remedy also included investigation of the extent of groundwater contamination. EPA revised the groundwater component of the OU4 remedy in the site 's December 2006 ROD Amendment. The ROD Amendment eliminated the requirement to extract and treat groundwater and selected in-situ biosparging to address groundwater contamination. A biosparging system operated on-site from 2007 until April 2015. Sampling data indicated that biosparging alone was not effective in reducing all contaminant of concern (COCs) concentrations, and especially ineffective in reducing concentrations of hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA). EPA therefore requested the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) shut down the biosparging system and develop a new feasibility study (FS) for the Site to investigate alternative groundwater remedy options. In 2016, the PRPs developed an updated groundwater Conceptual Site Model (CSM) and used those findings to develop the Site’s 2016 draft Groundwater FS Report. The 2016 draft FS identified and evaluated groundwater remedial alternatives for the Site. Upon review, EPA requested the 2016 Draft FS be updated and revised to reflect restoration of groundwater to beneficial use as a primary objective, and groundwater remediation strategies to address the affected areas. In 2021, the PRPs completed an initial technology screening (ITS) to review and evaluate previously identified technologies (i.e., those carried forward in the 2016 FS) and possibly new technologies or technology refinements that came to market since the 2016 FS. New technologies and technology refinements were identified during the ITS that warranted additional consideration before proceeding with the FS. Therefore, EPA approved proceeding with a Technology Evaluation in February 2022. The Technology Evaluation is currently underway and included laboratory treatability studies to evaluate both sorption-based and oxidation-based technologies as well as multi-media sampling to understand current on-site conditions.

What Is the Current Site Status?
Evaluation of potential groundwater remedies is ongoing. In an effort to prevent migration of COCs into uncontaminated parts of the aquifer, EPA intends to select an interim remedy which will be documented in a future decision document. Information and data collected throughout this interim effort will facilitate the selection of a final comprehensive groundwater remedy, focusing on restoring groundwater to beneficial use. Once the technology evaluation and treatability studies are complete, the PRPs will begin preparing the Draft Interim Feasibility Study. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent, 2022 Five-Year Review (PDF), concluded that the remedy for OU1, OU2, and OU3 continue to be protective of human health and the environment. The remedy for OU4 is protective of human health and the environment in the short term because exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks are being controlled. EPA anticipates selecting a new groundwater remedy in the near future to address remaining groundwater contamination at the site. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2027. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
The site's remedy requires institutional controls to limit land use of the Cooperative Sewage Treatment plant and chemical plant to industrial use and to prevent groundwater use in the site vicinity until cleanup goals are met. The required institutional controls have been implemented through overlapping land and groundwater use restrictions. More information about the Institutional Controls can be found in the 2022 Five-Year Review (PDF) (pages 13-15). Top of Page
Emergency Response and Removal
Cleanup included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. The immediate threats addressed included a methyl mercaptan storage tank, an estimated 10,000 drums of hazardous materials, 300 tanks and reactor vessels with associated piping, 200 drums containing sodium metal, and the Cooperative Sewage Treatment (CST) plant. The removal actions included the removal and off-site disposal of a large quantity of hazardous materials and dismantling of the CST plant. Top of Page
