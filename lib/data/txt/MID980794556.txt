### Background

The 6-acre U.S. Aviex site is located near Niles, Michigan. The U.S. Aviex Company produced non-lubricating automotive fluids at the site from the early 1960s until late 1978. On-site tanks stored large quantities of chemicals and pipes carried these chemicals to the processing area. During operations in the 1960s and 1970s, releases of hazardous chemicals contaminated soil and groundwater. Contaminants in the groundwater reached private residential wells. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities, which includes groundwater sampling, will continue.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires ongoing groundwater monitoring and implementation of effective institutional controls.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is conducting a five-year review of the U.S. Aviex Superfund site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This is the fifth review of the site.

More information is available at Niles District Library, 620 East Main St. and on this web page under Site Documents & Data. The review should be completed by November 2019.

The five-year-review is an opportunity for you to tell EPA about site conditions and any concerns you have. Contact the community involvement coordinator or remedial project manager.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Governmental institutional controls (ICs) are in place, such as municipal zoning ordinances to prevent the installation and/or use of private wells. In October 2011, the state of Michigan, as the site owner, placed a restrictive covenant and easement on the property prior to transferring the property for reuse. Among other things, the covenant prohibits groundwater use or well installation on site. The covenant also prohibits residential use of the property and excavation of the soil at certain depths.

### Sampling and Monitoring

In 2012, the Michgan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) changed the groundwater monitoring plan to increase the monitoring frequency from annual to semi-annual. It also tests for additional parameters to evaluate whether MNA is working and will be a viable long-term remedy.

In October 2014, MDEQ collected soil gas samples to characterize the soil gas contamination at the property and to evaluate vapor intrusion (VI) risks at the Site. The results suggest that VI is not affecting downgradient residences.
