### Background

The 7-acre Keefe Environmental Services (KES) site is located in Rockingham County, New Hampshire. A chemical waste storage facility operated on-site from 1978 until 1981, when the company filed for bankruptcy. Waste storage containers on-site at that time included 4,100 drums, four 5,000-gallon and four 10,000-gallon aboveground storage tanks, and a 400,000-gallon synthetically lined lagoon. Solvents, acids, caustics, heavy metals, paint sludges, waste oils, and organic chemicals were disposed of at the site. Facility operations led to soil and groundwater contamination on and off the site.

The site is located in a state-protected watershed with wetland areas draining to the Piscassic and Fresh Rivers. Following the construction of the site’s remedy, groundwater extraction and treatment operated from 1993 through 2011 and environmental monitoring is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions. Construction of all remedies has been completed at the site.

Following the state's involvement to secure the site, the EPA initiated further actions to drain the lagoon contents and remove nearby contaminated soils. EPA installed an extraction and treatment system which operated from 1993 through 2011 which was optimized to advanced oxidation in 2005 specifically to address 1,4 dioxane. Prior to site transfer to the state for long-term operations and maintenance, contaminated soils that had been placed in the lagoon were removed and the percolation and liner system was dismantled. The Town of Epping is the current owner of the property.

The potential for direct contact with contaminated soil has been eliminated, and groundwater contaminant concentrations were drastically reduced by years of extraction and treatment. Many years of data collected from nearby residential bedrock water supply wells indicate no site impacts have occurred, as expected given the natural flow of groundwater towards the Piscassic and Fresh Rivers.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s [long-term cleanup](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/41296) included groundwater extraction and treatment using air stripping and carbon adsorption, and later (2005-2011) advanced oxidation. Additional treatment of the soils, using soil vapor extraction, was not needed after additional soil sampling indicated lower concentrations than had been expected.

The EPA [updated the remedy](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/232796) in 2005 to remove the lagoon component (recirculation over the lagoon soils) and changed the groundwater treatment technology from air stripping to a HiPOx system that uses ozone and hydrogen peroxide to reduce contaminant concentrations of 1,4 dioxane. The new HiPOx system began operating in 2005, with a two-year shutdown/rebound study between 2007 and 2009. In 2009, the extraction system was modified and the HiPOx system was placed back into continuous operation through December 2011. The system was shut down again at the end of 2011 to perform a five-year rebound study. At the time of the 2011 shutdown, concentrations in the influent and effluent met groundwater cleanup goals.

In June 2005, EPA transferred full responsibility for the remainder of the cleanup of the site to the State of New Hampshire. The activities undertaken to complete this transfer included the removal of the leaching system and contaminated soils from the former lagoon area, demolition and disposal of the former drum storage and decontamination pad areas, and the restoration of wetlands abutting the site.

Active groundwater treatment was terminated after 18-years of operation and environmental monitoring of the residual contaminants in groundwater are ongoing, including for PFAS, which has been recently detected in groundwater within the Site. The EPA issued a [Record of Decision](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/622393) (ROD) Amendment in 2017 for Operable Unit 2 (OU2) altering the the groundwater remedy. The restoration of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including 1,4-dioxane in groundwater is progressing as expected under monitored natural attenuation (MNA) and concentrations continue to decrease.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**  
  
This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict the use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used appropriately and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.  
  
The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment, and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits, and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left on site and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure), and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remain on site (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1981, when site operations ceased, EPA declared an emergency after determining that the waste lagoon was about to overflow. Emergency actions included drawing down the lagoon to lessen the threat of a spill. In continuing emergency response actions in 1983 and 1984, EPA and the state removed more than 4,000 drums, four 5,000-gallon aboveground tanks, and four 10,000-gallon aboveground tanks of hazardous waste. Lagoon cleanup also included removing the contents of the lagoon and the lagoon liner, and removing highly contaminated soil next to the lagoon for disposal at a regulated facility. These activities finished in 1984.
