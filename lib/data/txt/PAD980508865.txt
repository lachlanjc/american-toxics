### Background

The Presque Isle site is located on the Presque Isle State Park peninsula in Erie County, Pennsylvania. In the early 1970s, the Erie County Health Department noted a noxious black liquid near Beach No.7 on Presque Isle. The discharge released hydrogen sulfide into the air and hazardous substances into the soil and groundwater. The source of the discharge was found to be an unplugged natural gas well that had been dug in 1910 and was abandoned in 1920. Eleven residential wells in the area were sampled in 1982 and were found to be uncontaminated. Presque Isle is a public recreational area used for picnicking, swimming, and fishing. The site was placed on the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983 due to the possibility for releases from other improperly plugged oil and gas wells in the surrounding area. Following investigations by EPA and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the site was deleted from the NPL in February 1989.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

There are no physical hazards associated with the site. In 1982, the well was plugged by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) with cement down to 900 feet, sealing the Bass Island formation. The site was placed on the National Priorities List in 1983 because of the possibility for releases from other improperly plugged oil and gas wells in the surrounding area. An inspection in 1987 detected no odors nor any evidence of discolored sand or of stressed vegetation. No discharge has been observed since 1982. Investigations by the EPA and PADEP found no contamination in the air, surface water, groundwater or soil. EPA and PADEP determined that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment and that any threat to the public was eliminated when the well was plugged in 1982.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) have determined that the Presque Isle site currently poses no threat to the public or the environment and the site was deleted from the National Priorities List in 1989.

EPA conducted a five-year review of the siteâ€™s remedy in 1993. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. The [1993 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2053754) concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. No further five-year reviews will be completed for this site.
