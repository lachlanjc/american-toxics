### Background

The Liquid Gold Oil Corp. site is located in Richmond, California. The 18-acre area is part of a 29-acre property owned by Southern Pacific Transportation (SPT). SPT leased the area to Liquid Gold Oil Corporation, a waste oil storage and transfer facility, until operations ceased in 1982. Facility operations contaminated soils and groundwater with metals and petroleum hydrocarbons. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1996.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. The California Department of Toxic Substances Control has the lead for maintaining the remedy. EPA conducted Five-Year Reviews in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 that concluded that the site’s remedy remains protective of human health and the environment. The next Five-Year Review will be completed in 2025.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Site cleanup finished in 1995. Remaining contaminated soils have been covered with a vegetated cap, the site is fenced and a deed restriction prohibits residential and other uses.

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1996.
