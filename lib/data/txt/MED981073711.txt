### Background

The Eastern Surplus Superfund Site is located in Meddybemps, Maine and consists of approximately 5 acres of land north of Route 191 and another 3 acres of land south of Route 191. The Site is bounded by Meddybemps Lake to the north, by the Dennys River to the east, and undeveloped land to the south and west.

From 1946 to the early 1980s, the Eastern Surplus Company, a retailer of army surplus and salvage items, operated on the portion of site north of Route 191. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous substances. In 1985 the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MEDEP) performed an inspection that identified the site as an uncontrolled hazardous substance site and initiated a removal action to stabilize the site. At the request of MEDEP, EPA assumed control of the removal activities in 1986. Most of the hazardous waste stored in above-ground containers were removed during the first EPA removal action.

EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List (NPL) in June 1996 and began a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) the same year. Between 1998 and1999, EPA performed a non-time-critical removal action (NTCRA) that, among other things, excavated and disposed of contaminated soils and sediment at an approved off-site facility. Site investigations identified two distinct contaminated groundwater plumes. The "northern plume" is situated north of Route 191. The "southern plume" extended beyond the “surficial site” boundary across Route 191. In September 2000, EPA selected a remedy for the stie which was memorialized in a Record of Decison (ROD) for the site. The selected remedy included groundwater extraction and treatment of both plumes, land use restrictions, long-term monitoring, archaeological mitigation activities, and review of the site remedy every five years.

The groundwater extraction system for the southern plume was shut down in 2010 and then decommissioned in 2013-2014 as performance standards had been met and maintained. The groundwater extraction system for the northern plume was suspended in 2011 to allow for an enhanced in-situ bioremediation (EISB) pilot study. Today, treatment via EISB and associated performance monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

MEDEP inspected the site in 1984. MEDEP noted chemical odors, leaking electrical transformers, hundreds of deteriorating drums and containers, compressed gas cylinders, 16,000 pounds of calcium carbide, and numerous areas of stained soil. In 1995, MEDEP started emergency cleanup and removal measures and erected a fence to secure the site property. At the request of MEDEP, EPA assumed control of the removal activities in 1986.

Between 1998 and1999, EPA performed a non-time-critical removal action (NTCRA) that included excavation and disposal of contaminated soils and sediment to an approved off-site facility. The NTCRA also included construction of a groundwater extraction and treatment system for the northern and southern plumes. The groundwater extraction and treatment system was constructed in 2000 and subsequently upgraded in 2001 as prescribed by the Record of Decision (ROD). After groundwater extraction and treatment started, EPA completed three in-ground applications of permanganate to accelerate groundwater cleanup. Contaminant concentrations in the groundwater were successfully lowered on the part of the site south of Route 191.

In September 2000, EPA issued a ROD for the site. The ROD set forth the selected remedy that included groundwater extraction and treatment of both plumes, land use restrictions, long-term monitoring, archaeological mitigation activities, and review of the site remedy every five years. The groundwater extraction system for the southern plume was shut down in 2010 and then decommissioned in 2013-2014 as performance standards had been met and maintained. The groundwater extraction system for the northern plume was suspended in 2011 to allow for an enhanced in-situ bioremediation (EISB) pilot study. Sampling in support of the pilot study indicated significant dechlorination of the primary site contaminants (i.e., tetrachloroethene \[PCE\] and trichloroethene \[TCE\]). Following success of a bench-scale test, EPA performed a large-scale EISB pilot test in 2012 and 2013. EPA selected full-scale implementation of EISB as a component of the remedy in the 2017 Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD).

EPA performed the remedial design for EISB between June 2017 and September 2018. Remedial design activities included a multimedia sampling event, installation of nine bedrock wells, and EISB treatment system design. Phase I of the EISB remedial action began in December 2018, with performance monitoring in March 2019. Phase II EISB treatment began in August 2019 and performance monitoring was completed in December 2019.

EPA finalized a contract for the continued execution of the EISB remedy in September 2021. Pre-injection monitoring occurred in November 2021 and the Phase III EISB treatment was completed, following well rehabilitation activities to address biofouling, in October 2022. Rehabilitation of the wells were not successful to continue Phase IV EISB treatment. In the Fall of 2024 new injection wells were installed and injections will continue in 2025.

EPA has conducted several [five-year reviews](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0101054&doc=Y&colid=32776&region=01&type=SC) of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place continue to protect human health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Ownership of the northern site properties by MEDEP prevents exposure to site groundwater and [institutional controls](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.redevelop&id=0101054#Limits) have been put in place to be protective in the long term.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The results of groundwater sampling following the pilot-scale bioremediation indicated that the bioremediation was successful in reducing contaminant concentrations. Consequently, in 2016 EPA issued a FINAL [EXPLANATION OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES (ESD)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/622817) (21 pp, 7.8 MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) modifying the remedy selected in the 2000 [RECORD OF DECISION (ROD)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/8454) (161 pp, 9.4 MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) to implement a source control full-scale bioremediation effort. The design for the full-scale effort was completed in September 2018 and mobilization for the full-scale implementation occurred in December 2018. Three treatment events, consisting of groundwater extraction, immediately followed by batching (i.e., mixing with various chemicals and amendments) and re-injection, with a subsequent performance monitoring event, were completed in 2018 and 2022. The EISB remedy is anticipated to continue for several years. Further evaluations to address biofouling within the northern plume concluded in 2023 resulting in the decision to install new designated injection wells. After the installation of new injection wells in the fall of 2024, injections will continue throughout 2025. At least two phases of treatment/monitoring events are currently planned.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**  
  
This site requires Institutional Controls (ICs) because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict the use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits, and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left on site and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remain on site (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.

The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment, and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above.

On July 28, 2017, and August 2, 2017, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MEDEP) recorded deed restrictions on the two properties that comprise the portion of the site north of Route 191. Among other things, the deed restrictions (1) prohibit unauthorized excavation, site development, or any other ground disturbance; (2) prohibit the unauthorized extraction of groundwater; (3) prohibit the destruction, obstruction, tampering, or disruption of wells; (4) prohibits a junkyard or automotive graveyard as defined by Maine law; (5) requires a sub-slab vapor barrier and ventilation system or a sub-slab depressurization system for any constructed buildings, and (6) provides for access.
