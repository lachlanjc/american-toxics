### Background

The Fulton Avenue site is located at 150 Fulton Avenue in Garden City Park in Nassau County, New York.  
A fabric-cutting mill operated at the 0.8-acre area from 1965 through 1974. The mill’s operations contaminated soil and water with hazardous chemicals.

This site is being addressed through two phases, or Operable Units (OUs). The first OU (OU1) adresses contaminated groundwater emanating from the 150 Fulton Avenue property. OU1 is being cleaned up under a 2015 Record of Decision Amendment and is currently underway.

The second OU (OU2) adresses a larger groundwater contamination concern which was discovered during the investigation of OU1. The investigation of this portion of the site is temporaily on hold until a new contractor is chosen in 2021/2022..

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through two phases, or operable units (OUs). OU1 addresses the source area, the former location of a cutting mill and dry cleaning facility at 150 Fulton Avenue, and the resultant groundwater plume. OU2 addresses groundwater contamination that is not related to the OU1 source area.

An Interim Remedial Measure (IRM) operated at the site from October 1998 until November 2001. As part of this action, contaminated sediment and soil were removed from the base of the drywell and an air sparging/soil vapor extraction (AS/SVE) system operated until soil gas and indoor air contaminant readings met New York State air requirements. In early 2004, a sub-slab ventilation system was installed to remove soil-gas from under the building at 150 Fulton Avenue as a further protective measure. The Remedial Design of the systems has begun and pre-design field activities have been conducted..

The AS/SVE system (IRM) has met its cleanup goals and has been dismantled. Soil gas and indoor air samples have shown the system to have been fully effective. Over 10,000 pounds (approximately 465 gallons) of PCE were removed by the system. A sub-slab ventilation system was installed during Spring 2004 to assure protectiveness at the site. The actions taken at the 150 Fulton Avenue property have been shown to reduce the indoor air contaminant concentrations to levels below applicable standards. The OU1 Record of Decision was issued in September 2007 which selected the remedy to clean the PCE-dominant portion of the site. The remedy will perform further source remediation by means of In-situ Chemical Oxidation, installation of a groundwater extraction and treatment system to remediate the PCE-dominant portion of the contaminated aquifer, and to provide a well-head treatment system to protect the affected public supply wells. These remedial systems are currently being designed. The field work for Fulton Avenue OU2 began in Spring 2011. This work is being done in accordance with EPA's TRIAD initiative which conducts an investigation in a phased approach. The second phase of work to identify and remediate the source(s) of the observed TCE-dominant portion of the contamination plume started in early spring 2013. The Garden City Water District (GCWD) is presently managing the site contamination which is migrating into the GCWD wells. An Amendment to the OU1 ROD (RODA) was signed in September 2015 which assures that the OU1 portion of the plume continues to not threaten human health and the environment. A Consent Judgement was signed in September 2016 whereby a PRP has agreed to perform the remedial activities described in the OU1 RODA.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

This site is being addressed through Federal, State and Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) actions.

OU1 is being addressed in two stages. The first stage was an interim remedial measure (IRM) focused on cleanup of on-site soil and nearby groundwater. This stage has been completed. The second stage is a long-term effort, which includes further source control by pumping and treatment of groundwater from two production wells of the GCWD to contain the tetrachlorethene (PCE)-dominant portion of the contamination plume in the local aquifer. OU2 addresses the trichlorethelene (TCE)-dominant portion of the contaminant plume.

Previous Actions: From October 1998 until November 2001, the site’s IRM removed contaminated sediments and soils from the base of a dry well and an air sparging and soil vapor extraction (AS/SVE) system operated until soil gas and indoor air contaminant readings met state air requirements. In early 2004, a subslab ventilation system was put in to remove soil-gas from under the building at 150 Fulton Avenue as a further protective measure. The AS/SVE system met its cleanup goals and has been dismantled. Soil gas and indoor air samples indicate the system has been fully effective. The system removed over 10,000 pounds (about 465 gallons) of PCE. The site’s potentially responsible parties (PRP) conducted the IRM.

Contaminated Groundwater: EPA selected the remedy for the PCE-dominant portion of the contaminant plume in the site’s September 2007 Record of Decision, or ROD. An Amendment to the OU1 ROD (RODA) was signed in September 2015.

The Village of Garden City and the PRPs petitioned EPA to amend the ROD to not install the groundwater extraction system and allow the PRPs to fund the well-head treatment at the public supply wells which were containing the OU1 portion of the site plume. EPA reevaluated the remedial system and issued an Amendment to the ROD (RODA) in September 2016. The modified remedy described in the 2016 descibed that the final remedy for OU1 will be determined in the ongoing OU2 ROD.

The Interim Remedial Action for OU1 included a new multi-level monitoring well in the Garden City Country Club (GCCC) and one additional monitoring well upgradient of the GCCC. Those were completed in August 2017 and a sampling program has been ongoing since then.

The Remedial Investigation (RI) of OU2 was under internal review until samplig was restarted July 2019. Two rounds of groundwater sampling were done and the anaysis of the Compound Specific Isotope Analysis was to be completed by EPA personnel in EPA's Edison NJ laboratory. The OU2 RI to date was compiled into a Technical Memeorandum because EPA's RACS consultant's contract came to closure. Presently, EPA is rebidding the contract to complete the RI and Feasibility Study which will lead to a Record of Decision for both Operable Units in the future.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The Fulton Ave. OU1 Remeial Action Sampling has been performed according to schedule and no additional concerns have been observed from the sampling data.

The Fulton Ave. OU2 Remedial Investigation has restarted and the first area-wide sampling event occurred in July 2019. The next round of sampling was done in December 2019.

Currently, EPA is seeking a new contractor to complete this effort for both Operable Units.

### Enforcement Information

There are currently two Resposible Parties named for OU1 and none named for OU2.
