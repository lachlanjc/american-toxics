### Background

The Sauer Dump Superfund Site is located in Dundalk, Baltimore County, Maryland on a partially wooded lot, including wetlands and shoreline along the Back River. The property was an unpermitted facility used as a salvage yard, a dump and a landfill. The improper storage and disposal of hazardous substances contaminated soil and sediment. EPA added the site on the Superfund program's National Priorities List in March 2012.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

The PRP group began a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) in Fall 2013 with EPA oversight. The RI will address data gaps from earlier investigations and determine the extent of contamination on and off site. The FS will then evaluate the cleanup alternatives available to address the contamination that presents an unacceptable risk to human health and the environment.

A removal action was completed in 2017 on several site properties to remove soil contaminated with lead and poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that exceeded EPAâ€™s screening levels.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The Remedial Investigation (RI) was approved in May 2020 and the Feasibility Study (FS) was conducted by the potentially responsible party group with EPA oversight. The RI determined the extent of contamination which extends into the residential properties through soil, sediment, groundwater, and surface water sampling at the dump surrounding properties. The FS evaluated the cleanup alternatives available to address the contamination that presents an unacceptable risk to human health and the environment. Contaminants of concern include lead and poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in soil and sediment.

EPA released a [Proposed Remedial Action Plan](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2356247) for public comment in September 2023.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions in 2005 included placement of a fence around the site to restrict access, installation of a temporary cover system over contaminated areas to mitigate erosion of surface soil, and protection of the shoreline from erosion.
