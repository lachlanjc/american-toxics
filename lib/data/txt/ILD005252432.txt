### Background

The 6-acre Parsons Casket Hardware Co. site is located in Belvidere, Illinois. The company made decorative metal fittings for caskets on site from the early 1900s until 1982. Facility operations included the use of hazardous chemicals. Poor storage practices and spills led to soil and groundwater contamination.

In 1982, Illinois EPA found 120 drums of hazardous waste stored inside and outside the factory. Many were dented, corroded, leaking or uncovered. Above and underground tanks contained about 4,800 gallons of waste. An unlined lagoon contained about 166,500 gallons of liquid waste and 1,230 cubic yards of sludge.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Although Illinois EPA removed the waste in 1985, sampling results indicated that groundwater under the site was contaminated with volatile organic compounds. While the former factory covers only 6 acres, the groundwater, which was contaminated with nickel, manganese and cyanide, covers at least 75 acres. The nearby Kishwaukee River was not affected by the site.

Illinois EPA finished a soil cleanup in 2002. This included excavating and disposing of contaminated soil and sludge, removing dry wells used for disposal, monitoring groundwater, and controlling site access. Since then, EPA has monitored groundwater and conducted a study to determine if there is any residual contamination at the former factory.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the Parsons Casket Hardware Co. Superfund site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. The last review report, completed in May 2022, is available at the following link:

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is designing the groundwater cleanup which was selected in 2005. It will involve treating the contaminated groundwater by injecting material to enhance degradation of contaminants.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
