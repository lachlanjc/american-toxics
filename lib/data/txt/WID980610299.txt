### Background

The 10-acre Tomah Armory site is in the northeastern section of the city of Tomah, Monroe County, Wisconsin. The city of Tomah operated an open, unlined landfill accepting municipal, industrial and construction wastes from the late 1940s and early 1950s to around 1955. The city sold part of the site to the Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs for construction of the Wisconsin National Guard Armory. Prior to the sale, a portion of the landfill was excavated and disposed of off-site. Additional areas were excavated after the sale, including an area west of Woodard Avenue, a portion of the former telephone museum property, and an area where the armory building was expanded. Landfilling operations contaminated soil and groundwater with lead.The 10-acre Tomah Armory site is in the northeastern section of the city of Tomah, Monroe County, Wisconsin.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The soil and groundwater cleanup consisted of monitoring groundwater, leaving waste material in place under the existing soil cover and buildings, and limiting the use of the landfill property and groundwater. Following cleanup, land-use controls, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring were implemented and are ongoing.The soil and groundwater cleanup consisted of monitoring groundwater, leaving waste material in place under the existing soil cover and buildings, and limiting the use of the landfill property and groundwater.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is conducting the fifth five-year review of the site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.
