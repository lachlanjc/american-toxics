### Background

The Letterkenny Army Depot (PDO Area) site is located five miles north of Chambersburg in Franklin County, Pennsylvania. The U.S. Army established the 19,243-acre facility in 1942 for ammunition storage. In 1947, facility activities expanded to include the testing, maintenance and overhaul of vehicles and missiles; the storage and transportation of industrial chemicals and petroleum; and storage, maintenance, demilitarization and modification of ammunition. There are two Superfund program National Priorities List (NPL) sites associated with the Letterkenny Army Depot: the Property Disposal Office (PDO) site and the Southeast (SE) Area site. This narrative addresses the PDO Area site. The PDO Area site was added to the National Priorities List on March 22, 1989. The PDO Area includes areas associated with the storage and disposal of industrial chemicals and petroleum. Historical operations contaminated soil, groundwater, sediment and surface water with hazardous chemicals. Cleanups are complete at some areas within the PDO Area. Operation and maintenance activities at these areas are ongoing. Investigations and remedy selection activities are ongoing at remaining areas.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions. A February 1989 Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) between EPA, the Army and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection identified areas of the site for investigation and possible cleanup. The FFA provided the framework and a schedule to accomplish this work.

The PDO Area has nine investigated areas, known as operable units (OUs). CERCLA work has concluded at OUs 1, 3, and 7.

**PDO OU-1 Source Area Soils**: Investigations in the early 1980s concluded that while OU-1 Source Area Soils were the major source of volatile organic compound groundwater contamination, the soils were no longer an active source of contamination. EPA signed a "No Action" Record of Decision (ROD) in August 1991. However, in 1995, soil contamination was discovered during backfilling on part of the site. PDO OU-4 was created to manage the newly discovered contamination.

**PDO OU-3 Mercury Detections in Rocky Spring Lake**: A site inspection was conducted from April to October 1993 to determine whether there were chronic or unacceptable levels of mercury in the Rocky Spring surface water. The site inspection concluded that the mercury levels are low and comparable to mercury levels in other Pennsylvania lakes.

**PDO OU-7 Southern Martinsburg Shale Region (SMSR)**: The Southern Martinsburg Shale Region (SMSR) is a part of Letterkenny that contains an area of shale bedrock surrounded by downgradient limestone bedrock. This shale bedrock area forms the "highland" or elevated ridge areas in the Phase III parcels. Groundwater sampling in 1999, 2000 and 2002 proved that the SMSR was not impacted by any previous industrial activities at Letterkenny. Based on the finding of “no volatile organic compounds (VOC)-impacted groundwater,” the SMSR was redefined as PDO OU-7 and subsequently became the basis for the Phase III property transfer. EPA signed the ROD in August 2003 with a remedy of no further action. The Army transferred these parcels without any restrictions.This ROD also contained SE OU 14.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

There is currently 1 OU under investigation which may require a remedy at the site.

The Army has the lead role for cleaning up Letterkenny Army Depot (PDO).

Per the Federal Facilities Agreement between EPA, PADEP and the Army, quarterly progress reports are issued with activities at each operable unit and area of concern. For detailed information on the current cleanup status, please contact Levi Thurman (levi.c.thurman.civ@army.mil / 717-267-9836) for the most recent progress report.

CERCLA work is underway at OUs 2,4,5,6,8, and AA.

**PDO OU-2 Lower PDO Area Groundwater and Surface Water**: PDO OU-2 consists of volatile organic compounds (VOC)-contaminated groundwater in the Lower PDO Area. Lower PDO groundwater becomes surface water at the Rocky Spring. Only two chemicals are currently present above risk-based values. The Army finished the remedial investigation and feasibility study for PDO OU-2. The Record of Decision (ROD) was issued in 2014 and included Monitored Natural Attenuation of groundwater and surface water and land use controls.

**PDO OU-4 Oil Burn Pit and Upper PDO Groundwater**: PDO OU-4 addresses soil, sediment and groundwater contamination discovered at the Oil Burn Pit (OBP) (formerly part of OU-1), as well as the groundwater of the surrounding upper PDO area. In 1995, Letterkenny was backfilling the OBP when black, sludge-like material was seen oozing from beneath the fill material. Sludge and soil were found to be contaminated with VOCs. The Army started in-place chemical oxidation as an interim removal action in 1997 that finished in 1999. Soil sampling results indicate that while the interim action achieved a significant reduction in VOCs, removal action goals were not achieved. The Army finished the remedial investigation and feasibility study for PDO OU-4. A Record of Decision was issued in April 2019 for Land Use Controls with Technical Impracticability (TI) Waiver and Alternative Remedial Strategy of Thermal Electrical Resistance Heating (ERH) for groundwater. Land use controls also will apply to soil at the OBP, surface water in Meghan-McKenzie Run (MMR).

**PDO OU-5 DRMO Scrap Yard and PCB Investigation of the Rocky Spring System**: PDO OU-5 encompasses the Rocky Spring Drainage Area. Contaminants of concern include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides. Short-term cleanups included a fishing ban at Rocky Spring Lake in 1995, a time-critical removal action in 1999 to remove 10,660 tons of PCB-contaminated soil and a removal action to remove an additional 42 tons of PCB-contaminated sediment in 2002. The Army finished the remedial investigation and feasibility study for PDO OU-5. A ROD was issued July 2014 for monitored natural recovery (MNR) and LUCs. Reduction of PCB concentrations in sediment and fish will be achieved with MNR with the following components: Restrict land use within the DRMO/Plunge Pool region to C/I use; Prevent disturbance of sediments in the Rocky Spring Branch from the springhouse to the lake and in Rocky Spring Lake by prohibiting wading and swimming; Prevent consumption of PCB-contaminated fish by restricting fishing activities to catch-and-release only until PCB concentrations in fish tissue meet remediation goals; and Restrict access to Rocky Spring Lake to Army-approved recreational visitors.

**PDO OU-6 BRAC Sites:** PDO OU-6 encompasses soil, sediment, and surface water related to multiple BRAC sites. Two RODs have been signed relating to parts of this OU, one in June 2014 and one in April 2019. The June 2014 ROD implements LUCs at all locations related to this ROD, and Environmental Controls at the Pad 5 Landfill and Fagan’s Quarry. The April 2019 ROD for soil at the VESA ensures that land use is restricted to commercial/industrial only to prevent risks from contaminated soils under unlimited use and unrestricted exposure scenarios.

**PDO OU-8 Army Retained Waste Sites:** PDO OU-8 encompasses the soil, sediment, and surface water related to Army retained waste sites. The April 2019 ROD implements LUCs at all sites associated with PDO OU-8, and engineering controls at the Open Trench Landfill.

**PDO OU-AA Ammunition Area:** PDO OU-AA encompasses the soil, sediment, surface water, and groundwater related to two areas within the Ammunition Area. A ROD signed in 2012 institutes LUCs restricting the site to commercial/industrial use, and prohibiting the use of surface water for potable purposes. This ROD also includes SE OU12.

The Army, with EPA concurrence, has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review was conducted in March 2022. EPA issued an Independent Determination Letter to this review in [2024](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2408609). The next Five-Year Review is scheduled for March 2027.
