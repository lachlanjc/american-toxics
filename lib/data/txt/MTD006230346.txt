### Background

Cleanup at the East Helena Superfund Site has largely addressed contamination from a century of smelting by ASARCO. Contaminant concentrations in groundwater have dropped. The contamination plume is shrinking. Stormwater is shed clean off an 80-acre evapotranspirative cover. An evapotranspirative cover, or ET cover, is a highly engineered cap designed to prevent rain and snowmelt from seeping into the groundwater. Prickly Pear Creek flows through a reconstructed, natural channel around 175 acres of new wetlands and floodplain. The 14-million-ton slag pile will be graded and capped in the coming years. This will remove the last major source of groundwater contamination.

The site is in East Helena, Lewis and Clark County, Montana. It consists of a former lead smelter that operated from 1888 until 2001 and thousands of acres of contaminated farmland that is currently being redeveloped. The Superfund area includes the site, the City of East Helena, and surrounding residential subdivisions and agricultural lands. More than 100 years of lead and zinc smelting deposited lead and arsenic in soil in the East Helena Superfund Site. Lead and arsenic that came out of the smelter stacks fell into yards and contaminated the soil. Since the smelter stopped operations in 2001, no new contamination of lead and arsenic is occurring in the East Helena Superfund Site.  
  
Historically, contaminant sources included emissions from the smelter stacks and industrial ponds. Smelter spills and discharges to soil also contributed contamination. Contaminants were carried by air, stormwater, and groundwater. Snowmelt and rainwater seeped through contaminated soils on the smelter, carrying arsenic and selenium into groundwater. Stormwater that came in contact with contaminated soil would run off the site. Water from Prickly Pear Creek (PPC) and two manmade lakes raised groundwater levels under the former plant. This caused groundwater to touch contaminated soils, resulting in groundwater plumes of arsenic and selenium migrating off-site. Cleanup at the site is mainly complete, with one major remedial action—grading and capping the 14-million-ton slag pile—to be performed.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

All buildings and structures at the former smelter have been torn down. Contaminated soils and materials have been taken to one of the two on-site Corrective Action Management Units (CAMUs) and covered with an 80-acre protective cover. The CAMUs have protective multilayer covers and contaminated water collection systems to manage the waste materials. The protective cover has been designed to prevent rain and snowmelt from seeping through and pulling contaminants into groundwater. The cover also prevents people and wildlife from reaching contaminated soil.

The two manmade ponds used by ASARCO have been drained. This lowered groundwater elevations and prevented groundwater from flowing through contaminated soils. Prickly Pear Creek near the former smelter site has been restored, reconstructed, and relocated into a new creek channel. 175 acres of new wetlands and floodplain were created. Portions of the slag pile were reshaped to prevent contaminants from falling into Prickly Pear Creek.

As of 2023, contaminated topsoil has been removed from and replaced at:

- 793 residential yards
- 50 commercial properties
- 373 unpaved road aprons
- 75 unpaved alleys
- 14 unpaved roadways
- 11 parks/public areas
- 5 school playgrounds or church properties
- 141 flood channel sections
- 80 flood ditch sections

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Based on the January 2024 [Updated Lead Guidance](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/updated-soil-lead-guidance-cercla-sites-and-rcra-corrective-action-facilities), the EPA is evaluating the risks from lead in soils to sensitive populations. This analysis will include compiling available site data to determine the potential presence and extent of lead-contaminated soils. Lead can pose health risks to sensitive populations, especially children under 7 years old and pregnant or nursing women. The process to implement the Updated Lead Guidance will involve additional planning, data gathering, risk assessment and funding requests. EPA will coordinate with our state partners and request public feedback on our proposed cleanup plans before additional cleanups begin.

While implementing the Updated Lead Guidance may take several years to complete, the EPA and MT DEQ will share information on planned activities and results as they become available. In the meantime, and out of an abundance of caution, if you live near the East Helena Superfund Site, the EPA recommends you have your children tested for lead annually; especially those under 7 and if the soil at your property was not replaced previously. Additionally, you can take some simple actions to limit exposure to potential lead contamination in soils, including:

- Maintaining yards and other soil cover;
- Washing hands, especially children’s, after handling soil, playing outside, and before meals;
- Making sure children eat nutritious meals high in iron and calcium;
- Keeping dust levels down by mopping and damp dusting regularly;
- Regularly changing out furnace filters;
- Keeping kids’ toys and play areas clean;
- Taking shoes off at the door and keeping pets clean;
- Wearing gloves while gardening; and
- Cleaning homegrown produce and peeling root vegetables.

The EPA East Helena Superfund Site team will communicate with residents affected by this guidance about the specific next steps the Agency will take in their community. Residents may also contact the site’s Community Involvement Coordinator with questions or concerns at ( [meter.mackenzie@epa.gov](mailto:meter.mackenzie@epa.gov?subject=East%20Helena) ).

Former Smelter Site and Slag Pile  
  
Cleanup of the former smelter is mostly complete. Concentrations of selenium and arsenic in groundwater continue to go down. People and migratory birds are protected from contaminated soil on the former smelter site. Shrubs, grasses, and trees have been planted along the reconstructed channel for Prickly Pear Creek and nearby wetlands. Fish can travel from the site to Lake Helena. The area is abundant with wildlife. The slag pile will be graded and capped after the slag recycling project is complete.

EPA oversees and approves cleanup of the former ASARCO smelter by the Montana Environmental Trust Group (METG), Trustee of the Montana Environmental Custodial Trust. EPA also works closely with private homeowners, the City of East Helena, and Lewis and Clark County and Jefferson County officials to ensure cleanup efforts continue to protect human health and the environment. METG \[Exit\] is the independent, court-appointed, environmental response trustee appointed in 2009 to clean up the hazardous waste sites once owned by ASARCO in the state of Montana, including the East Helena site, using funds from the ASARCO bankruptcy settlement. METG is also responsible for facilitating the redevelopment and stewardship of the more than 2,000 acres of former ASARCO lands in East Helena.

#### Residential Yards

Lowered the residential lead cleanup level. An Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) was finalized on January 24, 2024. The ESD removed the 1,000 ppm soil-lead action level and lowered the residential cleanup level from 500 ppm to 400 ppm lead. Comments received on the ESD were supportive. At the same time the ESD was finalized, EPA announced the update to the residential lead guidance. The Site Team is scoping out a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) to determine how the new guidance will be implemented at the Site. In February 2024, it was announced the East Helena Site would receive $40 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) funding, in addition to $10 million remaining from the ASARCO settlement, to support the Remedial Action (RA) to clean up yards with soil lead greater than 400 ppm. In September 2024, EPA finalized an Interagency Agreement (IA) with USACE to perform the RA work.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls (ICs) are in place. ICs play an important role in site cleanups because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or water use. For instance, ICs like zoning restrictions prevent land uses such as building homes on land that has not been cleaned up to a residential level.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Soil moving and disposal: local soil regulations have been in place since 2012. A permit is required for moving more than a cubic yard of soil (approximately a pickup truck load). Please reach out to Lewis and Clark County for information about obtaining this free permit.

Preventing contaminated groundwater exposure: in 2013, the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation adopted the [East Valley Controlled Groundwater Area](https://dnrc.mt.gov/Water-Resources/Water-Rights/Basin-Closures-Stream-Depletion-Controlled-Ground-Water-Areas) to prevent installation of new wells in areas where the selenium and arsenic plumes have migrated off the former smelter property

### Sampling and Monitoring

The Montana Environmental Trust Group (METG) conducts [groundwater sampling in the spring and fall (pdf)](https://www.mtenvironmentaltrust.org/newsite/wpinhere/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r21-EH_2020_WRM_Rpt_Final_optimized.pdf) (103pp, 13.7MB) to monitor groundwater quality and make sure the remedy, or cleanup, is working. To date, concentrations of arsenic and selenium in groundwater have decreased and the contaminated plumes are shrinking.

For more information, please read the [corrective action monitoring plan](https://www.mtenvironmentaltrust.org/2021-corrective-action-monitoring-plan/).

### Green Remediation

A portion of the East Helena unfumed slag—a by-product of lead smelting and an ongoing source of selenium leaching to groundwater—has been recycled to recover valuable metals and manufacture cement. EPA is working with METG and other stakeholders to determine the future of this recycling project. The [unfumed slag removal project(pdf) (2pp, 2MB)](https://www.mtenvironmentaltrust.org/newsite/wpinhere/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Unfumed-Slag-Project-Update-v3.pdf) is expected to recycle 2,000,000 tons of slag and save millions in cleanup costs by removing the primary remaining source of contamination to groundwater.

The 80-acre evapotranspirative (ET) cover is another example of Green Remediation concepts that have been incorporated into the final corrective measures at the former smelter. The ET cover provides a clean surface over contaminated soil. Cover materials and vegetation use natural systems to prevent water seeping through and pulling contaminants into groundwater.
