### Background

The 18-acre Joseph Forest Products site is located about one mile northwest of Joseph, Oregon. A wood-treating facility operated at the site from 1974 until 1985. Poor management practices and a fire that destroyed the treatment building and caused a release of wood treatment solution contaminated soil, sludge, surface water and groundwater with heavy metals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1999.

Joseph Forest Products used a water-based chromated copper arsenate preservative in its wood-treating operations. The treatment building and surrounding buildings were destroyed by a fire in 1974. An estimated 200 gallons of concentrated treatment paste and about 3,000 gallons of treatment solution were lost during the fire. It was assumed that firefighting operations during the fire washed the materials into nearby soil.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires implementation and recording of institutional controls regarding subsurface contamination in the drip pad area.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil and debris; demolition of the on-site treatment building; decontamination of the drip pad and treatment equipment; excavation and decontamination of underground storage tanks; removal and disposal of asbestos; implementation of institutional controls and groundwater monitoring for a period of two years. EPA determined that the cleanup would be carried out as a removal action. The removal action took place in 1993.

Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1999.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Five year reviews were completed in 1998, 2003, 2008, 2014, and 2019.

### Emergency Response and Removal

In 1991, another removal action included excavation and off-site disposal of about 1,068 tons of highly contaminated soil adjacent to the treatment building.
