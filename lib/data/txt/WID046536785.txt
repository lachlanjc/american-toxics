Background
The 15-acre Scrap Processing Co., Inc. site is located in Medford, Wisconsin. A salvage yard currently operates on site. From 1955 to 1974 and periodically until 1981, the company cracked lead and acid batteries to reclaim the lead on site. About 400,000 gallons of acid wastes contaminated with heavy metals from the batteries ran from the crushing area along an unlined ditch and into an unlined pond. The pond intermittently overflowed into the Black River, located along one side of the site, contaminating it with heavy metals and acid. A final cleanup plan was selected in 1997 and completed three years later. It included excavating and removing lead-contaminated soil and sediment and draining the unlined pond. By 2002, sampling results showed that the cleanup was working. Immediate threats have been addressed and long- term protectiveness was achieved when site restrictions were fully implemented in 2018. After approximately 36 years of investigation, cleanup and monitoring of Scrap Processing, EPA removed this site from its National Priorities List, or NPL, on September 30. The NPL is a roster of contaminated areas that are eligible for cleanup under EPA’s Superfund program.  Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
A final cleanup plan was selected in 1997 and completed two years later. It included excavating and removing lead-contaminated soil and sediment and draining the unlined pond. By 2002, sampling results showed that the cleanup was working. Immediate threats have been addressed and the cleanup is expected to be protective in the long- term when site restrictions are fully implemented.

What Is the Current Site Status?
After more than 36 years of investigation, cleanup and monitoring of Scrap Processing, EPA removed this site from the its National Priorities List, or NPL. Further information can be found at: Responsiveness Summary(PDF)(2﻿ pp, 224.56 K, About PDF)  Direct Final Rule (PDF) (3﻿pp, 288.32 K, About PDF) Proposed rule (PDF)(2﻿pp, 257.78 K, About PDF) The NPL is a roster of contaminated areas that are eligible for cleanup under EPA’s Superfund program. EPA completed its fourth five-year review(PDF) (59 pp, 14.05MB About PDF) of the Scrap Processing site.  The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This review included an evaluation of background information, cleanup requirements, effectiveness of the cleanup, and maintenance and monitoring efforts.  It also looked at ways to operate more efficiently. The review found the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. The next scheduled review will be in 2024.  More information is available at the Frances L. Simek Memorial Library, 400 N. Main St., Medford, and on this web page under Site Documents & Data.   If you have questions or need further information, contact the community involvement coordinator or remedial project manager.
