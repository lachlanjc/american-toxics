### Background

The GE Wiring Devices site is located in Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico. The General Electric Company (GE) operates a wiring devices plant on this 5-acre area. The site property was originally leased from the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (PRIDCO); the property is now owned by GE. About a half-ton of mercury was discarded, along with 4,000 cubic yards of defective switch parts and plastic scraps, into a half-acre waste area on site, contaminating the site. Short-term cleanups protected human health and the environment. GE then completed the off-site disposal of all mercury-contaminated materials. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in October 2000.

The General Electrical (GE) Company Wiring Devices Site is located in the south central part of the island of Puerto Rico, in Juana Diaz. GE manufactured mercury light switches at this 5-acre site from 1957 until 1969. Approximately 1/2 ton of mercury was discarded, along with 4,000 cubic yards of defective switch parts and plastic scraps, into a 1/2-acre waste area located on the site. A concrete retaining wall and a fence separate the waste area from nearby residences. There are approximately 10,000 people living within 3 miles of the waste area. Groundwater in the area is used as a source of drinking water, with a public supply well located approximately 1,500 feet west of the waste area. Site Responsibility: This site has been addressed through Federal and potentially responsible parties' actions.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Following a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the nature and extent of site contamination and to evaluate remedial alternatives, EPA selected the remedy in the site’s September 1988 Record of Decision, or ROD. The remedy included: (1) treatability studies on the soil and debris and treating the waste materials, water and contaminated on-site surface soil with a process that separates the mercury from soils through leaching and subsequent mercury recovery; (2) disposing of cleaned material in disposal areas on site; (3) additional groundwater and soil investigations; and (4) groundwater and air monitoring to ensure the effectiveness of the cleanup actions.  

GE completed the groundwater study in 1993; it determined that groundwater was not affected by the waste pile. Additional soil sampling near the waste pile and the residential yards finished in August 1993. Treatability studies by the U.S. Bureau of Mines on the hydrometallurgical treatment of the mercury waste were found to be ineffective. GE conducted treatability studies on other processes, including a different hydrometallurgical treatment. The treatability study for the new hydrometallurgical treatment process finished in September 1994 and the design for this process was completed in December 1995. The remedial action started in April 1997. The first phase of the hydrometallurgical treatment, which involved washing and separating various contaminated materials from the waste pile, finished in March 1998.

EPA updated the site remedy in July 1999 to include off-site disposal of treated waste materials. A total of 13,596 tons of waste were disposed of at an appropriate off-site disposal facility. All work finished by January 2000. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in October 2000.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site was addressed through the off-site disposal of mercury-contaminated wastes.  

Immediate Actions: GE put in a storm drain system and a retaining wall in 1982 to control migration of surface mercury contamination toward nearby residential areas.  

The immediate actions described above stopped the potential migration of contaminants from the GE Wiring Devices site to nearby residential areas. GE completed all off-site disposal of mercury contaminated materials to a RCRA Subtitle C Landfill in the mainland USA. A final Close-out report was issued in June 2000 to address all the cleanup for the Site. The Site has been deleted from the NPL.
