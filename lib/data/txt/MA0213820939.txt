### Background

President James Madison established the Materials Technology Laboratory in Watertown, Massachusetts in 1816. The facility was used originally for the storage, cleaning, repair and issuance of small arms. During the mid-1800s, its mission expanded to include ammunition and pyrotechnics production, materials testing and experimentation with paints, lubricants and cartridges, and the manufacture of breech loading steel guns and cartridges for field and siege guns. The mission, staff and facilities continued to expand until after World War II, at which time the facility encompassed 131 acres. In 1968, the Town of Watertown acquired 55 acres of the site property. In 1960, the Army's first material research nuclear reactor was completed at this lab. The reactor was used in molecular and atomic structure research activities until 1970, when it was deactivated. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission decommissioned the research reactor in 1992; it was demolished in 1994.

The site closed under the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1988. Wastes generated by the facility while it was operating have contaminated soil and groundwater at several areas across the site. Most of the site property has been transferred to private ownership, with the Town of Watertown retaining a small parcel and the State of Massachusetts owning another parcel. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in September 2006.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Cleanup of a 36.5-acre parcel of the site finished in 1998. In November 1999, EPA deleted the area from EPA’s National Priorities List of sites needing cleanup. In September 2005, EPA determined no further cleanup was needed for the Charles River portion of the site. In November 2006, EPA took the site off the NPL.

EPA has conducted several [five-year reviews](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0100953&doc=Y&colid=32866) of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place continue to protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

All areas of contamination have been cleaned up. All imminent health risks have been identified and eliminated or controlled by covers maintained by the Army. In addition, while many of the contaminants detected across the site were within acceptable risk standards for industrial use, risks associated with future residential-use scenarios were identified and were the focus of EPA’s cleanup decisions.

EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in September 2006.

Groundwater is contaminated with volatile organic compounds, and the [2016 Five Year Review](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/587401) identified the need to conduct a vapor intrusion evaluation to determine if there is need for a remedy change to ensure protection of human health.

As discussed in the 2021 Five Year Review, the Army completed a Vapor Intrusion Study for potentially impacted areas in 2019 that concluded that there are no risks to human health from soil vapors. However, since tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) impacted soils had been found in soils near Building 311, the decision was made to remove the soils in order to mitigate any possible human exposure risk to surface and subsurface soils in the future, and to prevent the leaching of PCE and TCE to groundwater. From the second half of 2021 through 2022, a Non-Time Critical Removal Action (NTCRA) was conducted in two phases to remove the PCE and TCE-impacted soils located east of Building 311 and north and west of Building 312. In total, approximately 3,200 tons of contaminated soils were removed from the property during the 2021/2022 NTCRA. As a precautionary measure cracks in the foundation were also sealed to prevent vapor intrusion. A post NTCRA vapor intrusion study report is being prepared.

The Watertown Arsenal area, and Charles River Park and Watertown Yacht Club parcels continue to be inspected annually for compliance with Institutional Controls, with maintenance and repairs made as needed. The shoreline was repaired and stabilized at the Charles River Park in 2018, as soils along the Charles River had shown erosion. At the Watertown Yacht Club, a 20-foot long section of the shoreline block wall was repaired in 2019. Other portions of the block wall are currently being monitored for settling/movement.

The next five-year review is due in 2026.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**  
  
This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.  
  
The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Army monitors the institutional controls required by the remedy on an annual basis.
