### Background

The Ellenville Scrap Iron and Metal site is a 24-acre, inactive scrap iron and metal reclamation facility located in the rural Village of Ellenville, Ulster County, New York. Approximately 10 acres of the 24-acre site were used for scrap metal operations. The site is bound to the north by Cape Road and to the south by Good Beer Kill. Historically, the site had a hydraulic bailing machine used for metal cans and other small parts; scrap metal piles, construction and demolition debris, railroad ties, automobile battery casings pile and brush piles. The site is divided into upper and lower portions by an embankment (landfill), approximately forty feet in height, composed of finely shredded waste, scrap brick, concrete, wood and other debris. The embankment runs in a crescent along a northwesterly to southeasterly axis which bisects the site. Operations at the site began in 1950. In 1997, the site was also used as a landfill and used tire dump. From 1987 to 1998, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) inspected the site on numerous occasions and directed the owner to clean up some of the debris conditions. Approximately 4000 people relying on both public and private drinking water supplies live in the area. This site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

About 10 acres of the site were used for scrap metal operations and battery reclamation from 1950 to 1997. In late 1997, the area was used for landfill purposes and as a tire dump before being abandoned. Following site investigations and short-term cleanups called removal actions, the siteâ€™s long-term cleanup plan was put in place to protect human health and the environment. Operation and maintenance activities for the cleanup are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

During November and December 2004, EPA did a short-term cleanup called a removal action that involved the demolition of all on-site buildings and the disposal of waste oil tanks and about 20 drums containing hazardous materials. In addition, residential soil contaminated with lead were removed and disposed of off site. In 2005, EPA performed further removal cleanup actions. Various piles of debris were disposed of and scrap metals were recycled. Abandoned dumpsters, cars, trucks and other heavy equipment were dismantled and either recycled or used as scrap. All contaminated soil were tested and removed.

Also in 2005, EPA began a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the nature and extent of site contamination and to evaluate cleanup alternatives. Activities included a soil gas survey, collecting surface soil samples, installing monitoring wells and collecting groundwater, surface water and various site-related liquids. The site has been cleaned up.

EPA performed the first five-year review for the site in 2017 and issued a report which indicated that the site continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

EPA performed a second five-year review for the site in 2022 and issued a report which indicated that the site continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in two stages: immediate actions and a potential long-term cleanup phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.

**Immediate Actions**: The Village of Ellenville conducted a preliminary debris removal and a large tire removal at the site during the preliminary investigation phase.

**Long-term Cleanup**: In 1995, the site property owners agreed to do a preliminary site assessment and conduct an interim cleanup measure and installed a monitoring well.

EPA selected a final cleanup plan for the site in September 2010. EPA dug up and consolidated contaminated soil on-site. The landfill was securely capped to prevent contaminants from leaching out of the landfill into the groundwater. Monitoring wells were installed, the landfill area fenced off and the landfill cap seeded with new vegetation. The cleanup finished in the fall of 2011. New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) continues to conduct ongoing O&M activities, including groundwater sampling and landfill cap inspection.

The Declaration of Covenants, Restrictions and Environmental Easements Map, Successors-In-Title and Site Management Plan are in place, and the institutional controls will continue to be implemented, according to these documents, maps and surveys.

The landfill cap is intact and continues to operate as designed and installed. Regular NYSDEC site inspections of the landfill cap and surrounding areas show that the cleanup action is complete and continues to function as designed.

The Ellenville site was deleted from the National Priorities List on Septmeber 25, 2019.
