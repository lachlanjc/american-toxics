Background
The Chemical Control Corporation (CCC) site is a 2-acre area next to the Elizabeth River in Elizabeth, New Jersey. From 1970 to 1979, a hazardous waste storage, treatment and disposal facility operated on the site, accepting chemicals including: acids, arsenic, bases, cyanides, flammable solvents, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), compressed gases, biological agents and pesticides. Throughout its operations, CCC was cited for discharge and waste storage violations. The facility was closed by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1979 due to environmental and safety violations Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The United States Environmental Protection Agency performed several interim environmental response actions at the site which significantly reduced the potential for exposure to hazardous materials and eliminated sources of contamination. Construction of the final remedy for the site was completed in December 1993. The final remedy involved the construction of a slurry wall around the site which is anchored into the underlying clay layer.  Approximately 25,000 cubic yards (40,000 tons) of contaminated soil was solidified with cement, within the slurry wall. The solidified soils were later covered with clean gravel and graded. An 8-foot tall chain-linked fence was installed around the site to restrict unauthorized access. Contamination later found in a narrow area along the bank of the Elizabeth River, next to the slurry wall, was bio-remediated.  The bio-remediation reduced, but did not eliminate, all of the contamination in this area. EPA has conducted five-year reviews at the site that evaluate the performance of the remedy to ensure the remedy protects public health and the environment and it is functioning as intended by its design. The most recent review completed on June 28, 2024, concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site is now being used as a staging area for construction material. The current site use does not pose a risk to the integrity of the remedy.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
In November 2017, a deed notice was established for the site soil. The deed notice ensures that human exposure to soil contamination in excess of remediation standards does not occur.  In January of 2018, a Classification Exception Area was established for groundwater beneath and downgradient of the site to ensure that the uses of the affected groundwater are restricted until appropriate standards are achieved.

Sampling and Monitoring
Visual inspections and hydraulic conductivity testing of stored stabilized soil samples/cores have been performed since 2009. Groundwater sampling from three on-site monitoring wells is conducted once every five years.  Top of Page
