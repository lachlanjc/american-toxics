### Background

The Newport Naval Education/Training Center (NETC) Superfund site was used by the Navy as a refueling depot from 1900 to the mid-1970s. The NETC, currently named Naval Station Newport, encompasses 1,063 acres on the west coast of Aquidneck Island in Portsmouth, Middletown, and Newport, RI. The Base also encompasses the northern third of Gould Island in the Town of Jamestown, RI. The site includes multiple areas of contamination, including one landfill, a fire training area, a former shipyard, five tank farms, and varying degrees of groundwater contamination. The U.S. Navy is the lead agency for site investigation and cleanup, with formal oversight by EPA and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM). EPA funded a Technical Assistance Grant to the Eastern Rhode Island Conservation District to provide technical assistance to the community. A federal facility agreement was signed by the Navy, EPA, and RIDEM in March 1992 and it establishes cleanup schedules and enforcement procedures.

An 11-acre portion of the site along the shore of Narragansett Bay, known as McAllister Point Landfill, accepted wastes consisting primarily of domestic refuse, acids, solvents, paint, waste oil, and oil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls from 1955 to the mid-1970s. Five tank farms are located in the Melville area; one is located in Midway. Sludge from nearby tank farms was dumped on the ground or burned in chambers. One tank farm is located 300 feet from a coastal wetland. Other areas of concern include Old Fire Fighting Training Area, Tank Farm 1, Tank Farm 2, Tank Farm 3, Tank Farm 4, Tank Farm 5, Gould Island, Derecktor Shipyard, Carr Point Storage Area, and MRP Site 1 Carr Point Shooting Range. DFSP Melville was added as a new site in 2016. Other contaminated areas on site, such as the Melville North Landfill, are classified as Formerly Used Defense sites, and will be addressed separately. Surface water and groundwater flow toward the bay, which is used for boating and fishing. An estimated 4,800 people obtain drinking water and 220 acres of land are irrigated from private wells located within three miles of the site. Approximately 10,000 people live within three miles of the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

A 1991 investigation revealed elevated levels of petroleum hydrocarbons in soils. This study led to the removal of the contents of Tanks 53 and 56 at Tank Farm 5 supplemented by a short-term groundwater pump and treat system These tanks were closed under the State of Rhode Island's underground storage requirements.

The removal of the contents of Tanks 53 and 56, the construction of a landfill cap over the McAllister Point Landfill, excavation of contaminated soils at Tank Farm 4, the installation of a soil cover at Tank Farm 5, and the installation of a groundwater pump and treat system at the Tank Farm have reduced the potential for exposure to contaminants at NETC while additional cleanup actions are planned. Contaminated sediment and debris have been removed from the area adjacent to the McAllister Point Landfill and the eelgrass has been restored. Contaminated soil and debris were removed from the Old Fire Fighter Training Area in 2005. In 2017, 20,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediment were removed from Derecktor Shipyard. Additional cleanup actions are under consideration for the Carr Point Storage Area and Shooting Range, and final remedies will be selected in 2020.

**McAllister Point Landfill - Operable Unit (OU) 1 and OU4**  
Two separate remedial actions have been implemented at McAllister Point Landfill. First, a Record of Decision was signed in 1993 for the landfill. A stone revetment and a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act subtitle C landfill cap were constructed on the upland portions of the landfill and implemented as part of the source control (OU1) presumptive remedy. The landfill cap minimizes infiltration of rainfall through waste materials and reduces leachate released to the near shore marine environment. The remedy is functioning as intended. Vent gas and ambient air monitoring are ongoing to ensure that emissions are within acceptable parameters. Groundwater is not contaminating the bay and monitoring continues on the western edge of the landfill. Annual reports are submitted by the Navy on the Operations, Maintenance and Monitoring activities.

Landfill debris was discovered in the intertidal area beyond the landfill boundary during construction of the cap. A second Record of Decision was signed in February 2000 for Marine Sediments/Management of Migration (OU4) that required removal of the landfill debris and adjacent contaminated sediments. Dredging was completed in 2001 in the nearshore and offshore areas, and subsequently backfilled and restored. Habitat restoration, including construction of fish habitat structures and off-site eelgrass restoration, were completed in 2006. An Explanation of Significant Differences was signed in 2007 that described Land Use Controls (LUCs) established for the site. The LUCs will be maintained until concentrations of hazardous substances have been reduced to levels that allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure, as determined by the Post-Closure Monitoring and Maintenance plan. The 2014 Five-Year Review concluded that the remedy is functioning as designed.

**Tank Farms - OUs 2, 11, 13, 14, and 15**  
At Tank Farm 5, an investigation into the nature and extent of site contamination was completed in 1992 and an interim cleanup remedy to contain contaminated groundwater was selected in 1992. A groundwater pump and treat system was installed to eliminate the flow of contaminated groundwater to Narragansett Bay. Investigation and cleanup of contaminated soils at Tank Farms 4 and 5 was completed in June 2007. In October 2011, the Navy issued Feasibility Studies for Tank Farms 4 and 5. The Tank Farm 4 remedy was selected in September 2013 and the Tank Farm 5 remedy was selected in January 2014. In accordance with the selected remedies, contaminated soils were excavated from two areas at Tank Farm 4 in 2016 and a clean soil cover was finished at Tank Farm 5 in 2017. Additional cleanup actions are planned at Tank Farms 2 and 3 for contaminated soil. The remedy for Tank Farm 1 was selected in 2016 and cleanup was completed in 2019. Additional investigations are ongoing at all five tank farms to assess the contamination levels in groundwater.  
  
**Old Fire Fighting Training Area - OU3**  
Several removal actions have occurred at OFFTA including soil removal and off-site disposal and replacement of the revetment wall that protects the site from wave action. Three mounds were excavated in the fall of 2004 and the rest of the contaminated soil was excavated in the fall of 2007. Construction of the revetment wall was completed in 2011. The groundwater, soils, and sediments were addressed in a September 2010 ROD. The selected remedy is a soil cover, land use controls, and long-term monitoring for groundwater and sediments. The groundwater boundary for the site was expanded in 2015. Construction was completed in August 2014 and groundwater monitoring is on-going.  
  
**Derecktor Shipyard - OUs 5 and 12**  
The Navy evaluated alternatives to address the contamination in the sediments offshore of the shipyard in several Feasibility Studies (1998, 2004, and 2008 and February 2008). The Navy collected additional sediment samples in the Spring of 2011. Buried deposits of sandblast grit were discovered onshore in December 2004 on the onshore area of the site and were investigated in 2005. A second removal action for sandblast grit was completed in December 2007 as part of an enforcement action. In the Spring of 2012, the Navy took additional samples to evaluate the onshore groundwater and soils. The final remedy for Derecktor Shipyard Offshore (OU5) was selected in September 2014. Construction began in January 2016. The dredging and the cap under Pier 2 were completed in April 2018. The final remedy for Derecktor Shipyard Onshore (OU12) was also selected in September 2014. Construction is ongoing. At least seventeen sinkholes have been identified onshore at Derecktor Shipyard that may interfere with the protectiveness of the remedies. The Navy is currently investigating the potential risk and methods to minimize further soil erosion.

**Gould Island - Former Building 32 - OU6**  
Field work for the remedial investigation at Building 32 on Gould Island (OU6) began in the spring of 2006 to delineate the nature and extent of soil, sediment, and groundwater contamination. In September 2011, the Navy issued a Feasibility Study for the site. The final remedy was selected in June 2014 and amended to expand the area of soil excavation in 2015. Construction began in September 2015. Contaminated soil has been excavated. Sediment dredging ended in Spring 2018 after low yields prevented design depths from being met. Since remedial goals were not met, the Navy is currently evaluating the geophysical conidtions at the site and conisdering options to ensure a protective remedy.

**Coddington Cove Rubble Fill -OU16**  
Site 23 is Coddington Point where buried construction debris and asbestos-containing material has been discovered along the shoreline. Lead-contaminated soil has also been discovered. The groundwater data did not reveal contamination above drinking water standards. A Feasibility Study was completed in 2017. RIDEM is concerned about contamination in the debris and the applicability of solid waste regulations. A removal action for lead-contaminated soil is planned for 2019 and a final remedy for the site is planned for 2020.

**Naval Undersea Warfare Center Disposal Area - OU7**  
The Remedial Investigation was conducted from 2006 to 2011. The Final Feasibility Study was issued in July 2012. The ROD was signed in September 2012 and requires cleanup of soil, sediment, and groundwater. In 2013, the Navy completed pre-design investigations and began the design of the NUSC Disposal Area. On-site construction of the soil component of the remedy has been substantially completed and groundwater and sediment remedies are underway.

**Remaining Site Areas**  
Investigations into the nature and extent of contamination at the remaining site areas including Tank Farms 1, 2 and 3, Carr Point Shooting Range and Storage Area, and DFSP Melville are ongoing.

**Enforcement Highlights**  
This site is being addressed under the Installation Restoration Program, a specially-funded program established by the Department of Defense (DOD) to identify, investigate, and control the migration of hazardous contaminants at military and other DOD facilities.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The cap was completed at the McAllister Point Landfill in 1996. The pump and treat system for the groundwater at Tanks 53 & 56 was shut off in 1998 and is currently under evaluation for a final remedy decision. Dredging offshore of the McAllister Point Landfill was completed in October 2001. Investigations are completed at the Old Fire Fighting Training Area, Naval Undersea Warfare Center Disposal Area, the Derecktor Shipyard, and Gould Island.

Investigations at the Tank Farms began in early 2003 and investigations at the Coddington Cove Rubble Fill Area began in 2010. Proposed remedies were issued for public comment for both the former Carr Point Storage Area and former Carr Point Munitions Response Program Site in October 2018, and February 2019, respectively.. The Five Year Reviews completed in December 1999, December 2004, December 2009, and December 2014 confirmed that all remedies implemented continue to protect human health and the environment. Access is restricted at most of the remaining sites where remedies have not been implemented, so potential threats to human health and the environment are minimized.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**  

At this site, activity and use limitations - called institutional controls - are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They can also guide human behavior. For example, zoning restrictions prevent land uses that are not consistent with the level of cleanup (e.g., residential use).

A basewide instruction prohibits the use of the groundwater for drinking water and digging within contaminated areas. Fishing is also prohibited in some sites.

This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions about the ICs for this site.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
