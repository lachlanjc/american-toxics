### Background

The Saco Municipal Landfill site is located in Saco, Maine. The City of Saco has owned and operated a landfill at the site since 1960. The site consists of four distinct disposal areas, the fourth of which is a recently closed landfill that accepted household waste and tannery sludge containing chromium and other heavy metals, as well as volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

In 1975, the Biddeford and Saco Water Co. extended water lines along Jenkins Road and Route 112.

The site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in February 1990.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, municipal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. The selected cleanup plan presented by EPA addressed site risks through a landfill cap that reduced the generation of leachate and promoted groundwater restoration and through continued long-term monitoring of the groundwater and sediments.

The City of Saco, working with ME DEP and EPA, disposed of wastes from Area 3 in mid-1991. These wastes were not hazardous and included leather and rubber scraps from local industry. From 1992 to 1994, EPA studied the groundwater and produced two reports. EPA capped the landfill in September 1996. The landfill cap was completed in late 1998. Institutional controls were finalized in 2000 and added to in 2021 to restrict site uses.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included landfill capping, monitored natural attenuation for the site’s groundwater contamination, and land use restrictions. EPA is working with the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (ME DEP) and the City of Saco to oversee a long-term monitoring program to evaluate the natural attenuation.

Operation and maintenance activities and groundwater monitoring are ongoing.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**  
  
This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.  
  
The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
