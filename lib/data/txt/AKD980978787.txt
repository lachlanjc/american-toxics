### Background

The 6.2-acre Standard Steel and Metals Salvage Yard (USDOT) site is located in an industrial area of Anchorage, Alaska, near the intersection of Railroad Avenue and Yakutat Street. The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) acquired the land in the 1920s. USDOT leased the area to businesses that operated metal recycling and salvaging operations from 1955 until 1993. Recycling and salvage activities handled electrical transformers and batteries resulting in releases of hazardous substances from these activities and inappropriate burial or burning of transformer oil. Cleanup has finished. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2002. Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

The site is adjacent to Ship Creek, a stream used for sport fishing. A recreational trail runs along the southern bank of the creek.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

EPA completed the fourth Five-Year Review of the site’s remedy in 2018. It concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA selected the site’s long-term remedy in 1996. It included recycling/disposal of solid wastes; solidifying some of the soils; building an on-site Toxic Substances Control Act disposal cell to contain contaminated material; maintaining the landfill; conducting operation and maintenance activities; and putting institutional controls in place.

A commercial construction-recycling business operates on the cap of the landfill.

**Cleanup Progress**

The site’s long-term cleanup removed all remaining scrap debris and regulated material stockpiled at the yard to off-site recycling and disposal centers. Contaminated soil and debris were excavated and buried in a regulated on-site landfill protected with more than three feet of layered cover, water drainage and flood protection systems. The old erosion control wall on the bank of Ship Creek was replaced with a natural erosion protection system. This system uses native vegetation and artificial logs to secure the stream bank and provide habitat for wildlife.

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the National Priorities List in 2002.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Groundwater sampling has been discontinued at the site. Groundwater monitoring wells were decommissioned in 2018.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. From 1986 through 1988, EPA removed PCB-contaminated oil, drums of hazardous waste and thousands of pounds of lead-acid batteries.
