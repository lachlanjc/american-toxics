### Background

The 20-acre White Farm Equipment Company Dump site is located along the northern edge of Charles City, Iowa. Starting in the 1920s, the White Farm Equipment Company's operations generated foundry sand, sludges and dust from air pollution control equipment. Between 1971 and 1985, the plant intermittently disposed of foundry sands, baghouse dust and other industrial wastes at the site. About 650,000 cubic yards of these wastes were placed on site. The remedy was completed in 1995 with the completion of a cap of the landfill. The EPA took the site off the National Priorities List in 2000. Groundwater monitoring and site maintenance are the remaining actions being conducted at the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In a Consent Decree in 1991, Allied Products Corporation agreed to perform the remedial design and construct the remedial action. The remedial design and construction of the remedial action were conducted in accordance with the Record of Decision as modified by the Explanation of Significant Differences. The remedial design was approved by the EPA on March 30, 1994.

The remedial action construction activities consisted of installing the compacted cap, vegetating the cap, installing perimeter fencing and instituting deed restrictions. On October 5, 1992, a restrictive covenant for the property was recorded and filed in Floyd County. The restrictive covenant was replaced by an environmental covenant on October 16, 2009. The environmental covenant currently imposes the following activity and use limitations for the property:

- The construction, installation, maintenance and use of any wells on the property for the purpose of extracting water for human drinking purposes or for the irrigation of food or feed crops.
- The soil cap located on the property shall be maintained in good repair in order to prevent direct contact with the landfill materials, reduce infiltration and leaching of contaminants and minimize run-off transport of contaminants.
- The soil cap located on the property shall not be excavated or disturbed except for minor excavations necessary to install, maintain or repair fences unless approved in advance in writing by the EPA or its assigns.
- The fence located on the property shall be maintained in good condition and repair. The hazardous chemical warning signs shall continuously be displayed in a conspicuous place on said fence, and such signs shall be maintained in legible condition.
These restrictions run with the land and are binding on all owners. The remedial action was constructed from mid‑1994 to mid‑1995. Construction completion was achieved when the Site Closeout Report was completed on September 8, 1995. The EPA took the site off the National Priorities List in 2000.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site was addressed through federal and responsible party actions. The responsible party filed for bankruptcy in 2000. The site is now Fund-lead. Groundwater monitoring and site maintenance are the remaining actions being conducted at the site.

The EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review in 2024 concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. Capping the site’s landfill has addressed the threats posed by the site to human health and the environment.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Groundwater monitoring is conducted in conjunction with the Five-Year Review. The last round of groundwater sampling was completed by the EPA in October 2023 along with surface water and sediment sampling in nearby wetlands. The sample results were incorporated into the remedy review in the sixth Five-Year Review report signed in February 2024. The Five-Year Review reports for the site are available on the Site Documents and Data page ( [here](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0700181&doc=Y&colid=38044&region=07&type=SC) ).

The sixth Five-Year Review report had several recommendations related to the groundwater monitoring network for purposes of ongoing Operation & Maintenance (O&M) and supporting future five-year reviews. The planned completion date of the recommendations is September 30, 2033.
