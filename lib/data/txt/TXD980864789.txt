### Background

The Malone Service Company (MSC) site is located in Texas City, Galveston County, Texas, at 5300 Campbell Bayou Road. The Site is on the shores of Swan Lake and west Galveston Bay, approximately 1.6 miles south-east of the intersection of Loop 197 and State Highway 3.

The site is bounded to the northwest and southwest by operating and closed waste management fa-cilities and to the northeast, southeast, and south by Swan Lake and a large expanse of wetlands. The Site is approx-imately 1.5 miles from the nearest residential area. An es-timated 10,000 people live and/or work within a three mile radius of the site.

The MSC operated from 1964 to 1997, and was a reclamation, storage and dispos-al facility for waste oils and chemicals that included acid and caustic compounds, solvents, and crude oil tank bottoms. The MSC site covers approximately 150 acres. Approximately 100 acres of the 150-acre site were developed for the storage, pro-cessing and disposal of industrial hazardous wastes. The developed acreage contained numerous waste handling areas which include storage tanks, 2 API separators, a ±5 acre settling pond (Earthen Impoundment), a closed ±0.5 acre waste collection pond (Oil Pit), and two (2) deep subsurface injection wells

The Record of Decision (ROD) was signed on September 30, 2009; the ROD presents the selected remedy for sludge waste (solidification and placement in onsite Subtitle C cell), contaminated soil (placement in Subtitle C cell) and Class 3 ground water (monitor) at the Site.

The EPA and the Potential Responsible Parties (PRPs) agreed to the Consent Decree (CD) for the implementation of the Remedial Design (RD) and Remedial Action (RA)/cleanup. The PRPs began RD/RA activities in 2013.

The Final RA site inspection was completed on December 13, 2017, which indicated that all RA construction activities were completed as per the approved RA work plans. The Preliminary Closeout Report documents that the Site is construction complete – no further RA activities. A Final RA Report will document that the Site will phase from RA to Operations and Maintenance

EPA oversees the cleanup all work is conducted under EPA and TCEQ approved work plans, including a Site specific Air Monitoring Work Plan (AMP). As part of the AMP, EPA and the Site cleanup contractors were continuously monitoring air quality and collected air samples within the Site and at the Site property perimeter, both upwind and downwind, on a daily basis. None of the air monitoring data indicated levels that are dangerous or that exceed the EPA approved health based action levels at the perimeter.

Some of the material that was cleaned up has an extremely low odor threshold, and with changing wind directions nearby residents may have noticed the odor, which presents no health threat to the community. The cleanup contractors have implemented extensive engineering controls in the field to minimize any odor that could leave the Site.

In response to resident complaints of odor potentially resulting from the cleanup, EPA and the Galveston County Health District did investigate and determined that to the extent the odor is from the Site, the odor presented no health threat to the community. Representatives of the Health District worked cooperatively with EPA and the PRPs to ensure the cleanup work was properly protective of the community and onsite workers.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Remedial Investigation (URS – April 24, 2006), Human Health and Ecological baseline risk assessments (June 2006), and the Feasibility Study (URS – June 2008) were completed. The Proposed Plan of action for site contaminants was presented to the public. The remedial action for site contaminants was presented in the Record of Decision (ROD) for the site. The ROD presents the cleanup measures determined to be protective of human health and the environment. The Remedial Action/cleanup construction activities were completed on December 13, 2017. Human health exposure is under control.

The EPA Region 6 Response and Prevention Branch conducted removal assessment activities at the Site between July and October 1999. Following the removal assessment activities, the EPA Region 6 Response and Prevention Branch conducted an emergency response action in April and May 2000 (Ecology and Environment \[E&E\] 2000). The EPA Remedial Branch began Remedial Investigations (RI) in 2004; the remedy documented in the 2009 ROD was based on the RI and the Feasibility Study (FS). A group of Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs), known as the Malone Cooperating Parties (MCP), funded the Remedial Investigation (RI), the Remedial Design (RD) and the Remedial Action (RA) pursuant to a Consent Decree (the Order, July 2012). The PRPs and EPA completed all RA cleanup activities on December 13, 2017.The EPA Region 6 Response and Prevention Branch conducted removal assessment activities at the Site between July and October 1999.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA Superfund Division Director signed the Record of Decision (ROD) on September 30, 2009; the ROD pre-sents the selected remedy for sludge waste (solidification and placement in on-site Subtitle C cell), contaminated soil (placement in Subtitle C cell) and Class 3 ground water (monitor) at the Site.

The EPA and the Potential Responsible Parties (PRPs) agreed to the Consent Decree (CD) for the implemen-tation of the Remedial Design (RD) and Remedial Action (RA)/cleanup. The PRPs began RD/RA activities in 2013, and completed the cleanup on December 13, 2017 - construction completion. Following construction completion, and approval of The Final RA report (the construction document), the Site will be in the Operation and Maintenance period; whereby, the Site will be inspected each year to document no damage to the Cell and that contaminated ground water remains onsite and is degrading.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The 2009 ROD documents that the future use of this Site will be as a preserve or conservancy. T he Malone Cooperating Parties (MCP) purchased the Site property from the Site owner and has agreed that the Site would be a preserve or that the local Scenic Galveston Conservancy group would have first right of refusal in accepting the property and maintaning it as a preserve. The Site will have several restrictions documented in a Restrictive Covenant, which will follow the land deed.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Historic investigations were conducted by Malone Service Company (MSC) and predecessor agencies of Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). MSC conducted a ground water assessment for the closure of the Earthen Impoundment in May 1982 (Law 1982). Results of the assessment were submitted to the Texas Water Commission (TWC – predecessor TCEQ). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted a preliminary review (PR) of the available site information followed by a visual site inspection (VSI) in August 1988 (Kearney et. al. 1989). The purpose of these activities was to identify releases or potential releases requiring investigation at hazardous waste management facilities. Solid waste management units s and other areas of concern were identified during the inspection. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC – predecessor TCEQ) conducted a Screening Site Inspection (SSI) in January 1997. SSI activities included on-site and off-site reconnaissance, record searches, on-site and off-site sample collection, and interviews with site representatives (TNRCC 1998). The EPA Region 6 Response and Prevention Branch conducted removal assessment activities at the Site in 1999. EPA and the Malone Cooperating Parties (MCP - the Potentially Responsible Parties \[PRPs\]) conducted several investigations from 2004 to 2008. Historic documents were reviewed to develop an understanding of Site operations and Site soils and ground water contamination. The Preliminary Site Characterization Report (PSCR) (URS 2004a) and the Preliminary Remedial Alternatives Evaluation Report (PRAER) (URS 2004b) documents were developed following the review. The MCP began active sampling of the Site in July 2005 through 2007 to define nature and extent of contamination in soils and ground water, and define the risks to human health and ecological receptors. The documents developed in this period were the RI Report (URS 2006a), which determined the nature and extent of contamination; the Baseline Human Health Risk Assessment (BHHRA) Report (URS 2007a); and the Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment (BERA) Report (URS 2007b). The Stabilization/Solidification Treatability Study Report (Shaw 2008) was completed to determine effective reagents, which would solidify the sludge for placement in a RCRA Subtitle C or D cell (landfill). The FS Report (URS 2008) was developed to present potential remedies for ite wastes. There are three minor ground water ontaminant plumes; ground water samples are collected from these plumes every year to document the plume is degrading and stable.

### Green Remediation

Following cleanup, this site will be maintained as a preserve or conservancy. The property immediate to the site is maintained as a nature preserve through a local conservancy. Native grasses have been establised on areas disturbed by operations to support wildlife.

### Emergency Response and Removal

The EPA Region 6 Response and Prevention Branch conducted removal assessment activities at the Site between July and October 1999. Following the removal assessment activities, the EPA Region 6 Response and Prevention Branch conducted an emergency response action in April and May 2000 (Ecology and Environment \[E&E\] 2000).
