### Background

The 40-acre Delilah Road site is located in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey. The 40-acre Delilah Road site is one of a complex of four landfills formerly operated by Mr. Charles Price. The site was a sand and gravel pit used for sand mining operations and was then converted to a solid waste disposal site, accepting municipal and construction wastes and some hazardous wastes. A permit subsequently was issued for the disposal of non-hazardous municipal and solid waste only. The site accepted municipal and household wastes from 1974 to 1980, but records indicate that drummed flammable wastes and sludges containing trichloroethylene and lead were dumped at the site.

A notice of violation was issued by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) in 1979. Landfill operations ended in 1980. Numerous incidents of illegal dumping were reported after the site was closed. Sampling by EPA uncovered groundwater contamination in 1982. Jarrets Run, a creek that flows intermittently into Absecon Creek, is located 1,000 feet north of the landfill. A New Jersey Water Company public water supply well is located near the landfill. Site Responsibility: This site is being addressed through State actions.

Construction of the site’s remedy has been completed. Long-term groundwater monitoring is ongoing. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in October 2009.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The NJDEP conducted numerous site inspections and issued cease and desist orders and levied fines against the operators of the site. After the landfill ceased operations, the State completed the installation of municipal water supply mains in the area near the site. Hookups have been provided to the residences and businesses around the perimeter of the landfill that previously relied on private wells for their water supply. In addition, private wells have been sealed in compliance with State requirements to limit access to contaminated groundwater via these potable wells.  

In the fall of 1994, the State and several potentially responsible parties entered into an Administrative Consent Order (ACO) for remedial activities at the site. The ACO calls for a soil cover and further called for the NJDEP to issue an ESD to modify the State's 1990 ROD. NJDEP issued an ESD in September 1998, which changed in the remedy selected in the ROD from a non-hazardous cap with an impermeable layer to a soil cap.  
All components of the site’s remedy were put in place during the winter of 2001.  

In August 2006, the State determined that no further action was necessary for the remediation of the site. In March 2009, EPA began the deletion process for the site. The NJDEP concurred with the deletion of this site in a letter dated May 21, 2009. The Site was deleted from the NPL on October 13, 2009.  
  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in a single, long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.  

Long-term Cleanup: The State completed a remedial investigation and feasibility study and signed a Record of Decision, or ROD, selecting the site’s remedy in 1990. The ROD included placement of an impermeable layer cap on the landfill; installation of a surface water control system; installation of a landfill gas collection and treatment system, subject to design studies confirming the need for this system; implementation of an air and groundwater monitoring program; and fencing of the site and establishment of appropriate deed restrictions. The State updated the remedy in September 1998, substituting a soil cap for the impermeable cap called for in the ROD.  

EPA removed the site from the NPL in 2009. Long-term groundwater monitoring is ongoing.
