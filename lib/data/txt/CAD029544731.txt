Background
The Del Amo site is located in Los Angeles. Industrial operations on the 280-acre area from 1943 to 1972 produced synthetic rubber, first for the United States government during World War II and later for the Shell Oil Company. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. The site was placed on the National Priorities List in 1997. Today, the site’s long-term cleanup is ongoing. Most of the area has been redeveloped as an industrial park. The site is divided into what EPA calls "operable units" (OUs). Each OU has its own cleanup plan. At Del Amo, there are three OUs. OU-1 addresses soil contamination. Contamination consists of various contaminants including benzene, tetrachloroethene, and trichloroethene. OU-2 is specific to the former waste pits at the site. These pits used to hold waste form the former rubber manufacturing facility. The contamination at OU-2 is primarily made up of benzene, tetrachloroethene, and trichloroethene. OU-3G is where the Del Amo and Montrose Superfund sites overlap. OU-3G addresses groundwater contamination from chlorobenzene, benzene, and various chlorinated solvents orginating form both the Montrose and Del Amo Superfund sites. The contamination has comingled, or mixed, between the Del Amo and Montrose Superfund sites, so EPA refers to it as the "dual-site groundwater." Currently, contamination has not been detected in groundwater that is used for drinking water. EPA is focused on protecting the drinking water supply for Torrance, Carson, Lomita, Gardena, Los Angeles, and the West Carson neighborhood of unincorporated Los Angeles County. To learn more about the cleanup plans at each of these OUs, read our latest fact sheet or check on the "Operable Units" page of this website. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed and cleaned up by the potentially responsible party (PRP), with oversight provided by U.S. EPA and California's Department of Toxic Substances Control. U.S. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. FIVE-YEAR REVIEW (2025): EPA will conduct the third Five-Year Review for the Del Amo Superfund Site in 2025. The purpose of the Five-Year Review is to evaluate the protectiveness of the remedial action ("cleanup"). The Five-Year Review will include a site inspection, extensive review of site data, and interviews with stakeholders and the community to assess protectiveness of the remedial action that was selected in the 2011 Record of Decision (ROD). We will complete the Five-Year Review report no later than September 30, 2025. When complete, EPA will post a copy on the report on this webpage and send a copy to the information repository. F﻿IVE-YEAR REVIEW (2020): The most recent review in 2020 concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by U.S. EPA and that the capping and soil vapor systems are effective in protecting human health and the environment.  Since 2019, EPA has studied vapor intrusion at eleven commercial buildings on the site.. These studies have shown that none of the buildings show evidence of vapor intrusion and this potential concern has been resolved. In May 2023, a soil vapor extraction system was installed and placed into operation at one of the properties at thesite. Operation of the system has acheived progress towards meeting the clean-up goals.

What Is the Current Site Status?
Del Amo Operable Unit 1 (OU-1): The remedy to treat contaminated soil and light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) is being implemented at the site. This puts us at the "remedial action" phase of the Superfund process. In May 2023, a soil vapor extraction system was installed and placed into operation. On March 5th, 2025, EPA deleted 46 acres of Del Amo OU-1 (16 percent of the entire site) from the National Priorities List (list of the most contaminated sites in the nation). When cleanup is complete at a portion of a Superfund site, EPA will "delete" or remove the area from the Superfund program. Documents related to this action can be found here. This deletion does not affect cleanup at the rest of OU-1 and the greater Del Amo site. Cleanup of the groundwater, wastepits and soils at the rest of OU-1 continues as normal. ﻿Del Amo Operable Unit 2 (OU-2): The waste pits at OU-2 are currently in the remedial action and operations, maintenance, and monitoring phase of the Superfund process, meaning the cleanup has been implemented and will be monitored to continue going forward. In 2020, we completed a performance monitoring evaluation which indicated that cleanup goals may have been met. Because of this, the soil vapor extraction system was shut off. The gas cap treatment system is still in operation, but an evaluation is currently underway to assess if this addtional system can be shut off. Monitoring continues to ensure contaminants are contained and do not spread outside the waste pits area. Del Amo Operable Unit 3G (OU-3G): This portion is also called "dual-site groundwater." The remedies to treat contaminated groundwater are currently in the remedial action phase of the Superfund process. There is an active pump and treat groundwater system for the chlorobenzene plume. The benzene plume is being monitored for intrinsic biodegradation, or natural breakdown of benzene by biological processes. Top of Page
Enforcement Information
Potentially responsible parties (PRPs) refers to companies that are potentially responsible for generating, transporting, or disposing of the hazardous waste found at the site. In 1991, EPA issued letters to Shell Oil Company and the U.S. General Services Administration, informing them that EPA considers them to be potentially responsible parties. In 1992, EPA signed an Administrative Order on Consent with Shell Oil Company and The Dow Chemical Company to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study for the site. SOIL AND NAPL (OU-1): On March 29, 2013, EPA issued "special notice" to Shell Oil Company and the U.S. General Services Administration in an attempt to resolve their responsibilities at the Soil & NAPL Operable Unit (OU-1). EPA entered into a Consent Decree with Shell Oil Company and the U.S. General Services Administration on January 14, 2016. The Consent Decree requires performance of the remedial design and remedial action at OU-1, reimbursement of EPA's past costs, and a commitment to pay EPA's future oversight costs. The California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) is also a party to the Consent Decree. (Updated March 2024) WASTE PITS (OU-2): On July 15, 1994, EPA issued a Unilateral administrative Order for Removal Response Activities requiring Shell to remove any waste material that seeps to the surface at the Waste Pits area. This order was active until EPA closed the order on September 20, 1999. On January 25, 1999, EPA issued Special Notice to the following entities informing them that EPA considers them to be potentially responsible for the response costs incurred in connection with the contamination at the Del Amo Waste Pits: Shell Oil Company, Dow Chemical Company, U.S. General Services Administration, USA Waste Incorporated, Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company, Michelin North America Incorporated, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company. On May 3, 1999, EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order for Remedial Action (cleanup) at the Waste Pits Area to the following entities, ordering them to implement the remedial action that EPA had chosen: Shell Oil Company, Dow Chemical Company, Michelin North America Incorporated (on behalf of itself and Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company), Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, and the U.S. General Services Administration. DUAL SITE GROUNDWATER (OU3G): EPA issued "special notice" to the following parties with respect to the groundwater at the Montrose and Del Amo sites, advising the parties that EPA expects them to enter into an agreement to implement the groundwater remedy, as set forth in the record of decision that EPA issued for the Dual Site Groundwater Operable Unit on March 30, 1999: Montrose Chemical Corporation of California, Bayer CropScience, Stauffer Management Company, News Publishing Australia Ltd., Shell Oil Company, Inc., United States General Services Administration, JCI Jones Chemicals, Inc., The Boeing Company, Weatherford Artificial Lift Systems, Inc., PACCAR, Inc., BP Amoco Chemical Company, American Polystyrene Corp., and Dianorys, Inc. In 2003, EPA issued unilateral enforcement orders to Montrose Chemical Corporation and Shell Chemical requiring that they perform certain preliminary steps of the remedial design. In 2008, EPA issued an additional unilateral enforcement order requiring Montrose and Shell to perform the formal pen-to-paper step of the design. Montrose and Shell performed the work under these orders under EPA oversight. EPA performed the computer modeling, step 3, with continual input from Montrose and Shell. On August 22, 2012, EPA filed a partial Consent Decree with Montrose Chemical Corporation for the construction of the Dual Site Groundwater Operable Unit treatment system. On November 12, 2021, EPA filed a partial Consent Decree with Montrose Chemical Corporation for the Dual Site Gruandwater Operable Unit Chlorobenzene Plume Remedy Operation and Maintenance. A Consent Decree for the remediation of the TCE-impacted groundwater at the sites is currently being negotiated (updated February 2024).  Top of Page
