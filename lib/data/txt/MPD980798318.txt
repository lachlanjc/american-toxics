### Background

The PCB Warehouse site was a shelter in Saipan, a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, where the Saipan government stored drums of contaminated liquids. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund programâ€™s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1986.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Removal actions included repacking and off-site disposal of contaminated drums and crates. After the removal actions, EPA tested the site and found that the wastes had not contaminated the site or its surroundings. Cleanup finished in 1984 and EPA determined that site conditions did not require further actions.
