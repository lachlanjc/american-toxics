### Background

Air Force Plant 85 is located near Columbus in Franklin County, Ohio. From 1941 to 1994, several companies, including Curtiss-Wright Corp., Rockwell International and McDonnell Douglas, made and tested naval aircraft and missile systems on site. Past operations at the 420-acre plant included machining, metal finishing, electroplating, forming, painting, coating and assembly. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. The Air Force sold the plant to a local investment group in 1997. The Air Force has retained proceeds from the sale to fund environmental investigations and cleanup. Site cleanup is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Site progress can be tracked at the [U.S. AF Civil Engineer Center website](https://www.afcec.af.mil/Home/BRAC/Wurtsmith/).

[Ohio EPA](https://www.epa.ohio.gov/cdo/afp85) has been involved in oversight of hazardous waste clean-up activities required under Ohio state laws for portions of the Site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The Air Force has completed significant cleanup activities at the plant. Prior to the sale of the plant, manufacturing and process area equipment was removed and cleaned. Numerous polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) transformers were removed, retrofitted and cleaned, and PCB-contaminated soil was removed. The former fire training area and Masonâ€™s Run have also undergone cleanup activities.

Of more than 100 areas identified, about 10 areas remain for additional investigation and cleanup. The Air Force will continue further investigations and cleanup at the remaining areas, which include former underground storage tank sites, process areas and Turkey Run.
