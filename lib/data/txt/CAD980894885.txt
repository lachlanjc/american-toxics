### Background

The 550-acre South Bay Asbestos Area Superfund site (site) is located in the Alviso District of San Jose, California. The site includes former landfills, a ring levee and truck yards. The Marshland and Santos landfills accepted asbestos containing material from an asbestos-cement pipe manufacturing plant from 1953 to 1982. Prior to joining the City of San Jose, the Alviso District erected a ring levee to protect low lying areas from flooding. The ring levee was built with locally quarried rock that contained naturally occurring asbestos. Wind and rain moved asbestos from the ring levee into areas of Alviso including several unpaved truck yards. EPA and the United States Army Corps of Engineers removed the ring levee, installed landfill caps, paved truck yards, and restored wetlands. The landfill caps require ongoing maintenance and inspection.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA conducted soil and air sampling around the Alviso District. EPA removed the ring levee and restored the surrounding wetland area. EPA paved truck yards that had asbestos in their soil. EPA installed landfill asphalt caps for the Marshland and Santos Landfills. The current property owners and managers of the commercial properties on the landfill caps are required to follow soil management plans and maintain these asphalt caps in perpetuity since asbestos containing material remains on site.

EPA completed five Five-Year Reviews of the siteâ€™s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The 2020 review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The long-term remedy included paving the asbestos-contaminated truck and industrial yards, wet-sweeping Alviso streets monthly, removing asbestos debris, installing landfill covers, implementing deed restrictions, and maintaining and monitoring the site. Remedial actions included the paving of four truck yards, installing landfill caps, removing the ring levee and restoring nearby wetlands. The landfill caps are required to have annual inspections and ongoing maintenance and repairs. Deed restrictions limit property use at America Center and Gold Street Tech Center. It is no longer necessary for the City of San Jose to wet-sweep the streets to control asbestos in street dust.
