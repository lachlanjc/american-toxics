### Background

The 142-acre Murray Smelter site is in Murray City, Utah. This former mineral processing area was once the largest lead smelter in the country. The site was formerly owned by the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO). The site included two smelters: the Germania Smelter and Refinery Works, which operated from 1872 to 1902, and the Murray Smelter, which operated from 1902 to 1949. In addition to lead, primary smelting byproducts included slag, arsenic and cadmium. Smelting activities and waste disposal practices contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater with heavy metals. The cleanup is complete. Today, the site is in operation and maintenance.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, municipal and potentially responsible party actions.

The EPA has done several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews make sure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review found that cleanup work at the site was done according to the plan chosen by the EPA. The remedy continues to protect human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Based on the January 2024 [Updated Lead Guidance](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/updated-soil-lead-guidance-cercla-sites-and-rcra-corrective-action-facilities), the EPA is evaluating the risks from lead in soils to sensitive populations. This analysis will include compiling available site data to determine the potential presence and extent of lead-contaminated soils. Lead can pose health risks to sensitive populations, especially children under 7 years old and pregnant or nursing women. The process to implement the Updated Lead Guidance will involve additional planning, data gathering, risk assessment and funding requests. EPA will coordinate with our state partners and request public feedback on our proposed cleanup plans before additional cleanups begin.

While implementing the Updated Lead Guidance may take up to five years to complete, the EPA and Utah Department of Environmental Quality will share information on planned activities and results as they become available. In the meantime, and out of an abundance of caution, if you live near the Murray Smelter Superfund Site, the EPA recommends you have your children tested for lead annually; especially those under 7 and if the soil at your property was not replaced previously. Additionally, you can take some simple actions to limit exposure to potential lead contamination in soils, including:

- Maintaining yards and other soil cover;
- Washing hands, especially children’s, after handling soil, playing outside, and before meals;
- Making sure children eat nutritious meals high in iron and calcium;
- Keeping dust levels down by mopping and damp dusting regularly;
- Regularly changing out furnace filters;
- Keeping kids’ toys and play areas clean;
- Taking shoes off at the door and keeping pets clean;
- Wearing gloves while gardening; and
- Cleaning homegrown produce and peeling root vegetables.

The EPA Murray Smelter Superfund Site team will communicate with residents affected by this guidance about the specific next steps the Agency will take in their community. Residents may also contact the site’s Community Involvement Coordinator with questions or concerns at ( [haniewicz.missy@epa.gov](mailto:haniewicz.missy@epa.gov?subject=Murray%20Smelter%20Superfund%20Site) ) or 720-415-4609.

The EPA proposed the site for listing on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in 1994, but the listing was never finalized. Instead, the EPA and ASARCO, the site’s potentially responsible party, signed settlement agreements for site investigations and cleanup. The EPA and Murray City also signed an agreement allowing the city a formal role in the Superfund process.

Cleanup activities included:

- demolition of two on-site smokestacks
- removal and replacement of lead-contaminated soils on off-site residential properties
- natural attenuation of groundwater contaminants
- excavation and off-site disposal of soil contaminated with high levels of arsenic
- excavation, on-site consolidation and capping of 90,000 cubic yards of soil containing lower levels of arsenic
- long-term groundwater monitoring; and institutional controls

Site cleanup took place between 1995 and 2001. Monitoring is ongoing.
