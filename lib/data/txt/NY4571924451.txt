### Background

The Griffiss Air Force Base (AFB) site is located in Rome, New York. The 3,552-acre base began operations in 1943 under the Air Combat Command and served as home to various Air Force operations over the years. By 1959, the Strategic Air Command (SAC) activated the 4039th Bombardment Wing, which was replaced by SAC's 416th Bombardment Wing in 1963. The 416th Bombardment Wing remained at Griffiss until the 1990s. The mission of the 416th Bombardment Wing was to maintain and implement effective air refueling operations and long-range combat air power. In 1993 and 1995, Griffiss AFB was designated for realignment under the Base Realignment and Closure Act. As a result, the 416th Bombardment Wing was deactivated in September 1995. While active base operations have now ended and been relocated to other areas across the country, the Rome Laboratory, Northeast Air Defense Sector and the Defense Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS) still operate at the base.

During its 50 years of operation, the base generated hazardous wastes from various activities including: aircraft operation; testing and maintenance; firefighting exercises; discharge of munitions; landfill operations; and research and development activities. Over the years, these wastes were disposed of in landfills and dry wells located across the base which led to investigations into contamination that could pose threats to public health and the environment.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In the late 1980’s, residents in the Town of Floyd became concerned when contamination was discovered in a number of private groundwater wells located in the town. The Air Force began providing bottled water to affected residents as a short-term action in 1990 and provided funds to the community to extend the municipal water supply. By late 1991, hook-ups to the water supply extension were available and most residents believed to have been affected by the groundwater contamination took advantage of the new water supply. Extending the water line and providing access to safe drinking water eliminated the potential for people to be exposed to hazardous substances from groundwater in this area. An EPA-funded program to sample and test residential wells over a wider area determined that contamination in off-base areas was not more extensive than previously found in Floyd. The EPA and the New York State Department of Health (NYDOH) conducted a joint monitoring program over a one and one-half year period to determine if off-base well contamination extended beyond the Floyd area. The results of the sampling program were negative which showed that the contamination was limited. Additional investigations that have been performed at the former Griffiss AFB since that time have showed that contamination has not migrated off-base.

Since the early 1990’s, the Air Force has addressed groundwater contamination on the base using systems that extract and treat the groundwater. Several of these systems are still operating. Some smaller areas of groundwater contamination have already been addressed and no longer pose a threat to human health and the environment. The Air Force has cleaned up contamination at all source areas at the base. The base landfills have been capped and groundwater monitoring at the landfills has been conducted since the 1990’s. The Air Force restricts access to sites at the base where cleanup has not been completed via fencing, signs, and gates. In some contaminated areas, the selected cleanup plans have called for limiting the type of land use in that area (via land use controls / institutional controls (LUC/ICs), and property transfer documents). The Air Force periodically samples all areas where groundwater contamination has been found. Extracting groundwater in these areas is prohibited through the use of LUC/ICs incorporated into property transfer documents and all deeds for transfer. Additional restrictions on land use, such as restricting land use to non-residential uses, and restrictions that address soil vapor intrusion (SVI), have also been incorporated into the applicable cleanup plans and property deeds. Vapor intrusion occurs when there is a migration of vapor-forming chemicals from contaminated groundwater or soil into an overlying building. Sub-slab Vapor Mitigation (SSVM) systems to address SVI have been installed at four buildings.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

**Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Investigations:**

PFAS History

Fire-fighting training exercises conducted at the base since 1970 included the use of aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) containing PFAS. Other potential PFAS sources include aircraft crash and fire areas, AFFF storage and testing areas, and fuel spill areas.

Work Performed

The Air Force conducted a Site Investigation (SI) of the base fire training area in 2015 to test for 14 PFAS compounds in soil, groundwater, surface water, and sediment at and down-gradient of the site. PFAS were detected in the soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment. PFAS levels in the groundwater and surface water were above the EPA Health Advisory Level (HAL) of 70 parts per trillion (ppt) combined for drinking water for the PFAS compounds perfluorooctanyl sulfate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).

In 2015 and 2016, the Air Force reviewed off-base areas within one mile of the former base and performed a well survey. Based on that review, the Air Force determined that all residences within the one-mile radius had been connected to municipal water. In addition, there are no drinking water wells on Air Force-retained property and only one non-drinking water well on base property. This well was sampled and no PFAS were detected. The well survey included the golf course irrigation system, which was also found to be on municipal water. In late 2017, the Air Force reinitiated an off-base well survey in response to a request from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC). The Air Force worked with the City of Rome to identify properties on municipal water and matched them up with local tax records to identify any additional potential groundwater users within four miles of the base boundary. The Air Force survey was completed in 2018 and did not identify any groundwater users within four miles of the base boundary.

The Air Force conducted a base-wide Preliminary Assessment in 2015 to identify other areas at the base where PFAS may be present so that sampling investigations could be performed. This assessment identified 17 additional areas to investigate, which included aircraft crash and fire areas, AFFF storage and testing areas, fuel spill areas, and receiving surface water bodies.

In 2016, the Air Force started a base-wide Site Inspection for the 17 AFFF sites identified in the Preliminary Asessment, as well as one additional area. The EPA reviewed the draft Site Inspection Report and submitted comments to the Air Force in June 2017. The Air Force submitted a final Site Investigation Report in November 2018. The EPA's comments on the report included a request for additional sampling, which is discussed below under "Next Steps."

Next Steps

The Air Force has said that it will eventually conduct a follow-up Remedial Investigation (RI) to determine the full nature and extent of PFAS contamination at the Fire Training Area and AFFF investigation sites where PFAS was found. The timeframe for this is not clear, however, and will likely be based on regulatory standards for PFAS set by NYSDEC and/or the EPA. The Air Force has no further PFAS investigations planned over the short term due to current Air Force policy, which calls for additional investigations only at areas where there have been impacts to drinking water supplies. There are currently no known PFAS impacts to drinking water supplies at or near Griffiss AFB. The EPA has made two specific requests for follow up sampling: PFAS sampling at the former base boundary, and sampling of the two creeks. The results from the Site Investigation showed that the two creeks have been impacted by PFAS contamination. Additional follow-up sampling of the creeks will eventually be needed because the creeks flow past the former base boundary. Also, AFFF areas upstream of the Mohawk River were impacted by PFAS contamination. These areas will need to be investigated further. The Mohawk River may also require further investigation.

**Other Ongoing Site Investigations and Cleanups:**

The Air Force has carried out several other studies and investigations to locate, assess and quantify toxic and hazardous waste storage, disposal and spill sites. As a result of numerous cleanup actions conducted by the Air Force to protect human health and the environment, under current conditions at the site, potential or actual human exposures are under control. The site’s long-term cleanup is ongoing.

Historical operations at the base generated hazardous wastes that contaminated groundwater with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at portions of the base, including trichloroethene (TCE), dichloroethene (DCE), and vinyl chloride. Soil at various locations has been contaminated with heavy metals, including lead, chromium, and barium, as well as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Military munitions wastes from a former small arms range and munitions storage areas has also contaminated soil at the former base. Contaminated liquids from the landfills, discharges from old storm sewers, and accidental spills have contributed to contamination of the creeks. PCBs and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) have been found in Three Mile and Six Mile Creeks. Pollutants from these sites may be harmful to wildlife and aquatic life. People who touch or accidentally consume contaminated soil may suffer negative health effects. The movement of contaminanats in groundwater and surface water has been studied and addressed base-wide with respect to the potential for negative impacts on people and wildlife, including off-base groundwater users. Under current conditions, there is little to no risk to human health from contaminated groundwater at the base because groundwater is not being used as a drinking water supply. Approximately 95 percent of the local population now obtains water from the City of Rome municipal water supply system. However, exposure could occur if new property owners or their tenants were to install drinking water wells on their property. The Air Force conducted additional studies related to potential health risks due to soil vapor intrusion (SVI) of VOCs into buildings.

Since the late 1980s, the Air Force has completed preliminary assessments (PAs), site investigations (SIs) and remedial investigations (RIs) at over 80 sites at the base. This includes extensive sampling and analysis of soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment.

Cleanup of hazardous waste contamination at the base has been addressed through a series of short-term and long-term actions by the Air Force, with oversight by the EPA, NYSDEC and NYSDOH. To date, cleanup decisions (Records of Decision ) have been made for 39 areas, or operable units (OUs), at the base. Each one addresses a particular site, contaminant source or environmental medium. One additional cleanup decision is expected. The Air Force has completed cleanup actions at five of the sites (the base landfills). Cleanup actions at several other sites are ongoing.

Several of the cleanup decisions called for no further action. These were typically in response to the successful completion of previous short-term cleanup actions by the Air Force. In addition, several cleanup decisions called for land use controls/institutional controls (LUC/ICs), rather than active cleanup remedies. About 2,900 acres of the former base has been taken off the Superfund National Priorities List.

The remaining 600 acres of the former base will remain on the National Priorities List and continue through the Superfund cleanup process to completion. All property at the site has been transferred to outside parties. Prior to transfer, the EPA, NYSDEC and NYSDOH reviewed property transfer documents in accordance with Superfund requirements for the transfer of federal property, and provided the necessary approvals as required under the Superfund law. For the transfer of parcels where cleanup had not yet been completed, the approval of the Governor of New York State was also obtained.

Finally, the Air Force has identified additional areas of interest (AOIs). Most of these sites have been evaluated, investigated and determined to require no further work. However, two AOIs were classified as areas of concern (AOC)s. The cleanup decision for the "AOC 9" site was approved in September 2010. The source of contamination was removed, and in-place treatment of groundwater contamination is currently ongoing. The Air Force is currently performing a pilot study to address soil vapor intrusion concerns at one additional building at the site. A pilot study is a preliminary test or study of the program or evaluation activities to try out procedures and make any needed changes or adjustments.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Because the base was realigned and closed under the federal Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) program in 1993 and 1995, property at the base has been returned to the community for reuse through a series of transfers to outside parties. As a result, the former base is currently occupied by many different types of entities, including industrial, commercial and residential facilities and a large portion of the former base is now operating as Griffiss International Airport.

Current and future property owners are bound by any land use controls/institutional controls (LUC/ICs) in their property deeds until their removal is approved by the Air Force, EPA, and NYSDEC. The Air Force conducts an annual survey at all former Air Force property containing LUC/ICs. During this process the Air Force contacts all applicable property owners and requests that they fill out a new questionnaire each year. The Air Force also conducts inspections of each property. The Air Force compiles the results into an annual report that is reviewed by the Air Force, EPA, NYSDEC, and NYSDOH. Any violations of the LUC/ICs are then addressed with the landowner(s) by the Air Force and regulatory agencies.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Since the late 1980’s, the Air Force has conducted Preliminary Assessments (PAs), Site Investigations (SIs), and Remedial Investigations (RIs) at over eighty sites at the base. This includes extensive sampling and analysis of soil, ground water, surface water and sediment. Detailed information on all of these studies, as well as information about the long-term sampling and monitoring still being conducted at the base, is available at the Administrative Record for Griffiss AFB, located at

### Enforcement Information

The EPA placed the site on the Superfund Program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in July 1987. The Air Force used its Department of Defense (DoD) Installation and Restoration Program (IRP), originally established in 1978, to conduct hazardous waste investigations and cleanup activities at sites placed on the EPA NPL. An inter-agency (Federal Facilities) agreement signed by the Air Force, EPA and NYSDEC in June 1990 outlined the framework for investigation and cleanup. The Air Force is the lead agency for these activities. The EPA, NYSDEC, and NYSDOH provide oversight of the program.
