Background
The 57-acre Mid-South Wood Products site is located in Polk County, Arkansas. Site activities included sawmill and wood-preserving operations.

Following construction of the site’s remedy, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires reevaluation of the groundwater remedy and an amended Record of Decision (ROD). Nebraska Bridge Supply & Lumber Company developed the plant site in the late 1930s. In 1955, the facility operated under the name of Three States Lumber Company. The primary activity was pressure treating of lumber. Edward Hines Lumber Company purchased the site property in 1967 and operated the plant as a PCP and creosote wood treatment facility. In 1977, Hines converted the operation to a CCA wood-treating process. In 1978, Mid-South acquired the property from Hines and has since continued to use the CCA process until the 1990s. All wood-treating operations have now ceased.Nebraska Bridge Supply & Lumber Company developed the plant site in the late 1930s.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site’s long-term remedy included excavation of heavily contaminated materials and stabilized wastes, on-site consolidation of contaminated soils and other materials, a cap to contain the wastes, and groundwater pumping and treatment. Construction of the remedy finished in 1989. The groundwater treatment system operated until 2006. EPA is currently evaluating whether to reactivate the system. Operation and maintenance activities related to the cap and groundwater monitoring are ongoing.
