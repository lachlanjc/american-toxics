### Background

The five-acre Diaz Chemical Corporation site is located in Holley, New York. There are residential properties to the north of the site near Jackson Street and to the east on South Main. The site includes a parking lot and a warehouse on land owned by Diaz Chemical. The site is bordered by Conrail railroad tracks to the south and west, and there is undeveloped land and a group of buildings that are now vacant. The nearest municipal drinking water supply well is over a half mile south of the site.

In the 1890’s, the property was used for tomato processing and cider vinegar production before Diaz Chemical purchased it in 1974. Diaz Chemical was a manufacturer of specialty chemicals for the agricultural, pharmaceutical, photographic, color and dye, and personal care products industries.

The Diaz Chemical facility had a long history of spills, releases, and discharges of various materials to the environment that dated back to about 1975. In 2002 a reactor vessel in a process building overheated, causing its safety valve to rupture and release approximately 75 gallons of a chemical mixture through a roof stack vent. A mixture of steam, [toluene](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts56.pdf), and 2-chloro-6-fluorophenol and other chemicals were released. The mishap impacted a residential community northeast of the facility. Soon after the release, people experienced sore throats, headaches, eye irritation, nosebleeds, and skin rashes. Some residents relocated to area hotels with assistance from Diaz Chemical.

Diaz Chemical filed for bankruptcy and abandoned the facility, leaving behind large volumes of chemicals in drums and tanks.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Diaz Chemical initially investigated the site from 1994 to 1999, under the direction of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC). Their investigation found that the soil and groundwater on the property and nearby areas were contaminated with volatile organic compounds and semi-volatile organic compounds. NYSDEC issued a cleanup plan documented in a Record of Decision (ROD) in 2002 that included groundwater extraction via an interceptor trench and treatment. Diaz Chemical subsequently installed a groundwater extraction and treatment system.

Actions to clean up the site began in 2002, when the State of New York obtained a court order that required Diaz Chemical to continue to fund the relocations until an appropriate environmental and health assessment was performed for the affected neighborhood. After Diaz Chemical claimed it could no longer afford to pay for the relocations, EPA assumed responsibility for the relocation expenses. EPA sampled the air, soil, interior surfaces, and household items in the impacted area. EPA also secured the site and removed contaminated materials, drums, piping, reactor vessels, and storage tanks.

From 2003 to 2007, EPA secured the site and removed all hazardous substances within drums and tanks, removed facility piping, and dismantled the Diaz Chemical production buildings. EPA shipped over 8,000 drums and over 112,000 gallons of hazardous wastes off site for reuse or disposal. The agency also emptied and decontaminated a total of 105 reactor vessels and 34 storage tanks and sent the vessels and tanks for recycling or disposal. EPA also dismantled and removed over 51,000 feet of pipes (accounting for 95 percent of the existing piping) and recovered and disposed of about 800 gallons of waste within the piping. EPA also recycled over 750 tons of scrap metal and 500 tons of concrete and disposed of over 1,200 cubic yards of debris and 3,100 tons of contaminated concrete.

EPA finalized a cleanup plan for the site in 2005 that included buying eight homes and permanently relocating eight owner-occupants and two individual tenants who remained in temporary quarters at that time. EPA continued its assessment of the contamination at the site 2005. EPA sampled groundwater through monitoring and collected soil samples both on the site property and residential areas. EPA also sampled nearby homes to determine if vapors from the site were getting into them. Based on the indoor air sampling results, EPA installed vapor mitigation systems at two homes in 2007. One basement had flooding issues, so EPA replaced a vapor system with a carbon filtration system in 2009. The agency also installed a carbon filtration system in another home.

In 2012, EPA selected a cleanup plan for in-situ (in place) thermal treatment of contaminated soil and groundwater located at the Diaz Chemical property and natural processes to address the groundwater contamination downgradient of the source areas. The cleanup plan also included demolishing the building in order to access to contaminated soil on site.

EPA determined that site-related contamination does not exist in the surrounding residential area. A cleanup for the neighborhood, including the eight EPA-owned residential properties, was not necessary. EPA does continue to operate and maintain three existing residential vapor mitigation systems. EPA transferred the eight EPA-owned properties to the Village of Holley Development Corporation (VHDC) in June 2017. The VHDC, working with a local realtor and law firm, sold all the houses in September 2017.

EPA demolished all of the remaining on-site buildings except for Warehouse 9, which is located to the north of Jackson Street across from the main property, and Warehouse F, located on the facility proper. EPA first cleared six buildings of debris and hazardous materials before demolishing them. EPA identified and removed asbestos-containing materials, fluorescent bulbs, and PCB ballasts (light fixtures). EPA segregated the demolition debris for salvage and recycling or disposal in a hazardous waste landfill and shipped 860 tons of construction and demolition debris off-site for proper disposal.

Approximately 1,200 feet of a 12-inch water main crossed the property. Because thermally treating the contaminated soil and groundwater would likely affect the water in the water main, in advance of the cleanup, in 2016, EPA relocated the waterline.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) oversaw the construction and operation of the thermal treatment system to clean up the site contamination. EPA and USACE began the first phase of the thermal treatment in 2018, which treated about 10 percent of the contaminated soil and groundwater on-site. The second stage, which will treat the remaining 90 percent of on-site contamination, began in June 2021. This work is being performed in two phases. Because of operational issues with the phase 1 thermal treatment system, the system was shut down in 2021 for repairs. Following the completion of the repairs, the system was turned back on in 2023. Post-remediation confirmatory soil samples were collected in March 2024. Phase 2 will follow.

EPA issued the first Five-Year Review report for the Diaz Chemical site in March 2022 to confirm cleanup actions continue to protect people’s health and the environment. EPA regularly reviews cleanups every five years to ensure they remain effective.
