### Background

The 58-acre North Railroad Avenue Plume site is a contaminated groundwater plume in Española, New Mexico. The Norge Town laundromat and dry cleaning operation contaminated groundwater with tetrachloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (DCE) and trans-1,2-DCE. The contaminated groundwater aquifer is the sole-source drinking water aquifer for the City of Espanola, Santa Clara Pueblo and individual water supply wells near the site. The population of Espanola is 10,224 people. The Santa Clara Pueblo has a population of 2,400 people.

The remedy consists of enhanced in-situ bioremediation. The areas targeted for cleanup are the Source Area and Hot Spot soils and shallow groundwater contaminated with non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) chemicals, a dissolved phase plume in the shallow aquifer, and dissolved-phase plumes in several water-bearing zones in the Deep Zone aquifer.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and local actions.

EPA selected the remedy for the site in a Record of Decision signed on September 27, 2001. The remedy consisted of in-place treatment of saturated soil in the Source Area and a Hot Spot near the source area using surfactant or co-solvent treatment, *in-situ* bioremediation of dissolved-phase plumes in the shallow and deep aquifers, soil vapor extraction to treat unsaturated soil in the Source Area.  EPA signed an Explanation of Significant Difference in 2008 to change the surfactant/co-solvent treatment to *in-situ* bioremediation using Enhanced Reductive Dechlorination (ERD) and eliminate soil vapor extraction.

The New Mexico Environment Department implemented the remedy through a State Cooperative Agreement with EPA. Construction of the remedy was completed in 2008. A ten-year long-term response action (LTRA) began in 2009 following one year of operational and functional performance testing.

In 2014 and 2015, EPA's Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation conducted an optimization study at the site to evaluate current ERD performance, adequacy of the monitoring program, and cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the remedy. EPA's optimization study indicated that the remedy has been successful at significantly reducing contaminant mass in the soil and shallow ground water, although additional characterization and remediation was recommended to clean up the residual contamination at the Source Area and Hot Spot. The study also indicated that the Deep Zone remedy was not effective. The study recommended that additional characterization of the Deep Zone aquifers be performed to improve the understand of groundwater flow and plume extent. With this information, the merits of continuing with the existing remedy or evaluating the feasibility of another remedial alternative for the Deep Zone can be assessed. Additional characterization of the soil and shallow ground water in the Source Area and Hot Spot was initiated in the summer of 2015 as recommended. The findings and recommendations of the optimization study are presented in the March 2015 report entitled "Optimization Review Report, Long-Term Response Action Stage, North Railroad Avenue Plume Superfund Site, Espanola, Rio Arriba, New Mexico, EPA Region 6."

EPA conducted five-year reviews of the site’s remedy in 2010 and 2015. These reviews are to determine whether the remedies put in place are protecting public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The 2015 review concluded that a protectiveness determination of the remedy could not be made until additional information was obtained to assess the potential for contaminant vapors to move upward from the shallow groundwater contaminant plume through the soils and into homes (referred to as indoor air vapor intrusion). The 2015 five-year review also concluded that there was currently no known human exposure to contaminated groundwater. The permitting of new water wells over the area of ground water contamination is currently restricted by the NM Office of State Engineer while remediation is ongoing. Recommendations were made in the 2015 five-year review to optimize or enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the remedy and to conduct additional characterization at the Source Area, Hot Spot, and Deep Zone.

EPA performed an indoor air vapor intrusion remedial investigation (RI) at the site beginning in 2017 to evaluate the potential for contaminant vapors sourced from the shallow groundwater plume to move upward through soils and enter (intrude) into homes. The investigation was performed in an area where the highest contamination levels in shallow groundwater were found. It consisted of two phases: a soil gas survey (Phase 1) and indoor air sampling (Phase 2). The soil gas survey, which was performed first, showed contaminant vapors to be present in the soils at concentrations high enough to potentially enter into homes at unsafe levels. Indoor air sampling was then performed at homes and other buildings in those areas of high soil vapor concentrations. The indoor air sample results showed no presence of site-related contaminants at concentrations exceeding EPA's health-based screening levels for indoor air. A final vapor intrusion RI report will be completed by July 2020. Following completion of the vapor intrusion RI Report, an amendment to the 2015 five-year review report will be completed to document EPA's remedy protectiveness determination.

On June 30, 2019, the federally-funded 10-year LTRA was transferred to the state of New Mexico for continued operation and maintenance (O&M) in accordance with the Superfund law and the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP).

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

NMED is currently performing activities to optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of the bioremediation remedy at the Source Area, Hot Spot, and Deep Zone. This work included additional injections of amendments at the Source Area and Hot Spot, an evaluation of the potential for monitored natural attenuation for the Deep Zone aquifers, and a Deep Zone investigation to further characterize the aquifers and extent of the contaminant plumes. The Deep Zone investigation included the drilling and installation of additional monitoring wells that was completed in March 2020.

NMED is also conducting a pilot study on new and improved types of treatment materials (amendments) that may be better (less viscous than the regular emulsified vegetable oil) at flowing through an aquifer and reaching more areas of contamination. NMED has developed a plan to implement an enhanced treatment strategy that will adress the deep zone contamination as well as residual contamination in the Source Area. This work is ongoing in 2020.

NMED has begun decommissioning and demolition work on compontents of the bioremediation systems installed for the shallow groundwater contaminant plume, including removal of injection wells and well vaults. The shallow plume downgradient of the Source Area and Hot Spot has been successfully cleaned up and the treatment systems are no longer needed.

EPA initiated the third five-year review of the site remedy in October, 2019, to determine if the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. A site inspection and interviews with stakeholders were performed in November, 2019, and community and government stakeholder meetings were held in December, 2019. The five-year review will be completed by September 2020.

### Sampling and Monitoring

NMED continues to collect groundwater samples as part of the ongoing groundwater monitoring program. Additional monitoring wells were installed and sampled for the Deep Zone aquifers in 2018, 2019, and 2020. A draft report entitled "Additional Investigation of Deep Zone" (August 2019) presents the 2019 data. The 2020 groundwater data will be evaluated and summarized in a supplemental report on the Deep Zone later this year.

Other draft reports prepared by NMED that contain environnmental data are (1) Final Report and Evaluation of 2017 Carbon Substrate Injections in Source Area and Hot Spot (September 2019), (2) Deep Zone Monitored Natural Attenuation Evaluation (October 2019), and (3) 2017-2019 Long-Term Response Action Report (December 2019). These draft reports are currently being reviewed by EPA.

The analytical results of the EPA 2017 and 2018 soil gas survey and indoor air sampling are presented in the following documents: Phase 1 Data Evaluation Technical Memorandum (March 9, 2018); Phase 1 Screening Assessment for Indoor Air Vapor Intrusion Pathway, Revision 01 (March 19, 2018); and Phase 2 Data Evaluation Technical Memorandum (August 16, 2019).
