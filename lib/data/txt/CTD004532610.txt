### Background

The Revere Textile Prints Corp. site is located in Sterling, Connecticut. The 15-acre area is located in a town-owned industrial park. A textile processing facility first operated on site over 50 years ago as the U.S. Finishing Company. Facility operations and poor storage practices led to soil and groundwater contamination.

In 1978, Revere Textile was allegedly observed dumping barrels of wastes into the Moosup River. The facility was destroyed by fire in 1980. Following the fire, a number of drums were evident in the ruins of two buildings on site. The property was sold after the fire in 1980. At the time, there were over 1,500 on-site drums that leaked dyes, paints, solvents and heavy metals onto the ground. The state detected over 30 compounds in the drums and soil on site and issued an order against the new owner to clean up the site. In 1982, ownership of the site transferred to Sterling Industrial Park Corporation. After several state inspections and rounds of sampling, the drums were removed in 1983 by the new owner. An unknown quantity of contaminated soil also was removed. On-site monitoring wells were sampled in 1984 and found to be contaminated.

The site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in July 1987.

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1994.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, municipal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. In 1983, the Town of Sterling removed more than 1,500 drums containing dyes, paints solvents and heavy metals. The town removed an additional six drums and paint cans from the site that contained solvents, oils, naphthalene and VOCs in 1990. The town also placed restrictions on site land uses, specifically limiting non-commercial development and groundwater use.

EPA completed an investigation into the nature and extent of site contamination in 1992. EPA determined that, due to the immediate actions taken by the town, the level of contamination was no longer harmful to the surrounding population or environment and no further action was necessary.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Low levels of contamination are present at the site, but the levels are no longer harmful to the surrounding population and the environment. Before cleanup, the site was contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from dyes, paints and solvents. Heavy metals were also present. Sampling detected more than 30 compounds in the drums and soil on site. Site cleanup actions removed these contaminants.

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1994.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional Controls are not required for this site.**

This site does not require ICs which means there is no contamination remaining at the site that could result in an unacceptable exposure and/or remedy components at the site that could be damaged. For additional information on this site, the site contacts should be consulted:  
ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
