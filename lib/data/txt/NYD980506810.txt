### Background

The Hooker (102nd Street) Landfill site is located in Niagara Falls, New York. The 22.1-acre site includes two areas. Occidental Chemical Corporation, formerly Hooker Chemical and Plastics Corporation, owns 15.6 acres. Olin Chemical Corporation owns the remaining 6.5 acres. Landfill operations on both areas from the 1940s to the early 1970s contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, EPA put the site’s long-term remedy in place.

The larger portion of the landfill operated from 1943 until 1971. During that time, about 23,500 tons of mixed organic solvents, organic and inorganic phosphates, and related chemicals were deposited at the landfill. Brine sludge, fly ash, electrochemical cell parts and related equipment, and 300 tons of hexachlorocyclohexane process cake, including lindane, were deposited at the site. The smaller portion of the landfill operated from 1948 to about 1970. During that time, 66,000 tons of mixed organic and inorganic chemicals were deposited. In addition, about 20,000 tons of mercury brine and brine sludge, more than 1,300 tons of a mixture of hazardous chemicals, 16 tons of mixed concrete boiler ash, fly ash and other residual materials were disposed of at the site.

Following immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, and site investigations, EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List in September 1983. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the National Priorities List in August 2004.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Immediate Actions: In 1972, the site was capped, a fence was placed on three sides and a bulkhead was installed along the Niagara River.  

Long-term Cleanup: Following a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the nature and extent of the contamination and to evaluate remedial alternatives, EPA selected the site’s remedy in the site’s September 1990 Record of Decision, or ROD. It included the installation of a synthetic-lined cap; consolidation of off-site soils beneath the cap; surrounding the waste mass with a slurry wall; dredging and incineration of highly contaminated sediments; dredging, dewatering and consolidation, beneath the cap, of remaining contaminated sediments; recovery and treatment of groundwater; incineration of any recovered dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL); monitoring; and restricting access to the site by installing additional fencing.  

Design of the remedy started in October 1991. EPA updated the remedy in June 1995. The update eliminated the incineration contingency whereby all highly contaminated sediments in the embayment would have to be incinerated if they were to remain outside the final positioning of the slurry wall. The slurry wall has since been redesigned to run as close to the shoreline as is practical and still contain any migration of the DNAPL plumes. Cleanup activities started in April 1996.

Remedial action activity began in April 1996. The construction of the slurry wall along with excavation of contaminated sediments from the embayment finished in 1996. A permanent synthetic/clay cap over the landfill was put in place in 1997. Construction of the remedy finished in March 1999, when the force main system for pumping leachate from the landfill to the Love Canal Treatment Facility became operational. The system pumps sufficient leachate from the landfill to maintain an inward gradient across the slurry wall. The leachate pumping system reached the steady-state phase in November 2000.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site was addressed in two phases: immediate actions and a long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.  

The construction of a circumferential slurry wall around the entire site, the installation of a leachate collection and pumping system, the installation of a permanent, synthetic/clay cap over the landfill, and the erection of new fencing to restrict access, have virtually eliminated the potential of exposure to contaminants at the 102nd Street Landfill Site. Data will be collected to verify that the discharge of contaminants into the Niagara River has been eliminated.

Following completion of cleanup activities, EPA took the site off the National Priorities List in August 2004.
