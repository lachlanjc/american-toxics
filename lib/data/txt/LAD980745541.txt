### Background

**Current Status**

Five-Year Review status – The process for the sixth Five-Year Review has been completed. The EPA and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality conducted a site inspection on December 12, 2017, to evaluate the protectiveness of the remedy. The sixth Five-Year Review was signed final on July 10, 2018; at that time the remedy remained protective of human health and the environment. The site is currently in operation & maintenance status. The routine annual groundwater monitoring will continue to ensure protectiveness of the EPA cleanup actions. Additionally, annual inspections of the cap are conducted to ensure integrity. Because waste is contained in a clay cap system, the site is not suitable for general reuse.

**Site Background**

The 265-acre Bayou Sorrel site is located in Iberville Parish, Louisiana. A hazardous waste landfill operated on site from 1977 to 1979. Waste disposal operations took place on about 50 of the 265 acres. Wastes were disposed of in two sludge pits, four liquid waste ponds, two drum burial cells and one landfarm area. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil, sludges, surface water and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL).

**National Priorities Listing (NPL) History**  
Proposal Date: December 30, 1982  
Final Date: September 8, 1983  
Deletion Proposal Date: June 4, 1997

**Location:** 20 miles SW of Baton Rouge, six miles north of the Town of Bayou Sorrel. Section 40-43, Township 10 South, Range 10 East, in Iberville Parish, Louisiana.

**Population:** Approximately 100 year round residents within 5 miles of site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  
  
Over a million cubic feet of waste have been contained in a slurry-walled, multi-layered clay cap system. All contaminants have been contained, and exposure potential has been eliminated. The cleanup ensures protection of nearby sensitive environmental areas as well as protection of underlying aquifer used by thousands of people in Iberville Parish. The cleanup includes extensive monitoring to ensure protectiveness. EPA continues to monitor the area to make sure the site is safe and no longer poses a threat to public health or the environment.  
  
EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

A hazardous waste landfill operated on site from 1977 to 1979. The site (particularly the south end) and surrounding areas have a marshy, bayou-type environment and are prone to periodic flooding and poor drainage.

About 7,000 people live in Plaquemine, 13 miles northeast of the site. The town of Bayou Sorrel is six miles south of the site and due north of the Bayou Sorrel waterway. About 1,000 residents live along the bayou and in the town of Bayou Sorrel. There are about 30 seasonal fishing camps across the Upper Grand River from the North Area Cap. The Borrow River lies between the site and the Atchafalaya River Basin levee.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The long-term remedy included regrading the site to control runoff, covering former waste disposal areas with topsoil/geomembrane/clay caps, installing a sand/geofabric porewater drainage, installing a slurry wall, and groundwater monitoring. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1997. Unauthorized access and use of the site and surrounding property is restricted. The site is not currently in use, except for activities associated with operation and maintenance activities and monitoring.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The October 1990 Remedial Action Report documents the Remedial Action activities performed at the site, and includes construction quality assurance inspections and tests that showed the slurry wall, porewater collection system, clay cap, geomembrane, sand layer, topsoil, hydromulch, fence and access roads were constructed with specified materials and products, were installed using the specified construction procedures and conformed to the specified performance criteria., and initiation of operation and maintenance (O&M) activities (SDMS #136469). EPA initiated a fund-lead Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) at the site to define the nature and extent of the contamination and to obtain data to develop and analyze remedial alternatives. The EPA conducted the field sampling portion of the RI from March to May 1984, collecting and analyzing soil, sediment, ground water, surface water and biological samples. In March 1985, additional ground water samples were collected and analyzed. The final RI Report was completed in December 1985, and the Feasibility Study (FS) Report was completed in February 1986.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Prior to the site’s placement on the NPL, the state closed the site and took actions to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. The site closure reportedly included consolidation and capping of the contents of several ponds. Closure activities finished in 1979.
