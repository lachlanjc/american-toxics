### Background

The 9-acre General Dynamics Longwood [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site (also known as the Gould Property) is located at 1333 North U.S. Highway 17-92, in a commercial and light industrial area of Longwood in Seminole County, Florida. The General Dynamics site is located north of the Sprague Electric Company site. A vacant property is located to the east of the site and Big Tree Park is located to the west and north of the site. Several unused buildings are located on the site.

General Dynamics Corporation or its affiliates manufactured printed circuit boards and other electronic equipment at the site from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s. Workers cleaned manufactured products with vapor degreasers on site. Cleaning agents in the vapor degreasers included chlorinated solvents. In 1994, a new owner purchased the property and used it as a publication business. The site is currently not in use and is on the market for sale.

After initial investigations, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 2010 because of soil and groundwater contamination. EPA believes that contaminated groundwater from the site has merged with contaminated groundwater from the adjacent Sprague Electric Company site.

Site contamination does not currently threaten local residents living and working near the site. One [potentially responsible party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) has placed filters on two private drinking water wells. All other residents and businesses use the local public water system for drinking water.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA has identified PRPs that could potentially undertake or support site investigations and cleanup. EPA is currently negotiating with the PRPs to perform the site’s remedial investigation and feasibility study, which will guide the cleanup.

**1986 – 1987**  
As a result of state of Florida consent orders, legal documents signed by a judge in 1986 and 1987, Sprague Electric Company has taken corrective action measures and site assessments along the southern boundary of the site for more than 20 years. The Sprague Electric Company site is hydraulically upgradient (uphill) from the General Dynamics Longwood site.

**2010**  
EPA listed the site on the [NPL](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n).

**2022**  
The [Site Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) Report](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11138138.pdf) was completed by the Potentially Responsible Parties and approved by the EPA in January 2022. Based on the information and recommendations from the RI/FS Report, the EPA is issuing a Proposed Plan to propose the final cleanup strategy for all of the contamination still remaining at the site. This [Proposed Plan](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11138147.pdf) will be available for public comment from July 29, 2022, until August 28, 2022. A virtual public meeting to discuss the Proposed Plan will be held by the EPA on August 16, 2022. The EPA will review and consider all comments received from the public. After the end of the public comment period, a Record of Decision (ROD), which will include aresponse to the public comments, will be prepared. This ROD is anticipated to be completed by the EPA on or before September 30, 2022.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has not yet approved a cleanup plan for the site. After the [Record of Decision](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#r) is completed, the EPA will work with the site’s [Potentially Responsible Parties](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) to develop a cleanup plan and perform the site’s final cleanup.

Currently, the site is in use as a parking lot by Auto Dealership. Also the site is on going remedial design and remedial action.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA identified Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) that could potentially undertake or support site investigations and cleanup. EPA is currently negotiating with the site’s PRPs to perform the site’s remedial investigation/feasibility study.
