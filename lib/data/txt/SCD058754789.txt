### Background

The 61.5-acre Aqua-Tech Environmental, Inc. (Groce Labs) [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, five miles east of Greer and a mile east of Duncan. Site surroundings include commercial businesses to the north, rural homes to the east, Maple Creek and a heavily wooded area to the south, and a tree farm to the west. The site is currently vacant.

The site includes the area where the City of Greer operated a municipal landfill from 1940 to 1968. Groce Laboratories purchased the site property from the City of Greer in 1974 and began operating a hazardous waste treatment, storage and reclamation facility over the former landfill. Aqua-Tech Environmental, Inc. (Aqua-Tech) purchased the operation in 1987 and continued to accept, store, and treat most hazardous wastes as well as a variety of other solid wastes.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1994 because of contaminated groundwater, surface water and soil resulting from facility operations. EPA, the [South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC)](https://www.scdhec.gov/) and the site’s [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site. By treating soil, monitoring groundwater and enforcing institutional controls, EPA, SCDHEC and the site’s [potentiallty responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

The site is fenced and secured. Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. People living nearby have access to the public water supply.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**1991**  
On September 4, 1991, after several citizen complaints and environmental violations, SCDHEC ordered the closure of the facility due to the large volume of improperly stored hazardous waste and the imminent threat to public health. Following the facility's closure, EPA and SCDHEC emergency response personnel discovered 7,000 drums and lab packs, 97 above-ground tanks, 1,200 gas cylinders, unexploded ordinance material, and small amounts of low-level radioactive material and biohazard material at the site. Many of the drums, tanks and cylinders were deteriorating, leaking and improperly stored.

PRPs completed the removal and stabilization of these materials in 1994. EPA and SCDHEC initially led short-term cleanup actions. The Aqua-Tech PRP group conducted an extensive cleanup action from 1992 to 1994. The PRP Group is leading long-term site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and SCDHEC.

**2003**  
EPA issued a cleanup plan (a [Record of Decision, or ROD](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/10098837.pdf) ) for the site. Because the site is located within the Greenville-Spartanburg “Airport Environs Area,” residential development, churches, day care facilities or other similar uses are not permitted. EPA might require an institutional control in the form of a restrictive covenant in the future to restrict well drilling and the construction of buildings over the former landfill. The site is fenced and secured.

**2010**  
The PRP Group completed the installation of the landfill cap. The PRP Group is currently treating contaminated soil using a soil vapor extraction system.

**2011**  
In March 2011, the PRP Group completed full-scale ground water cleanup activities involving chemical injections. The PRP Group will continue to monitor ground water until it meets site cleanup goals.

**2012**  
During 2012, EOA completed the Remedial Action Project Completion Report and implemented institutional controls on site property.

**2015**  
The first Five-Year Review site inspection was held on March 2015 and a report was issued later that same year.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA completed the site’s [second Five-Year Review i](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11155291.pdf) n September 2020.

The remedy currently protects human health and the environment because contaminated soils in the northeastern portion of the Site are being treated and covered by a RCRA Subtitle C cap and a RCRA Subtitle D soil cap has been placed over the closed MSWL to eliminate exposure to contaminated soil and waste.

Groundwater has been treated to reduce groundwater contaminant concentrations in source areas and site contaminants of concern have not migrated off site. In addition, institutional controls are in place to prevent exposure to soil and at most site parcels for groundwater.

The PRP group will continue to oversee the landfill cap and operate the soil vapor extraction system and continue to monitor the site’s groundwater.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The site is fenced and secured.

Because the site is located within the Greenville-Spartanburg “Airport Environs Area,” residential development, churches, day care facilities or other similar uses are not permitted.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The PRP Group will continue to monitor ground water until it meets site cleanup goals defined in the ROD.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

From 1982 through 1991, Groce Laboratories and Aqua-Tech entered into six legal agreements with SCDHEC to address regulatory violations at the site. The EPA then negotiated legal agreements with the PRP Group to investigate and clean up the site. The EPA finalized legal agreements in 1992, 1995 and 2006. The PRP Group continues to fund site-related cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
