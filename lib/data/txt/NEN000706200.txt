Background
The PCE Southeast Contamination Site is in York, York County, Nebraska. The site was previously identified as two separate sites: the York PCE Site and the Southeast York Groundwater Site. Tetrachloroethene (PCE) and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including trichloroethene (TCE) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), have been identified in private drinking water wells at concentrations exceeding 5 micrograms per liter - the EPA maximum contaminant level for these VOCs. The EPA initiated a Time-Critical Removal Action in 2011 to address the drinking water and vapor intrusion human exposure pathways. Since 2011, 27 vapor mitigation systems have been installed and 16 residential properties have been connected to the public water supply (two additional residences received whole-house filters). The site was proposed for the National Priorities List in December 2013 and was officially listed on the NPL in May 2014. The EPA conducted the remedial investigation/feasibility study at the site between July 2014 and September 2021. The RI/FS data was used to support the selection of a remedy that eliminated, reduced or controlled risks to human health and the environment. The RI/FS involved the investigation and study of contaminated soil and groundwater at the source area(s) and associated groundwater contaminant plumes. Field investigation activities determined the nature and extent of the contamination and fully delineated the groundwater contaminant plumes. The RI determined contamination from multiple former dry-cleaning businesses are contributing to the groundwater contamination.  In 2017, the site was separated into multiple operable units (OU). OU1 is designated as the 7th Street source area soil, OU2 is designated as the 5th Street source area soil and OU3 is designated as sitewide groundwater contamination. A Record of Decision (ROD) was issued on Sept. 19, 2018, to address soil contamination at the 7th Street source area (OU1). The selected remedy included In Situ Thermal Remediation of the source area soil. The EPA completed the remedial design in September 2019.  In 2020, the EPA completed the OU2 and OU3 FS, which evaluated the remedial alternatives to address the remaining soil and groundwater contamination. A virtual public meeting was held April 15, 2021, to present the preferred remedial alternatives for OU2 and OU3. There were no questions or comments received during the public meeting that suggested changes in, or opposition to, the Preferred Alternatives presented in the Proposed Plan. The OU2 and OU3 ROD was issued on Sept. 28, 2021. The selected remedy for OU2 (5th Street source area) included ISTR of the source area soil and the selected remedy for OU3 (sitewide groundwater) includes pump and treat to remediate the contaminated plume. The long-term remedial strategy for the site will be managed as a phased approach. The OU1 and OU2 source area remedial actions will be conducted prior to beginning the OU3 remedial design. This phased approach is preferred as it will initially focus on eliminating the continued leaching potential of the soil contamination into the water table, thereby preventing further impacts to the drinking water aquifer. The EPA awarded a remedial action contract on September 19, 2022, to conduct ISTR at OU1 and OU2. The work at OU2 began in March 2023. Remedial action work began at OU1 in February 2024. Startup operations of the ISTR system at OU2 began in March 2024. Asbestos Removal and building demolition (outlined in the OU1 ROD Explanation of Significant Differences or ESD) at OU1 were completed by early May 2024 and drilling/installation of the ISTR system is underway at OU1 in winter 2025. Treatment of the soil source contamination continues at OU-2 and is nearing completion. Soil confirmation sampling (to determine if the contamination has been removed to soil cleanup levels) is scheduled for February through April 2025. Site restoration will follow if confirmation samples are below cleanup levels. The treatment system at OU-2 will be moved to OU-1 following completion of soil cleanup at OU-2. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The EPA began a time-critical removal action in 2011 to eliminate, through the provision of permanent alternate water supply or through installation of whole-house filtration systems, human exposures resulting from the inhalation, dermal contact, and/or ingestion of PCE, and/or other hazardous substances present in the groundwater at the site. The removal action also addresses the vapor intrusion pathway by the collection of sub-slab and indoor air samples and implementation of mitigation measures where necessary. Since 2011, 27 vapor mitigation systems have been installed and 15 residential properties have been connected to the public water supply. Groundwater and vapor intrusion sampling activities are ongoing to ensure exposure pathways are not complete. An In Situ Thermal Remediation system has been installed at OU2 and is currently treating/removing soil contamination. Soil treatment at OU-2 is nearing completion with soil confirmation sampling expected between February and April 2025. Once soil has acvieved remediation targets, the treatment system will be relocated to OU-1 (tentatively late spring 2025).The In Situ Thermal Remediation system works by heating the ground and converting soilcontamination to a vapor. The contaminated vapors are captured via an extraction system and treated with granulated activated carbon.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The EPA is conducting an ongoing time-critical removal action to mitigate any current and future potential exposures to site contaminants. Response actions include collecting indoor air and sub-slab air samples to assess potential/actual human health exposure. As necessary, the EPA will install whole house drinking water filtration systems, vapor mitigation systems or connect residences to the public drinking water supply. The EPA conducted the RI/FS at the site to select a remedy that eliminated, reduced, or controlled risks to human health and the environment. The RI/FS involved the investigation and study of contaminated soil and groundwater at the source area(s) and associated groundwater contaminant plumes. Field investigation activities determined the nature and extent of the contamination and fully delineated the groundwater contaminant plumes. The RI determined several former dry-cleaning businesses are contributing to the groundwater contamination. In 2017, the site was separated into OUs. OU1 is designated as the 7th Street source area soil, OU2 is designated as the 5th Street source area soil, and OU3 is designated as sitewide groundwater contamination. A ROD was issued on Sept. 19, 2018, to address soil contamination at the 7th Street source area (OU1). The selected remedy included In-Situ Thermal Remediation (ISTR) for the source area soil treatment. The EPA completed the remedial design in September 2019. The OU1 ISTR project began in February 2024 with the support of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) funding. In 2020, the EPA completed the OU2 and OU3 FS, which evaluated the remedial alternatives to address the remaining soil and groundwater contamination. A virtual public meeting was held April 15, 2021, to present the preferred remedial alternatives for OU2 and OU3. There were no questions or comments received during the public meeting that would suggest changes in or opposition to the Preferred Alternatives presented in the Proposed Plan.  The OU2 and OU3 ROD was issued on Sept. 28, 2021. The selected remedy for OU2 (5th Street source area) included ISTR treatment of the source area soil and the selected remedy for OU3 (sitewide groundwater) includes pump and treat to remediate the contaminated plume. The EPA developed a remedial design for OU2 to support the ISTR remediation.  The long-term remedial strategy for the site will be managed as a phased approach. The OU1 and OU2 source area remedial actions are being conducted prior to beginning the OU3 remedial design. This phased approach is preferred as it will initially focus on eliminating the continued leaching potential of the soil contamination into the water table, thereby preventing further impacts to the drinking water aquifer. 
The EPA initiated Remedial Action construction in March 2023 at Operable Unit 2 located at 5th Street and N. Platte Avenue. Construction activities have included drilling and installation of vertical, angled, and horizontal In Situ Thermal Remediation (ISTR) wells, temperature sensors wells, and vapor extraction wells. Placement of a vapor cap over the area to be treated and plumbing of the ISTR system was completed in fall 2023. On December 6, 2023, the EPA was informed by its contractors that the system that treats the collected contaminated vapor would be delayed due to ongoing supply chain and staffing issues with the U.S. and global economies. The treatment system components arrived spring 2024 and the ISTR system startup was completed late spring/early summer. Contamination treatment is underway. Site restoration at Operable Unit 2 is planned for early 2025. During fall 2023 and winter 2024, the EPA worked with property owners of the soil source area at Operable Unit 1 (7th Street and N. Platte Avenue) to demolish the building located on the northeast corner of the intersection. Asbestos removal occurred February to April 2024, followed by demolition of the structure in late April. Demolition was completed in early May 2024. Drilling and installation of the ISTR system at Operable Unit 1 is underway and will continue through early 2025. Once soil cleanup/restoration at Operable Unit 2 is complete (springearly 2025), the treatment system will be moved to Operable Unit 1 (7th Street and N. Platte Avenue). The EPA and its contractors are conducting inspections and repairs on existing vapor mitigation systems (VMS) related to the site and will continue these activities through summer 2025, if necessary. Select vapor intrusion sampling of some new/existing businesses occurred during Spring 2024 (and will continue as needed through summer 2025) and vapor mitigation systems will be installed in any businesses with vapor intrusion issues.

Sampling and Monitoring
The EPA and its contractors will be conducting vapor intrusion sampling and vapor mitigation system maintenance at various buildings and businesses in downtown York, NE during spring and summer 2024. The purpose of the sampling will be to verify whether additional vapor mitigation systems are necessary in new businesses and to evaluate whether maintenance on exisitng systems is necessary.

Emergency Response and Removal
The EPA began a time-critical removal action in 2011 to eliminate, through the provision of permanent alternate water supply or through installation of whole-house filtration systems, human exposures resulting from the inhalation, dermal contact, and/or ingestion of PCE, and/or other hazardous substances present in the groundwater at the site. The removal action also addresses the vapor intrusion pathway by the collection of sub-slab and indoor air samples and implementation of mitigation measures where necessary. Since 2011, 27 vapor mitigation systems have been installed and 15 residential properties have been connected to the public water supply. Additional Removal Actionsoccured during spring/summer 2024 to sample for vapor intrusion issues at new businesses and to assess whether exisitng systems required maintenance. Four systems needed fan replacements (completed) and a vapor mitigation system and additional fan replacement are planned for early 2025. The Removal Action is scheduled to be closed by 9/30/2025 via a final PolRep.
