Background
The Pesses Chemical Company site is located at 2301 South Main Street in Fort Worth, Tarrant County, Texas. The area is triangular in shape and about 4.2 acres in size. Operations to reclaim cadmium and nickel from dry-cell batteries and metal sludge began on site in 1979 and ended in 1981. Facility operations impacted soil with metals contamination. Following immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, and construction of the site’s long-term remedy, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1995. Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
 The site is being addressed through federal and state actions. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. All former buildings have been demolished and removed. Remediation of the site is complete. Wastes are stabilized and protected below a concrete cap. Protection of human health and the environment has been achieved. Institutional controls were added to the remedy in 2007. TCEQ prepared institutional controls as deed notices in accordance with the Texas Risk Reduction Program (TRRP). 
Operations to reclaim cadmium and nickel from dry-cell batteries and metal sludge began in 1979. The facility formerly included four furnaces fired by natural gas. The furnaces were heated to separate cadmium from the mixture in the form of cadmium oxide gas. The cadmium oxide gas was condensed into a liquid in condensers and then poured into molds. Furnace emissions were composed of numerous metal oxides and other particulates. These furnace emissions were conveyed to a cyclone separator and then to a baghouse filter before discharging to the atmosphere. In February 1980, cadmium emissions were measured as high as 2,900 percent of the 0.01-pound-per-hour permit limits. In January 1981, the parent company filed for bankruptcy and operations at the Fort Worth plant ended. The site is located about two miles south of downtown Fort Worth and a half-mile west of Interstate 35W. The former operations area consisted of a metal warehouse that originally contained various pieces of equipment, a baghouse, two underground sumps and a storage yard with a concrete pad. The metal warehouse was demolished and removed in 2011. The brick office building and the brick warehouse were also removed. The Cenikor Drug Rehabilitation Foundation borders the site to the north. An active railway switching yard borders the site to the east and much of the south. South Main Street borders the site to the west. The site is situated in a light industrial and commercial area.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site’s long-term remedy, selected in 1988, included decontamination of the old warehouse and in-place stabilization and capping of contaminated soils and site contaminants. This remedy removed the principal threat posed by site conditions, eliminating the possibility of human exposure to metal contaminants and preventing spread of the contaminants. Construction of the remedy finished in 1992.Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) maintains the integrity of the cap and site security. TCEQ conducts annual inspections of the site and also mows the area three to four times a year.After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1995.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
On September 27, 2012, TCEQ filed a deed notice on the site property, which meets the institutional control requirement established by the 2007 ESD and Texas Risk Reduction Program standards for commercial/industrial use. The deed notice prohibits the following land uses and activities without prior approval from TCEQ. Any use other than commercial/industrial use; well drilling; removal or modification of the paved concrete surface or building foundations, capped area or fencing; and activities that will cause erosion or disrupt the integrity of the paved concrete surface or the capped area. In addition, the City of Fort Worth has zoned the site and surrounding areas for heavy industrial use, which prohibits residential use.

Emergency Response and Removal
Cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. A removal action by EPA in 1983 took away 3,392 cubic yards of contaminated soil, metal sludge, drummed material and debris from the site. An interim clay cover was installed over the process area. Topsoil was removed from inside the fenced area and from the south field where piles of slag were found. Surface soils along the roadside and railroad tracks and behind the warehouse were also removed.
