Background
Fort Detrick (Frederick) is an active U.S. Army Installation operated under the Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), in Frederick, Maryland. Fort Detrick is located within the city limits of Frederick and is surrounded by residential areas and county-owned land. Fort Detrick consists of four tracts of land called Area A, Area B, Area C Water Treatment Plant, and Area C Wastewater Treatment Plant. Area B Groundwater is the only area of Fort Detrick that is currently on the National Priorities List (NPL). Area B occupies approximately 399 acres and was initially established as a proving ground in the Army's Biological Warfare program. Later, Area B was used as a disposal area for chemical, medical, and radiological (CBR) material. Area B has been the primary location of waste management activities for Fort Detrick and is the location of an active municipal landfill, animal farm, former skeet range, former explosives storage area, and former waste disposal/test areas associated with former research activities. In the late 1940s, the Special Operations Group of Fort Detrick installed a test grid in Area B to test simulant biological warfare (BW) materials. Biological simulants are defined as living microorganisms, not normally capable of causing infection, representing the physical and biological characteristics of potential microbiological agents and considered medically safe to operating personnel and surrounding communities. No pathogenic open-air anti-personnel tests are documented to have occurred at Fort Detrick. A list of the live simulant materials used in Area B is not available, but it is known that simulant materials used included live Bacillus globigii, Serratia marcescens, and Escherichia coli. Test animals were buried in trenches or pits located in Area B after autoclave sterilization. Sterilized Bacillus anthracis was buried in Area B. In addition, radiological tracer materials were reportedly buried at three locations in Area B, including radioactive carbon, sulfur, and phosphorous. Two cylinders marked "Phosgene" were also reportedly buried in Area B. Phosgene is extremely toxic by acute (short-term) inhalation exposure. Many types of test munitions were tested on the grid in Area B; however there is not an unexploded ordnance issue due to how the testing was carried out. In the early 1970s, after the United States outlawed biological research for offensive operations, a decontamination program was initiated for Fort Detrick. Decontamination procedures for residual biological/chemical research materials included autoclave steam sterilization and incineration. Incineration ash from the destruction of rice blast fungus was tilled into soil in the northwestern corner of Area B (Pit 13). Research buildings and equipment were also decontaminated, and an extensive wipe sampling program was completed after decontamination. In 1977, severe soil erosion exposed buried scrap materials and created several deep cavities in Area B. The areas were subsequently covered with soil. Since 1999, quarterly groundwater sampling has been conducted from wells on Area B to include the area around Area B-11 and downgradient. Groundwater sampling activities include monitoring wells and drinking water wells along the southern facility boundary of Area B. The volatile organic compounds (VOC) trichloroethene (TCE) and tetrachloroethene (PCE) are the major chemical constituents detected in groundwater. Additionally, TCE also was detected in a residential well located on the southern portion of Shookstown Road. Most of the drinking water wells near Fort Detrick have been closed, and affected residents were connected to public water supply. In 1992, groundwater samples collected from six drinking water wells located to the southeast of Area B along Shookstown Road and Montevue Lane contained concentrations of TCE above the cancer risk screening concentration or at concentrations meeting the criteria for documenting Level I actual contamination (the concentration is above a benchmark and also meets observed release criteria). One of these wells contained TCE and PCE concentrations above their respective drinking water maximum contaminant levels (MCLs); and another contained TCE concentrations above the MCL. All of the affected properties along Shookstown Road and Montevue Lane were initially provided bottled water and were connected to public water supplies by 1999.  In September 2005, two groundwater samples collected from residential wells on Kemp Lane contained TCE or PCE at concentrations above detection level but below the MCL meeting the criteria for documenting Level I actual contamination.  Subsequent routine sampling of the wells did not have any detections above MCLs.  All of the potentially affected properties along Kemp Lane were initially provided bottled water and were connected to public water supply in 2017.  Area B-11, also known as Pit No. 11, is reported to have received various types of waste chemicals from Fort Detrick, the National Bureau of Standards, and the Walter Reed Army Medical Center from 1955 to 1970. Reportedly, eight 55-gallon drums of TCE were disposed of in 1968, most likely in the Pit No. 11 area. Wastes disposed of in the pits included metals, wood, general waste from laboratory modifications and building demolition, refuse from housing and animal farm operations, acids and chemicals, incinerated medical waste, waste herbicides and insecticides, phosgene, and animals potentially contaminated by Bacillus anthracis.  Animal carcasses were reportedly sterilized before burial.  Area B-11 is underlain by solution-weathered limestone of the Frederick Formation, a karst formation aquifer. Solution features such as voids were identified in Area B-11 during the installation of monitoring wells. The voids are 10 to 87 feet long and were encountered with the greatest concentration in the first 100 feet of drilling. The nature of karst conditions in Area B-11 increases the probability of releases to groundwater from wastes disposed of in Area B-11. Wastes may have been disposed of directly into karst solution cavities (voids) resulting in possible groundwater contamination. From 2001 to June 2004, the Army performed an interim removal action (IRA) at several chemical waste pits within Area B-11.  The waste pits removed were believed to be significant source of TCE and PCE within the B-11 Area. Removal activities included the removal of contaminated soil, chemical containers, compressed gas cylinders, and laboratory waste. During excavation, live preserved bacteria was found in sealed glass containers. A non-pathogenic (non-disease causing) form of Bacillus anthracis was found in several of the glass containers.  After the initial finding, IRA operations were temporarily halted until the project was upgraded to incorporate new safety and testing procedures.  After the removal action was completed, the Army implemented a policy preventing any future intrusive work in disposal areas on Area B. While a removal action was performed at the B-11 area, wastes still remain onsite.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Fort Detrick Area B Groundwater (Fort Detrick) was proposed to the National Priorities List (NPL) on September 3, 2008 as part of the NPL Proposed Rule #49. Four Source Areas were identified at Fort Detrick in the NPL proposal including: (1) Area B-11 Landfill; (2) Area B-2 Landfill; (3) Area B-Grid; and (4) Area B-20 South Burn Area. Other possible source areas identified in the NPL proposal narrative include 30 additional areas that required investigation. Fort Detrick Area B Groundwater was finalized on the NPL on April 9, 2009 as part of the NPL Final Rule #46. A Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) between the U.S. Army (Army) and EPA was signed on December 17, 2010. The FFA describes the procedures under which the Army, the Maryland Department of the Environment, and the EPA will investigate and, if necessary, remediate sites at Fort Detrick in accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). After review of public comments, the FFA was made effective in the fall of 2011. No Record of Decision (ROD) has been jointly signed by the EPA and the Army to date at Fort Detrick. A ROD is the official document that establishes how each site will be remediated. The remedial investigations, studies and fieldwork continue, additional monitoring wells and sampling are being planned in 2022 to further delineate the nature and extent of groundwater contamination on the northwestern (Area-B-3 landfills) and southwestern boundary of Area B (Western Disposal Area – Area B-8, B-10, B-18 and B-11 landfills).
What Is the Current Site Status?
Site Investigation There is currently 1 operational unit (OU) under investigation which may require a cleanup at the site. The Army has the lead role for cleaning up at Fort Detrick Area B Groundwater. Site Management Plan Per the Federal Facilities Agreement between EPA, MDE and the Army, a Site Management Plan (SMP) is annually updated with activities at each operable unit and area of concern. The September 2024 SMP can be found here.   ﻿Five Year Review The lead agency, the Army, conducts five-year reviews (FYR) of the site to ensure the cleanup still functions as intended and is protective of human health and the environment. The 2019 FYR is available to view. The 2024 FYR is currently under review. The next FYR is due on June 24, 2029.

Emergency Response and Removal
Cleanup actions to date have included the Area B-11 chemical waste pit Interim Removal Action, a skeet range contaminated soil removal project, capping at six former landfill disposal areas, ; and providing residents alternate water through bottled water and ultimately connection to public water supplies. In addition, several phases of a pilot study to reduce volatile organics in surface water were conducted in an offsite pond, into which some groundwater from Area B discharges.  A pilot study to tests technologies for contaminant mass removal in the Western Disposal Area source area is currently underway. A pump and treat system was constructed, and began operation in 2021. After completion of the pump and treat study in May 2022, the Army will test the effectiveness of an enhanced reductive dechlorination study.
