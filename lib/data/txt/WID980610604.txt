Background
The 23-acre Refuse Hideaway Landfill is located in Dane County, Wisconsin. The landfill operated between 1974 and 1988. Approximately 1.2 million cubic yards of waste were disposed of during those years. The landfill owner reported receiving a variety of commercial and industrial waste including barrels of glue, paint, ink and ink washes, spray paint by-products and paint stripper sludge, and spill residues containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  The presence of leachate seeps in 1986 and operational problems at the landfill prompted the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to begin regulatory actions against the owner. The landfill was closed under court order in 1988 when VOCs were discovered in several private wells southwest of the site and in groundwater surrounding the site. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The cleanup, which was originally completed by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources in 1998, included an upgrade to the existing landfill cap; operation and maintenance of the cap; gas and leachate collection systems; and extra point-of-entry water treatment systems for affected homes.  Although the site has been deemed "clean," very low levels of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including perchloroethene, trichloroethene and vinyl chloride, still exist in soil and groundwater on the site
Long-term protectiveness requires compliance with land-use restrictions that prohibit interference with the cap; restrict any land use that would allow the continued presence of human exposure; and limit groundwater use. Compliance with state-required institutional controls known as “continuing obligations” will be accomplished by monitoring and enforcing them. Site cleanup components will also be maintained.  This has been in place since 2013.

What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA completed a five-year review of the Refuse Hideaway(PDF)(77pp, 4.6MB, About PDF) Superfund site in September 2017.  The site is located on U.S. Highway14, Middleton, Wis. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This was the third review of the site. This review included an evaluation of background information, cleanup requirements, effectiveness of the cleanup, and maintenance and monitoring efforts. It also looked at ways to operate more efficiently. The review concluded the cleanup is protecting people and the environment.  The next review is scheduled for 2022. The five-year review report and other site-related information are available at the Middleton Public Library, 7425 Hubbard Ave. and under Reports and Documents on this web page. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
