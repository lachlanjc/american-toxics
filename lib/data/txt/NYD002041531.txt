### Background

The 126-acre Lawrence Aviation Industries, Inc., or LAI, Superfund site in Port Jefferson Station, New York, manufactured products from titanium sheet metal, including golf clubs and products for the aeronautics industry, from 1959 through 2003. The LAI facility is no longer operating. The site property was previously part of a turkey farm owned by LAI's corporate predecessor, Ledkote Products Company of New York, from 1951 to 1959. The LAI facility included 10 buildings in the southwestern portion of the property; an abandoned, unlined earthen lagoon west of the buildings used for liquid wastes; a former drum crushing area south of the buildings; and about 80 acres of vacant, wooded area referred to as the "Outlying Parcels." The site also includes an area of contaminated groundwater, known as a groundwater plume, to the north of the LAI facility, under a primarily residential area. The former LAI facility property has been inactive and unoccupied since 2004, and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, or NYSDEC demolished 10 abandoned manufacturing buildings in March 2024.

LAI’s past disposal practices throughout its operating time at the site caused a variety of contaminant releases, including [trichloroethene](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts19.pdf), or TCE,  [tetrachloroethene](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts18.pdf), or PCE, acid wastes, bases, oils, sludge, metals, and other industrial wastes. Additionally, in an effort to "clean up" its facility in 1980, LAI reportedly crushed more than 1,600 drums, allowing their liquid contents to spill onto unprotected soil.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the Suffolk County Department of Health Services and the NYSDEC conducted several inspections and investigations at the site that documented various environmental concerns. Surface samples from sumps, puddles, laboratory cesspools, and surface water run-off at the LAI facility contained high levels of fluoride, toluene, carbon tetrachloride, and heavy metals. Inspectors found that adjacent residential wells were contaminated with fluoride, nitrates, TCE, 1,2-dichloroethene, PCE, and heavy metals. In 1997, a limited investigation by NYSDEC determined that releases of hazardous substances from the LAI facility had contaminated soil, groundwater, surface water, and sediment onsite, along with groundwater that moved beyond the borders of the LAI property. The EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List, or NPL, in February 2000.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The EPA has taken actions to clean up the site in several stages both before and after listing the site on the NPL. The EPA first took short-term actions to minimize immediate threats and reduce potential sources of further contamination at the site, then focused on the long-term cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination in coordination with the NYSDEC.

**Short-term Actions:**

***Drinking Water:*** In 1987, the EPA provided bottled water to residents whose wells were found to exceed levels of [trichloroethene](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts19.pdf), or TCE, above EPA standards. The agency then connected the homes with private wells impacted by groundwater contamination to public water supplies. In the 1990s, the Suffolk County Water Authority, under contract with the NYSDEC, connected additional homes impacted by LAI’s groundwater contamination to public water supplies.

***Drums:*** In the early 1990’s, the EPA and the NYSDEC removed from the site more than 2,000 drums containing acetone, acids, bases, oils, inks, and untreated acidic sludges, as well as numerous types of solid wastes. The EPA removed and disposed of another 1,300 drums of waste materials containing various flammable solids, acids, bases, gas cylinders, and unknown compounds in 2004. In March 2005, the EPA removed 13.5-tons of transformers and capacitors filled with suspected polychlorinated biphenyl, or PCB, liquids from the site for proper disposal. By removing drums containing hazardous chemicals, the two agencies eliminated some sources of contamination to the underlying groundwater.

***Asbestos-containing materials:*** In 2014 and 2015, the EPA removed and disposed of off-site, asbestos-containing material, mercury, and acidic liquids from an active scrap salvaging operation in Building G, run by the property owner.

**Long-term Actions:**

Following work to determine the nature and extent of site contamination, and to evaluate clean up alternatives, the EPA finalized a cleanup plan for the site that was documented in the [September 2006 Record of Decision](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/02/95839), or ROD. The selected cleanup plan included excavating or removing contaminated surface soil on the LAI facility; installing groundwater pumping and treatment systems both at the LAI facility and within the plume area (where contaminants disperse) near Old Mill Pond to address contaminated groundwater; using in-situ (in place) chemical oxidation of areas where there are high concentrations of contamination in groundwater at the LAI facility; sampling and removing all of the 30 electrical transformers, with proper disposal of leaking or PCB-containing transformers; conducting long-term groundwater monitoring; and implementing institutional controls. [Chemical oxidation](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/HQ/401601.pdf) uses chemicals called “oxidants” to help change harmful contaminants, such as the TCE or PCE at the site, into less toxic ones, generally water and carbon dioxide; it is commonly described as “in situ” because it is conducted in place, without having to dig up the soil or pump groundwater for aboveground cleanup.

The EPA finished removing about 17,000 tons of PCB and lead-contaminated soil primarily from the former drum crushing area and sending it to be disposed of at an approved off-site disposal facility in 2009. The EPA removed three leaking electrical transformers in 2014 and NYSDEC removed an additional 20 leaking transformers in 2019. The seven transformers that remain on site are liquid-tight and do not contain PCBs above regulated concentrations.

In 2010, the EPA finished installing two groundwater pumping and treatment systems, one at the LAI facility and the other within the plume area near the Old Mill Pond, or OMP. The LAI facility groundwater treatment system prevents additional contaminated groundwater from moving off the LAI facility by removing and treating contaminated groundwater onsite. The treatment system at the OMP facility extracts and treats contaminated groundwater that may have migrated beyond the LAI facility, aiming to prevent the movement of contaminated groundwater into the Old Mill Pond, Old Mill Creek, or the Port Jefferson Harbor. The EPA transferred responsibility to the NYSDEC for operating, maintaining, and sampling monitoring wells for both groundwater treatment systems.

***LAI Facility Property Redevelopment:*** In March 2024, the NYSDEC finished demolishing all abandoned buildings at the site in order to facilitate redevelopment of the LAI property. Between October 2023 and February 2024, they demolished fifteen buildings (including the10 dilapidated former manufacturing buildings); removed abandoned machinery; removed three aboveground propane tanks for reuse (a 30,000 gallon tank and two 15,000 gallon tanks); and cleaned debris from 29 machine pits and sumps. The demolition project resulted in the NYSDEC removing and properly disposing of approximately 2,315 tons of asbestos containing material debris, and recycling approximately 2,500 tons of steel. In addition to the solid wastes, the NYSDEC’s contractor drained all fluids from machinery and electrical transformers; 39 drums of PCB transformer oil and 60,000-gallons of oily impacted water extracted from the former machine pits were removed and shipped for proper disposal.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA proposed to delete the land, soil, and groundwater (not the groundwater plume) portion of the LAI Superfund site from the NPL in August 2024 based on its finding, with NYSDEC agreement, that the cleanup at these portions of the site is protecting people and the environment, and no further work is needed. However, some restrictions will remain on how the LAI land may be used. Additionally, the groundwater pump and treat systems will remain in operation by the NYSDEC, along with regular sampling to monitor progress of the long-term groundwater cleanup.

In addition to coordinating with the NYSDEC in the ongoing groundwater monitoring, the EPA continues to conduct a formal review of the site and all systems every five years, known as a “Five Year Review”. This thorough review uses site inspections, detailed record reviews, and discussions with the operators to ensure that the remediation systems are operating properly, that the current cleanup methods are still the best approach for the specific site and contaminants, and that the approach protects people’s health and the environment.
