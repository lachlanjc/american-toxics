### Background

The Coalinga Asbestos Mine site covers 120 acres near Coalinga, California. The site consists of partially demolished mill buildings and a process waste mine tailings pile that occupies about 20 acres. Two large open-pit mines are located above the mill site and were used as the sources of ore for Coalinga Asbestos Company milling operations. Facility operations contaminated air, soils, sediments and surface water with asbestos. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1998.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The next review for the site will be completed by September 2026.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site was addressed in two long-term remedial phases directed at cleanup of the Coalinga Asbestos Mine (Johns-Manville Mill) and the City of Coalinga contaminated areas.

Remediation of the Coalinga City area finished in 1993. It included excavating and consolidating 20,000 cubic yards of asbestos, chromium and nickel-contaminated soil and building debris; building an underground waste management unit (WMU) to contain and dispose of contaminated soil and waste on site; covering the WMU area with an impermeable cap; regrading the excavated area; decontaminating the debris; monitoring soil, groundwater and air; and implementing deed restrictions limiting land use.

The Coalinga Asbestos Mine (Johns-Manville Mill) cleanup finished in 1995. It included diverting stream flow away from the tailings pile by building a cross-canyon stream diversion; minimizing the release of asbestos into a nearby creek by improving the existing sediment trapping dam; paving the road through the Mill Area to suppress dust; dismantling the mill building and disposing of the debris; and limiting access to the site by erecting a fence and placing deed restrictions on the property.

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1998. Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing and overseen by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control.

The fifth and sixth Five-Year Reviews, completed in September 2016 and September 2021, determined that the remedy at the Coalinga Asbestos Mine OU and the City of Coalinga OU was functioning as intended and is protective of human health and the environment.
