### Background

The Wilson Farm site is located in Plumsted Township, Ocean County. The site is a 10-acre part of a larger, 218-acre property. Rohm and Haas (the successor to Morton International Inc. and/or Thiokol Chemical Company) allegedly disposed of bulk liquid and drummed wastes on the surface of the site in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The site was allegedly used to dispose of chemical wastes from the Thiokol Corporation during the 1960s and early 1970s. The Ocean County Health Department, Plumsted Township and NJDEP first inspected the site in February 1980. After immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, and site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1984.

After the site’s cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 2009.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Immediate Actions: In July 1980, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) installed and sampled six groundwater monitoring wells. In September 1980, NJDEP excavated and removed sludge, solid wastes and about 620 cubic yards of contaminated soil. NJDEP also established a Well Restriction Area (WRA) in 1986 to further limit human exposure to contaminated groundwater. Between June and July 1992, Morton International Incorporated (MII), the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP), excavated 650 cubic yards of surface waste and contaminated soils and disposed of them at an appropriate off-site disposal facility.

Long-term Cleanup: After site investigations, EPA issued a Risk Assessment Report in May 1993 that  
evaluated residual contaminants in groundwater, surface water, soils and sediments. EPA determined that the contaminants would not affect human health or the environment.

EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in August 1993, documenting that no further cleanup actions would be necessary. After a five-year monitoring program for site groundwater, surface water and sediments to make sure the site did not pose a future threat to the surrounding area, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 2009.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site was addressed in two stages: immediate actions and a long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.

Short term cleanup work excavated and removed sludge and solid wastes and contaminated soils at the Wilson Farm site. Subsequent evaluation of residual contaminants in groundwater, surface water, soils and sediments was conducted. EPA determined that the contaminants would not impact human health or the environment. On August 2, 1993, a Record of Decision (ROD) was signed by EPA requiring that no further cleanup actions would be necessary.

EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 2009.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
