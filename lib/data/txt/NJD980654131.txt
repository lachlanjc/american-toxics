Background
The Dover Municipal Well 4 site in Dover, NJ was one of the town’s main sources of drinking water until 1980, when the town shut it down due to high contaminations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The site includes Dover Municipal Well No. 4 (DMW-4) and three other drinking water production wells that serve a community of about 22,000 people. The Dover Water Commission owns and operates the municipal well field. DMW-4 started pumping in June 1965, after being drilled in 1962. In March 1980, sampling revealed chlorinated VOCs in the groundwater from DMW-4. The Town of Dover then took DMW-4 out of service and switched to standby well No. 3.
EPA traced the source of the contamination to a dry cleaner and determined it needed to be demolished to remove the polluted soil underneath the structure. EPA also chose to treat the groundwater source area with in-situ (in place) process called chemical oxidation while allowing the rest of the groundwater at the site recover naturally. EPA is monitoring the progress of the cleanup regularly.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) assessed the contamination at the site in 1992 and decided the best way to treat the groundwater was to pump it to the surface, treat it, and reinject it into the ground.  The state also began monitoring the groundwater quality and identifying the source(s) of the contamination. In 1992, NJDEP asked EPA to lead the cleanup. EPA found that a dry cleaner on Route 46 was the source of the VOCs in DMW-4. EPA also found that the 1992 cleanup would not work unless the source was removed. EPA finalized a plan in 2005 to address the source of contamination. The plan included demolishing the dry cleaner and three nearby homes, excavating and disposing of the contaminated soil, and injecting chemicals to destroy any remaining groundwater contaminants.
The 2005 plan also revised the original groundwater cleanup to stop the active pumping and treating and allow groundwater to recover naturally. EPA completed the demolition and soil excavation in 2009. EPA started the chemical oxidation process in 2010 and repeated it in 2011, 2012, and 2014. Levels of contamination were reduced and continue to decrease naturally.  The agency is regularly monitoring the groundwater and will treat the groundwater again if contamination levels go back up.﻿

What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA found some soil in one area of the site with high levels of contamination. EPA is removing that soil to reduce the potential for the contamination to move from soil to groundwater. This cleanup work began in early 2024 and is scheduled to be completed in three months. EPA collects groundwater samples from the site monitoring wells on a semi-annual basis. Results are then evaluated to make sure there are not any other sources of contamination and that the natural processes are working. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
There are restrictions on how the groundwater at this site can be used and what can be built on the site. For example, people can’t drill drinking water wells. For more background, see Institutional Controls. Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
EPA currently samples the groundwater semi-annually in the spring and fall. Results of the monitoring are documented in annual Long Term Remedial Action (LTRA) reports, which can be found by reading the five-year review report. Top of Page
