### Background

The Algoma Municipal Landfill is located two miles west of Algoma in the unincorporated township of Ahnapee in Kewanee County. The city of Algoma owns the 13-acre landfill and operated it from 1969-83. In 1970, the landfill received a license from the state to accept municipal refuse. When it closed in 1983, the city covered it with 2 feet of clay and 6 inches of topsoil.

Most of the waste accepted was municipal trash. However, about 210 drums of finishing materials, including polyvinyl acetate, lacquer thinner, methanol, silicate, pigments, and paint primer, were also taken there.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The final cleanup plan to address volatile organic compounds and metals in the groundwater was selected in 1990. A group of six companies and the city of Algoma completed the cleanup in 1993. It included a landfill cover, landfill gas venting system, a fence, and groundwater and landfill gas monitoring.

Long-term protectiveness requires maintenance of the landfill cover and compliance with land-use restrictions that prohibit interference with the cap, restricts future site uses to commercial and industrial uses, and limits groundwater use.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has completed a [five-year review of the Algoma Municipal Landfill site. (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/946764.pdf) (51pp, 8.42MB), [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) (51 pp, 8.42 MB)) The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This was the fifth review of the site.

This review included an evaluation of background information, cleanup requirements, effectiveness of the cleanup, and maintenance and monitoring efforts. It also looked at ways to operate more efficiently.

The review found the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. The next scheduled review will be in 2024.
