### Background

The Maxey Flats Nuclear Disposal [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in Fleming County, Kentucky. The site accepted radioactive waste from 1963 to 1977.

The EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1986 because of contaminated soil, surface water and groundwater resulting from facility operations. The EPA and several [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), including the [Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection (KDEP)](http://dep.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx), have investigated conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination.

Contamination does not threaten people living and working near the site. Residents and businesses now use the public water system for drinking purposes as an additional layer of protection.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Commonwealth of Kentucky and other site PRPs (including the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of Defense) initially led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA. KDEP is conducting ongoing operation and maintenance activities and oversight of the site’s landfill cap.

To address immediate concerns, EPA solidified leachate leaking from metal tanks. EPA disposed of the solidified leachate blocks in an underground on-site trench and installed a temporary, aboveground plastic liner to prevent rain seeping into the site’s waste trenches.

**1991**  
EPA issued the site’s long-term cleanup plan. It included

- digging up landfill disposal trenches to remove wastes and contaminated water
- treating contaminated water on site
- installing and monitoring a landfill cap made of a synthetic liner
- replacing the landfill cap after 20 years
- installing a final landfill cap after 35 to 100 years to allow for the natural stabilization of wastes in the trenches
- operation and maintenance activities such as groundwater and site worker safety monitoring, landfill cover inspections and repairs, and gate and fence inspections.

**1996**  
Site PRPs began the long-term cleanup in 1996, removing radioactive, contaminated leachate from the landfill, and solidifying and disposing of it in reinforced concrete bunkers on site.

**2003**  
The PRPs completed construction of the interim cap, which allows for easier repairs as landfill wastes settle.

**2014**  
After determining that waste settlement was complete, the Commonwealth of Kentucky began work on designing and constructing the final cap at the site in 2014 and 2015.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11070122.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2017. The remedy at MFDS is protective ofhuman health and the environment in the short-term, because remedial activities completed to date have adequately addressed all exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks at MFDS.

Construction of the site’s final cap is complete, and KDEP will take care of operation and maintenance activities at the site. Ground water and surface water monitoring are ongoing.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The final landfill cap has been constructed and a 100-year institutional control period is in progress.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA negotiated legal agreements with site PRPs to investigate and clean up the site. The PRPs continue to fund site cleanup activities, monitoring and oversight costs.
