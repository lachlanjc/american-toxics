### Background

The 280-acre Bailey Waste Disposal site is located in Bridge City, Texas. The site owner constructed two ponds on site in the early 1950s as part of the Bailey Fish Camp. The fish camp operated at the site until 1961, when Hurricane Carla introduced saline waters into the ponds, killing the freshwater fish. Disposal of industrial and municipal waste took place near the ponds until 1971. Waste disposal activities contaminated groundwater, surface water and soil. Following construction of the site’s remedy, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2007. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. Over 156,000 cubic yards of hazardous materials have been addressed to prevent direct contact and off-site migration.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires ongoing maintenance of the caps.

The site is located about three miles southwest of Bridge City in Orange County, Texas. The site was originally part of a tidal marsh near where the Neches River and Sabine Lake join together. About 7,600 people within three miles of the site use wells for drinking water.The site is located about three miles southwest of Bridge City in Orange County, Texas.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The long-term remedy included consolidation of contaminated sediment, in-place stabilization of waste, construction of a cover over the stabilized waste, construction of a wastewater treatment plant and air monitoring. EPA updated the remedy to replace in-place stabilization of waste and placement of a cover over the waste with placement of waste beneath lightweight caps on site and installation of stormwater management controls.

EPA completed the FY 2020 FIve Year Review for the Site. The FYR is a document that determines whether or not a Site is protective of human and environmental health. The FYR dcoument is availalble at the local public repository and on the Site webpage.

Currently EPA has been working on follow-up actions from the FY 2020 Five Year Review and Operations and Maintenance activities at the Site. EPA uploaded a copy of the FY 2021 Bailey Waste Disposal FY 2021 Site Inspection to the Site webpage on Friday June 24, 2022.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Bailey Settler Site Committee performs annual soil sampling and operations and maintenace activitites at the Site. A FY 2020 Operations and Maintenace Report will be generated from the soil sampling event and the other field activites EPA will upload a copy of the report to the Site webpage sometime during fall 2020.
