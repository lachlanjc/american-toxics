### Background

The Spectron, Inc. Superfund Site is located on approximately 8 acres near Elkton, Maryland, in a rural residential area. Solvent recycling operations occupied the site from 1962 to 1988. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were processed and released from the facility, resulting in contaminated soil, groundwater and seeps along the western bank of Little Elk Creek. The site was added to the National Priorities List in March 1994.

EPA and the potentially responsible party (PRP) group continue to plan and implement the cleanup at the site. The Little Elk Creek has been addressed; contaminated sediments were excavated and a stream isolation/groundwater collection and treatment system operates to keep contaminated groundwater from reaching the stream.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

A papermill operated at the site until it was destroyed by fire in 1954. Solvent recycling operations operated at the site from 1962 to 1988, reportedly handling more than 1 million gallons of liquids per year. The solvents included many volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are not very soluble, or able to dissolve, in water. The organic substances are classified as either light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs), less dense than water, or dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs), denser than water. Both LNAPLs and DNAPLs were released into the environment, resulting in contamination to soil and groundwater (overburden and bedrock), as well as DNAPL seeps along the western bank of Little Elk Creek.

The site was abandoned by the owner in 1988, with more than 500,000 gallons of solvents and other liquids left onsite in tanks and drums. These materials were removed by a potentially responsible party (PRP) group in late 1989 and 1990, with oversight by EPA.

Approximately 2,000 cubic yards of affected stream sediments were excavated by the PRP Group from Little Elk Creek in 1998. The Group constructed a stream isolation/groundwater collection and treatment system (SI/GWTS) in 1999 to intercept VOC-bearing groundwater before it can discharge to the stream.

The site was divided into two separate areas or operable units (OUs). OU-1 consists of soil and overburden (shallow) groundwater and OU-2 consists of bedrock (deep) groundwater and Office Area soil.

**OU-1: Soil and Shallow Groundwater**  
The [OU-1 Record of Decision (PDF)](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2011419) (ROD) was issued in 2004, with an [amendment (PDF)](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2141771) in 2012. The remedy includes building demolition, grading of the Plant Area, placement of on-site debris piles under the cap, installation of an asphalt cap (or equivalent), continued operation of the SI/GWTS, in-situ thermal treatment, monitoring to ensure the effectiveness of the remedy, and land and groundwater use restrictions.

The in-situ thermal treatment was started in February 2016 and completed in November 2016 with an estimated 15,700 pounds of VOCs removed.

In March 2019, EPA approved a Remedial Design for the asphalt cap component of the selected remedy for OU-1 at the Spectron site. In March 2020, EPA issued an [Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2296820) modifying the remedy to ensure the continued effectiveness of the stream isolation system.

**OU-2: Deep Groundwater and Office Area Soils**  
An [Interim Record of Decision (ROD) (PDF)](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2159104) was issued in 2012. The interim remedy chosen for OU-2 includes a pre-design investigation, pump and treat in the bedrock groundwater Source Area, Source Area bedrock groundwater monitoring, dissolved bedrock groundwater monitoring, continued operation of the SI/GWTS, residential groundwater well monitoring, excavation of office area soil and placement under OU-1 cap, land and groundwater use restrictions, and vapor intrusion sampling for the five-year review. In March 2020, EPA issued a final [Record of Decision (ROD) (PDF).](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2296819)

Semi-annual residential groundwater well sampling has been ongoing since 1995. Surface water sampling is ongoing. The office area soil excavation was completed in September 2016.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

**OU-1: Soil and Shallow Groundwater**  
In March 2019, EPA approved a Remedial Design for the asphalt cap at the site. The asphalt cap is a component of the selected remedy, to eliminate direct contact with contaminated soil and shallow groundwater. Thermal treatment of the soil, the main component for the OU-1 remedy, was completed in 2016. Construction of the asphalt cap was completed in September 2019.

Consistent with [EPA’s Superfund Redevelopment Initiative](https://www.epa.gov/superfund-redevelopment-initiative), the potentially responsible party (PRP) group is currently evaluating beneficial re-use alternatives for the site, including alternative (solar) energy. The Remedial Design has incorporated elements to promote and enable re-use of the site.

**OU-2: Deep Groundwater and Office Area Soils**  
Ongoing activities include the continued operation of the stream isolation/groundwater collection and treatment system (SI/GWTS), extraction of dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL), residential groundwater well monitoring, vapor intrusion sampling in support of the five-year review, and surface water monitoring. Excavation of the office area soil was completed in 2016.

In March 2020, EPA issued a final [Record of Decison (ROD) (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2296819) to address contaminated deep groundwater (OU-2). The remedy includes continued operation and maintenance of the SI/GWTS; DNAPL collection/extraction and offsite treatment/disposal; groundwater extraction and treatment; groundwater, surface water and residential well monitoring; vapor intrusion monitoring; and land and groundwater use restrictions.

**Five-Year Reveiws**  
EPA ccompleted the [second five-year review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2335692) of the site’s remedy in November 2022. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The remedy is protective in the short-term, additional sampling will need to be performed to ensure the remedy remains protective in the long-term The next five-year review is scheduled for 2027.

**Construction Complete**

Achieved construction complete on September 2020.

**Site Ready For Reuse & Redevelopment**

Achieved site Ready For Reuse and Redevelopment on December 2020.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls (ICs) were selected in the 2004 Operable Unit (OU) 1 Record of Decision (ROD) and the March 2020 OU2 ROD which required a Land Use Control Assurance Plan (LUCAP) be prepared to develop and document the mechanisms for implementing the institutional controls for both OU1 and OU2.

An informational institutional control was put in place by EPA with the Cecil County Health Department in August 2017 to prevent wells being installed in the groundwater plume. The Cecil County Health Department will notify EPA if a permit application is submitted for a new well in the vicinity of the site. EPA will then notify the Cecil County Health Department if the proposed well is likely to be impacted by groundwater contamination from the site and whether the well permit should be approved or disapproved.

The remaining institutional controls are in an Environmental Covenant for the site properties. The Environmental Convenant was signed by EPA, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Potentially Responsible Party Group in December 2020.
