### Background

**Current Status**

The site is currently in operation & maintenance where monitoring of ground water will continue to ensure protectiveness of the EPA cleanup actions.

The [Fifth Five Year Review Report](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/06/100023042.pdf) was completed on March 16, 2021. The remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

**Site Background**

The 5-acre Dutchtown Treatment Plant site is located near Dutchtown in Ascension Parish, Louisiana. An oil refinery and waste oil reclamation facility began operating at the site in the mid-1960s. The facility received waste oil and other waste materials (solvents and petrochemical wastes) from off-site sources and processed and redistributed them. Site activities and waste disposal practices contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1999.

Proposal Date: January 22, 1987  
Final Date: July 22, 1987  
Deletion Proposal Date: September 17, 1999

**Location:** Dutchtown, Ascension Parish, Louisiana. Location at the juncture I-10 and Highway 74.

**Population:** 4,000 people live within three miles of the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  
  
EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

Original site features included a holding pond, waste oil pit, several aboveground storage tanks and a railroad tank car. The State of Louisiana ordered the suspension and proper closure of operations at the site in 1983. In 1984, the state declared the site abandoned.Original site features included a holding pond, waste oil pit, several aboveground storage tanks and a railroad tank car.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included groundwater monitoring; institutional controls; maintenance of the existing cap and fence; closure and replacement of the Watts residential well (later referred to as the Gaudet well); and implementation of contingency measures to address contaminated groundwater if monitoring indicated a 30 percent increase in contaminant concentrations. Remedy construction took place between 1997 and 1998. Groundwater monitoring and site maintenance and inspections are ongoing.  
  
Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1999.

The Fifth Five Year Review Report was completed on March 16, 2021. The summary of the Fifth Five Year Review Report is as follows:

The remedy at the Site is protective of human health and the environment. The existing cap and fencing are maintained, groundwater is monitored every three years, and institutional controls are in place in the form of a conveyance notification. The remedy has met the RAOs of preventing human contact with site soils, preventing human contact with site groundwater, preventing contamination of underlying drinking water aquifer, and restoring groundwater for future use.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions in 1987 addressed a spill that resulted from vandalism to a rail tank car and an oil storage tank. Removal actions in 1991 removed 449,810 gallons of waste oil from the holding pond, waste oil pit and storage tanks; removed and treated 3,451,999 gallons of stormwater from the pits and holding ponds; and installed a French drain. Following the removal actions, compacted caps of imported clay were installed over the backfilled holding pond, the French drain and former storage tank areas.
