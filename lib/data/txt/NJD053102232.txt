Background
The Higgins Disposal site is located on a 37.6-acre parcel on Laurel Avenue in Franklin Township, New Jersey. From the 1950s to 1985, the site owner, Higgins Disposal Services (HDS), operated a waste disposal business including an unpermitted landfill, a waste transfer station and a compactor. The owner’s family currently maintains a residence, an equestrian facility (Hasty Acres Riding Club) and a truck repair shop on the site.
In early 1982, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) discovered that HDS was operating an unregistered waste transfer station and an active, non-permitted landfill on the site property. Following an inspection of the property, NJDEP required that HDS cease all operations of the landfill and remove the solid waste from the property in October 1982. In August 1985, the owner of several residences on Laurel Avenue (Trap Rock Industries) contacted the Franklin Township Health Department (FTHD) and NJDEP because of medicinal tasting tap water. Sampling of residential wells on Laurel Avenue found various volatile organic compounds (VOCs). NJDEP identified HDS as one of the potential source areas. All residences on Laurel Avenue who did not have access to the public water supply were notified by NJDEP or FTHD to use bottled water or install a whole-house point source filter system. After additional investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in August 1990.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In October 1990, EPA performed a removal assessment at the site. As a result, 765 tons of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated soil were excavated and shipped off-site for proper disposal. In the spring of 1993, during the course of remedial investigation activities, EPA discovered drums, plastic and glass containers, and cylinders buried in a field in the southwestern portion of the property. In May 1993, EPA began removal action activities that resulted in the discovery of additional areas of buried waste at the site. The removal action continued through 1996 and resulted in the disposal of over 7,000 containers and 12,000 tons of contaminated soil. Post-excavation sampling revealed the presence of additional waste containers near the previously defined extent of the on-site landfill. In August 1998, the PRP identified by EPA initiated a second removal action under the oversight of EPA’s Removal Program. This removal was completed in July 1999 and resulted in the excavation of approximately 34,000 tons of contaminated material and over 16,000 containers (e.g., laboratory glassware, plastic and metal containers, and drums) from the on-site landfill. In September 1999, the PRP under EPA oversight completed the extension and connection of a potable water supply to the residences along Laurel Avenue and the Higgins residence. From October 1999 to September 2000, the PRP performed a pre-design investigation (PDI) for the final groundwater remedy. The results of this investigation was used to evaluate the impact of the removal actions on the site groundwater as well as provide additional information for the design and implementation of the groundwater remedy. The PDI report was submitted in February 2001. Based on the PDI findings along with the strong public opposition to the construction of a pipeline to the Higgins Farm groundwater treatment plant, and the inaccessibility to certain pipeline areas, the PRP submitted a focused feasibility study (FFS) in June 2001. This FFS concluded that it would be cost-effective and technically practical to pump and treat on-site instead of pumping the contaminated groundwater to the Higgins Farm plant for treatment. The FFS was approved by EPA in September 2002 and was used to modify the remedy selected in the September 1997 ROD. On December 9, 2002, EPA issued an Explanation of Significant Difference (ESD) for the modification of the groundwater remedy. The ESD selected remedy called for on-site groundwater recovery and treatment of contaminated groundwater with treated water reinjection to the aquifer. In January 2004, the PRP initiated pre-design activities which were used to prepare the remedial design. In September 2004, EPA issued a partial Consent Decree for the remedial design/remedial action of the groundwater remedy. A remedial design report submitted by the PRP was approved by EPA in March 2005. This report modified the discharge of treated water from reinjection to surface water discharge. EPA approved the remedial construction work plan prepared by the PRP in April 2005. Construction activities for the groundwater treatment system began in August 2005 with the system fully operational in February 2006. EPA issued a preliminary close-out report (PCOR) in June 2006. An interim remedial action report was submitted by the PRP in August 2006. This report documents all of the construction activities of the groundwater recovery and treatment system. EPA approved of the report in September 2006. The PRP performs long-term response activities including system monitoring and groundwater quality sampling. An initial five year review (FYR) report was issued by EPA on February 15, 2011 and found that the remedy is protective of human health and the environment In November 2011, the PRP submitted a final revised Classification Exception Area (CEA) application for the Site to the NJDEP for review and approval. The CEA is a State requirement that provides protection by preventing the installation of potable wells within the contaminated area. This CEA application was approved by NJDEP in March 2012. An on-site agricultural well used by the horsing riding school was sampled prior to the second FYR and found not to be impacted by the on-site VOC contaminated plume. A second FYR was issued by EPA on May 25, 2016 and determined that the current groundwater conditions shows that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and environment. The PRP long term response continues with monthly system monitoring and semi-annually groundwater sampling. Monthly progress and semi-annual reports are submitted to EPA for review. EPA issued a third five year review for the site in November 2020. The 2020 five-year review determined.that the site-wide remedy is protective of human health and the environment because exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks are being controlled.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site is being addressed in two stages: short-term cleanups, or removal actions, addressing buried waste and contaminated subsurface soil, and a long-term remedial phase focused on contaminated groundwater. Following short-term cleanups to protect human health and the environment, long-term groundwater treatment and monitoring are ongoing. Removal Actions: EPA began conducting removal assessments in 1990. After identifying a public area with elevated surface contaminants, EPA removed the contaminated soil in October 1992. Upon the discovery of buried drums and laboratory glassware, EPA initiated a second removal action at the site in March 1993. Initially, EPA restricted access to the area by installing security fencing and covering the area with tarps and soil and, by April 1994, excavation of the known locations of buried material commenced. During the course of the removal action, EPA was able to identify a potentially responsible party (PRP) for the buried waste materials. In March 1998, EPA successfully negotiated an Administrative Order on Consent (ACO) with the identified PRP to complete the remaining removal activities at the on-site landfill. EPA and the PRP completed this final removal action in June 1999. Entire Site: After addressing buried waste material through removal actions, EPA initiated remedial investigation activities for the contaminated groundwater at the site in the fall of 1992. EPA made available to the public for review and comment the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) Report and proposed plan addressing contaminated groundwater at the site, and presented the findings to the public in May 1997. A Record of Decision (ROD) addressing the contaminated groundwater was issued by EPA on September 30, 1997. The remedy which was selected includes connecting residents down gradient of the site to a public water supply and the extraction of contaminated groundwater, with conveyance via a pipeline to the Higgins Farm Superfund site (located less than a mile away) for treatment and discharge to surface water. After collecting additional information about the site geology and hydrology during the pre-design phase, the PRP submitted a focus Feasibility Study (FFS) report to EPA for modifying the groundwater remedy selected in the ROD. On December 9, 2002, EPA issued an Explanation of Significant Difference (ESD) which changed the remedy from off-site to on-site treatment of the contaminated groundwater. EPA has issued three five year reviews, February 2011, May 2016 and November 2020. Based on the site groundwater conditions at the time, the reviews found that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. Next five year review is due by November 2025 E Vapor Intrusion: EPA initiated a vapor intrusion investigation in March 2006. Several rounds of sub-slab and indoor air samples were collected from residential properties along Laurel Avenue including the Higgins residences. The results indicated that the on-site groundwater plume containing VOCs was not impacting the indoor air at the nearby homes. However, for one residential property owner, where tetrachloroethylene (PCE) was detected beneath the sub-slab at levels above EPA screening criteria, sub-slab and indoor air samples continued to be collected on a regular basis until 2011 when it was determined that VOCs were not impacting this property.
