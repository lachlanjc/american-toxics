### Background

The King of Prussia site is located in Winslow Township, New Jersey. The King of Prussia Technical Corporation treated industrial waste and disposed of hazardous liquids at the 10-acre area from 1970 to 1973. From 1973 to 1975, Evor Phillips, Inc. owned the site and continued operations. In 1975, the site was abandoned. About 15 million gallons of wastewater containing toxic chemicals were delivered to the site. The site was fenced in 1988 to protect public health and prevent further illegal dumping of waste on the site. Following initial cleanup actions, EPA put the site’s long-term remedy in place. Groundwater treatment is ongoing.

The King of Prussia (KOP) Technical Corporation purchased the site property from Winslow Township in 1970. KOP Corporation treated industrial waste and disposed of hazardous liquids on the site. Its operations stopped in 1973. From 1973 to 1975, Evor Phillips, Inc. owned the site and continued operations.

Six lagoons were used to process liquid industrial waste. KOP Corporation’s stated intention was to convert these wastes to materials that would be marketed as construction materials and other uses. However, the company was unable to market these materials and the site soon had more waste than it could process and sell. A minimum of 15 million gallons of acids and alkaline aqueous waste were processed at the facility when KOP Corporation was the operator, with excess materials transported to  
other disposal locations.

KOP Corporation filed for bankruptcy in April 1974. Prior to declaring bankruptcy, the company sold its hauling operation to Evor Phillips, Inc., which subsequently purchased the site property. In 1975, the site was abandoned. Winslow Township regained ownership of the property in 1976, when it foreclosed because of unpaid property taxes. The site had six lagoons, buried drums and plastic containers, and two rusting and torn tankers.

After initial actions to protect human health and the environment, and investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund Program’s National Priorities List in September 1983.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Initial Actions: EPA fenced the site in 1988. In 1989, EPA removed and disposed of 120 buried plastic containers and the associated contaminated liquids and soils. In 1990, EPA removed 200 drums and 235 additional plastic containers. EPA started the removal of two tankers and their contents in early 1991. Disposal of the contents of the drums and tankers finished in late 1991.

Long-term Cleanup: Following a remedial investigation to determine the nature and extent of contamination at the site, EPA selected a site-wide remedy in 1991. It included excavation and treatment of contaminated soils, sediments and sludges by soil washing technology; drum removal and off-site disposal; tanker removal and off-site disposal; installation of a pump-and-treat system for contaminated groundwater; and additional monitoring of the Great Egg Harbor River.

  
The soil washing treatment system operated from June through October 1993. Over 19,000 tons of soil contaminated with heavy metals were successfully treated during its operation. In addition, residually contaminated soils from the drum disposal area were removed from the site early in 1994. Because contaminated soils that posed a risk at the site were already removed from the area, EPA issued a “no action” Record of Decision (ROD) for the drum disposal area in September 1995. The ground-water treatment system started operating in March 1995. Groundwater treatment is ongoing.

  
EPA has conducted several five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents.  
  
The reviews concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

This site is being addressed in two stages: initial actions and a long-term remedial phase focusing on cleanup of the entire site. Response Action Status

Initial Actions: EPA fenced the site in 1988, and in 1989, removed and disposed of 120 buried plastic containers and the associated contaminated liquids and soils. In 1990, EPA removed 200 drums and 235 additional plastic containers. EPA initiated the removal of two tankers and their contents in early 1991. Disposal of the contents of the drums and tankers was completed in late 1991. Entire Site: The parties potentially responsible for site contamination completed a study to determine the nature and extent of contamination at the site in 1990. EPA reviewed the study and selected a remedy which included: excavation and treatment of contaminated soils, sediments and sludges by soil washing technology; drum removal and off-site disposal; tanker removal and off-site disposal; installation of a pump and treat system for contaminated groundwater; and additional monitoring of the Great Egg Harbor River. The design phase, which included additional sampling of contaminated areas, began in December 1991, and was completed in 1994 with the design of the ground-water treatment system. The soil washing treatment system was constructed in 1993. Operation of this system lasted from June through October 1993. Over 19,000 tons of soil contaminated with heavy metals were successfully treated during its operation. In addition, residually contaminated soils from the drum disposal area were removed from the site early in 1994. As the contaminated soils that posed a risk at the site were already removed from the area, a no action ROD was issued for the drum disposal area in September 1995.

The ground-water treatment system was constructed in late 1994. Initial start-up of the system began in March 1995. A five-year review of the remedy was completed in September 2000. The five-year review determined that the remedy for this site remains protective of human health and the environment. A second five-year review was completed in September 2005. The second five-year review determined that the remedies for the site remain protective of human health and the environment. In addition, the second five-year review required that the potentially responsible parties conduct a comprehensive groundwater sampling event and other investigations at the site. The data from this event was intended to be used by EPA to determine what measures should be taken to optimize the ongoing groundwater extraction, treatment and reinjection system. These investigations were completed in late 2006. A review of the data indicates that proper quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures were not implemented during the investigation. As a result, EPA could not use the data to determine how to best optimize the groundwater extraction and treatment system. In 2009, EPA requested that the PRPs conduct another comprehensive groundwater sampling event and to insure that proper QA/QC procedures are implemented during the sampling event. The data from that event was used to update operation and maintenance proceedures and develop optimization recommendations to enhance the remedy effectiveness.

Site Facts: Five waste generators entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with EPA in 1985 to conduct a site investigation. In 1991, EPA issued an order to five potentially responsible parties to design and conduct cleanup activities at the site. The extraction, treatment, and reinjection system was completed in 1994. The system began treating contaminated water in early 1995. The treatment plant operated until May 2019. The treatment plant is temporarily shut down since the groundwater quality has improved to the point where the plant may not be required, The responsible party will monitor the groundwater and if any unacceptable concentrations are detected will take the appropriate action including restarting the treatment plan if required. a
