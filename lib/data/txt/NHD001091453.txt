### Background

The 13-acre New Hampshire Plating Co. site is located in Merrimack, New Hampshire. An electroplating facility operated on site from 1962 to 1985. Wastewater containing metals, solvents and cyanide used in the electroplating operations was discharged into drainage channels in the former building floor and flowed into unlined lagoons north of the building. Contaminants from the unlined lagoons affected on-site wetlands, contaminated surface and subsurface soils, and reached the groundwater. Following source area cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

Cleanup activities by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) in 1987 included treatment of the lagoon system with lime and a sodium hypochlorite solution, removal of debris, drums and plating tank liquids, and a superficial cleaning of the company’s building. From 1990 to 1991, EPA removed, solidified and consolidated sludges and soils from the four lagoons. Fencing was installed to further secure and restrict access to the site. In 1994, the NH Plating Co. building was decontaminated, demolished and removed. An underground storage tank was also removed. Sampling was done under the former building and a temporary cap was installed to prevent the possible spread of contaminated soils.

In 1992, EPA began investigating the nature and extent of contamination at the site. The investigation was completed in the summer of 1996. EPA issued a proposed cleanup plan in January 1998 and a Record of Decision Record of Decision describing those plans, signed in September 1998, specified treatment of contaminated soils through an innovative process referred to as chemical fixation. Cleanup actions began in November 2004 and soil cleanup activities were completed in December 2006. Natural attenuation was selected as the groundwater remedy.

The Grassy Pond wetland in Litchfield, NH was acquired in 1998 to partially compensate for lost wetlands on site. The Green's Pond wetland area in Merrimack, NH was also acquired in 2002, completing all necessary wetland compensation activities associated with the eventual cleanup of the site.

Following the 2014 five-year review for the site, it was determined that the natural attenuation remedy was not performing as expected due to the presence of a residual source of tetrachloroethylene.  A Supplemental Remedial Investigation was conducted from 2015 to 2018. In September 2020, EPA issued an Explanation of Significant Differences, which modified the remedial action objectives in the 1998 Record of Decision to further define the remedy’s requirements to protect human health due to vapor intrusion, incorporated new vapor intrusion mitigation and institutional control requirements, required the continued operation of the vapor mitigation system at the Acme property, and updated applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements and TCBs to incorporate additional promulgated state and federal standards and guidance.

In August 2023, through a [ROD Amendment](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/676605) (Interim Remedy), EPA modified the groundwater remedy it previously selected in a [Record of Decision](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/41303) in 1998 and modified in subsequent Explanations of Significant Differences in 2007 and 2020. The Interim Remedy includes treatment and sequestration of groundwater contaminants by in-situ (in-place) activated carbon injections and phytoremediation. Groundwater will be monitored to evaluate the performance of the Interim Remedy. EPA will select a final cleanup remedy once it determines the timeframe for cleanup or whether cleanup levels can be met.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Full-scale remedial construction activities began in the summer of 2005. They included the excavation of all remaining contaminated soils and sludge from the site, treatment of contaminated soils through chemical fixation, backfilling treated soils on site, regrading excavated areas, and the construction of a 2-foot soil cover system over the backfilled treated soils. These activities finished in December 2006.

With the completion of soil cleanup activities, EPA expected that contaminant levels in groundwater would naturally attenuate to safe drinking water levels in 26 to 58 years. However, following the 2014 five-year review for the Site, it was determined that the natural attenuation remedy was not performing as expected due to the presence of a residual source of tetrachloroethylene.  A Supplemental Remedial Investigation was conducted between 2015 and 2018 to evaluate the effectiveness of the natural attenuation remedy for Site groundwater in terms of managing migration beyond the NHPC parcels and reducing contaminants to drinking water standards within a reasonable time frame. During the supplemental remedial investigation, higher than previously observed concentrations of tetrachlorethylene were detected in groundwater and were attributed to back-diffusion from a less permeable lacustrine unit to which the tetrachloroethylene is sorbed. The supplement remedial investigation report concluded that natural attenuation alone has not sufficiently decreased contaminant migration.

In August 2023, EPA issued a [Record of Decision Amendment](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/676605) (Interim Remedy), which modified the groundwater remedy it previously selected in a [Record of Decision (ROD)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/41303) in 1998 and modified in subsequent Explanations of Significant Differences (ESD) in 2007 and 2020. EPA is currently conducting pre-design investigation activities. EPA anticipates having a remedial design for the in-situ activated carbon injections and phytoremediation completed by June 2025.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**  
  
This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.  
  
The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.

### Emergency Response and Removal

The supplemental remedial investigation identified the presence of COCs, including, but not limited to, high levels of TCE in groundwater at the Acme Pressure Washing property, posing a potential vapor intrusion concern. The Acme property was owned by NHPC from about 1961 until February 1965, at which time the property was sold to an unrelated party for concrete mix operations, and later to the owner of Acme Pressure Washing. In September 2019, EPA completed a removal action to address vapor intrusion risk through the installation of a sub-slab depressurization system in the Acme Pressure Washing building and made stormwater management improvements to protect the long-term operation of the mitigation system.
