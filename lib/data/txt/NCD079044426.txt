### Background

The 141-acre General Electric Co/Shepherd Farm [Superfund site](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) is located in East Flat Rock, Henderson County North Carolina. The site includes two separate disposal areas. The 110-acre GE Lighting Systems facility area is located at the southeastern corner of Spartanburg Highway (U.S. Highway 176) and Tabor Road. The 31-acre Shepherd Farm area is located on Roper Road, 1,200 feet west of Spartanburg Highway and southwest of the GE Lighting Systems facility. The Shepherd Farm area includes 125 manufactured homes, a residence and agricultural land. Residential areas, commercial businesses and agricultural land surround the site.

The GE Lighting Systems Hendersonville facility has operated since 1955. GE manufactured several types of luminaire systems at the facility, some of which included transformers. From 1957 to 1970, wastes were disposed on site and in a dry pond on the Shepherd Farm area. The facility was purchased on April 1, 2019 by American Industrial Partners. GE retains ownership of the property and retains all remedial obligations under the 1996 Consent Decree between the EPA and the General Electric Company. The new owner continues to operate the manufacturing plant with no changes in operations or land use on-site. The site includes the active manufacturing facility, a warehouse, eight plots formerly used for waste disposal, two unlined waste treatment ponds, a sludge impoundment, two former landfills and a recreation center.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1994 because of contaminated groundwater and soil resulting from waste handling practices. EPA, the [North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (NCDENR)](https://deq.nc.gov/), and GE, the site’s [potentially responsible party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), have investigated site conditions.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. The PRP extended a water line to connect some residences to the public water supply. By treating groundwater and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, NCDENR and the site’s PRP continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

GE, the site’s PRP, leads site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and NCDENR.

**1995**  
EPA issued the cleanup plan for the site. To address groundwater, the plan includes:

- a pump-and-treat system along with air stripping, carbon absorption and bacteria for bioremediation, to break down contamination in groundwater;
- treated groundwater is discharged to Bat Fork Creek; and,
- groundwater and surface water are monitored.

To address soil, the plan includes:

- digging up contaminated soil at the Shepherd Farm area and disposing of the soil in the dry sludge impoundment area at the GE Lighting Systems facility area;
- backfilling dug-up areas with clean soil;
- grading and revegetating the backfilled areas;
- placing a multi-layer cap over areas of soil contamination in the GE Lighting Systems facility area;
- maintaining the capped area; and,
- placing institutional controls on the site property to limit use of the capped areas.
**1997 – 2000**
- The site’s PRP removed all underground storage tanks, contaminated soil and a ruptured drain line from the site.
- The PRP extended a water line to connect some residences to the public water supply and provide other residences with bottled water.
- The PRP removed contaminated soil from the Shepherd Farm area
- The PRP removed contaminated soil from the GE Lighting Systems facility area and completed capping activities.
- The PRP completed construction of the pump-and-treat system and began operations.
- EPA updated the cleanup plan to remove the use of bioremediation as part of groundwater cleanup activities and to change the discharge location for treated groundwater to the GE facility.

**2021**

- EPA issued an Explanation of Significant Differences which added institutional controls to the site cleanup plan as recommended by the 2019 Five Year Review to ensure long term protectiveness. Institutional controls in the form of land use restrictions will protect the integrity of the cap and to restrict ground water use.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11134198) was completed by EPA on September 30, 2024. The conclusion of the review was that the remedy remained protective of human health and the environment because there were no completed exposure pathways. To ensure long-term protectiveness, EPA issued an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) in 2021 adding adding institutional controls to the site remedy. The institutional controls will formalize measures to protect the integrity of the cap and to restrict ground water use. EPA is working with NCDEQ and the site PRP to implement the land use restrictions.

Groundwater treatment and operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRP to investigate and clean up the site. The PRP continues to fund site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
