### Background

The Palmetto Recycling, Inc. Site is located in Columbia, South Carolina. It includes an area where Palmetto Recycling, Inc. operated a lead battery reclamation facility from 1979 to 1983. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the Site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1987 because of contaminated soil resulting from facility operations. The EPA, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC), and the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. In 2000, the EPA took the site off the NPL after determining that the site no longer poses a threat to people or the environment.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The 1.5-acre site is located approximately eight miles north of Columbia in Richland County, South Carolina. An unnamed tributary of Dry Fork Creek borders the site to the north. Koon Store Road (State Road S-40-61) borders the Site to the south. An unnamed dirt road and Dry Fork Creek border the site to the east. A residence borders the site to the west. A paintball area is located west of the site. Several residences are located southwest and southeast of the Site. From 1979 until 1983, Palmetto Recycling Inc. operated a lead battery reclamation facility at the site. Operations placed wastes in an unlined pit and drums. Operations also left unstabilized battery casings in a pile on site. In 1983, Palmetto Recycling Inc. filed for bankruptcy. In 1987, the EPA listed the site on the NPL. Following cleanup activities, the EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 2000. Currently, the Site is not in use. The Site can support residential land uses.

- The Site’s PRP led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by the EPA and SCDHEC.
- In 1984, the EPA and SCDHEC collected 10,800 gallons of contaminated water and transported it off Site. The agencies also removed 100 drums containing liquid waste.
- In 1985 and 1986, the EPA and SCDHEC removed 365 tons of soil and disposed of it at off-site landfills.
- In 1999, the Site’s PRP completed cleanup activities, including removal of an additional 947 cubic yards of contaminated material.
- In 2000, the EPA took the site off the NPL after determining that no contamination remained on Site above health-based levels that prevent unlimited use and unrestricted exposure.
- The Five-Year Review for the Site, completed in 2004, found that the cleanup remains protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1995, the EPA issued a cleanup plan (a Record of Decision, or ROD) for the Site. The plan included digging up and disposing of contaminated soil; backfilling and landscaping the dug-up area; monitoring groundwater annually for a minimum of five years; and additional soil sampling in residential yards next to the site and the dirt road that borders the site to the east to identify potential soil contamination off Site.

In 2000, the EPA took the site off the NPL after determining that the Site no longer poses a threat to people or the environment.

***The EPA does not require any additional cleanup activities or Five-Year Reviews for the Site.***

### Enforcement Information

In 1992, the EPA negotiated legal agreements with the Site’s PRPs to fund site investigations. The EPA did not reach an agreement with the PRPs. Therefore, the EPA used federal funds for site investigation activities. In 1997, the EPA negotiated legal agreements with one PRP to conduct site cleanup activities.
