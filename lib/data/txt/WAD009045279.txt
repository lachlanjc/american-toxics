### Background

The 300-acre Alcoa (Vancouver Smelter) site is located next to the Columbia River in Vancouver, Washington. The former Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) operated an aluminum smelter on the western portion of the site between 1940 and 1985. From 1973 until 1981, operators dumped about 66,000 tons of potliner containing cyanide and fluoride outside the smelter on the ground. Potliner is a special lining material used to protect steel pots. Site activities also included the storage and disposal of other industrial and solid wastes from construction and operation of the smelter in waste piles and on-site landfills. These activities contaminated the soil and ground water with cyanide, fluoride and alumina. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1996.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Alcoa Vancouver site is located in Clark County on the north bank of the Columbia River approximately three miles northwest of downtown Vancouver, Washington. Alcoa constructed an aluminum smelter on the western portion of the site in 1940. Between 1944 and 1970, a number of fabrication operations were added to the facility to form aluminum into finished goods such as wire, rod, and extrusions. Alcoa operated the entire facility for approximately 45 years, until its closure in 1985. In 1985, Alcoa sold the aluminum smelter to VANALCO, who operated it until 2000 when it closed. Evergreen Aluminum (Glencore) purchased the smelter assets in 2002, but did not restart the plant. While Alcoa sold or discontinued all operations and divested much of the smelter property, the company retained ownership of certain parcels, including the dock and alumina unloading facilities. Industrial and solid wastes from construction and operation of the aluminum smelter were stored in waste piles and consolidated in landfills onsite over the years. Hazardous contaminants in these wastes include petroleum hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), cyanide, fluoride, trichloroethylene (TCE), low-level organic chemicals, and metals. Evergreen began closure and demolition of the smelter in 2007. At the same time, Alcoa began final cleanup of the rest of the site. In December 2008, Alcoa and Ecology agreed on a Cleanup Action Plan and Consent Decree for the upland cleanup and remediation of PCB-contaminated sediments in the Columbia River. The Consent Decree did not cover cleanup of the contaminated groundwater beneath the East Landfill. Alcoa completed dredging PCB-contaminated sediments from the Columbia River at the end of January 2009. Smelter demolition and final removal of contaminated soils from the site was completed in March 2010. The Port of Vancouver purchased the site from Evergreen and Alcoa in 2009 and is redeveloping the area into a bulk storage and transport terminal.

The site was addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included excavating and disposing of 50,000 tons of spent potliners and reclaimed alumina; covering contaminated soils under the former potliner piles; regrading soil, fencing the facility, monitoring ground water and surface water; and institutional controls. Remedy construction took place between 1992 and 1996. No further cleanup actions are required at the site.

EPA placed the site on the NPL in 1990. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1996.
