### Background

The Peninsula Boulevard Groundwater Plume Superfund site includes the area within and around a groundwater plume, which is an area where contaminants disperse, in the Village of Hewlett, Town of Hempstead, Nassau County, New York.

The source of this contamination is thought to be several dry cleaners, including the former Grove Cleaners, located at 1274 Peninsula Boulevard, which disposed hazardous substances, including [tetrachloroethylene](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts18.pdf) (PCE), [trichloroethylene](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts19.pdf) (TCE) and other [volatile organic compounds](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/technical-overview-volatile-organic-compounds) into on-site dry wells from 1987 to 1992. In March 1991, the Nassau County Department of Health (NCDH) cited Grove Cleaners for discharging hazardous waste. NCDH found PCE in soil and sludge samples collected at the Grove Cleaners site and near the property. New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) found that there were areas other than the Grove Cleaners site that were potentially contaminating the groundwater and shared the information EPA. The EPA added the site to the Superfund programâ€™s National Priorities List (NPL) in July 2004.

The New York American Water Company (NYAWC) provides clean drinking water to the residences in the area. The NYAWC operates a well field approximately 1,000 feet north of the site. The NYAWC treats groundwater pumped from this well field by forcing air through the polluted groundwater to remove harmful chemicals, a process called air stripping.

EPA is addressing the site in two phases called operable units (OUs). The first OU is the area of contaminated groundwater extending from the intersection of Peninsula Boulevard and West Broadway in Hewlett, New York, to the north-northwest toward Motts Creek. The second OU is the source areas of the groundwater contamination and consists of two Areas of Concern (AOCs).

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA is cleaning up the groundwater contamination at the site in two phases or operable units (OUs). EPA is cleaning up the groundwater contamination in the deeper portions of the plume under OU1. EPA is also cleaning up the groundwater closest to the source (AOC 1), along West Broadway between Hamilton Avenue and Hewlett Parkway, under OU2. This is also helping prevent further spread of the contamination.

As part of the investigation of groundwater further from the source, EPA tested residential homes to determine whether they were potentially impacted by vapors released from the groundwater plume. Three residences had installed a sub-slab depressurization systems, which is a fan or blower that draws air from the soil beneath a building and discharges it to the atmosphere through a series of pipes, at this residence. EPA documented its plan to clean up OU1 in a [Record of Decision](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/111924.pdf) (ROD) in September 2011. Under this plan EPA will extract and treat the groundwater using bioremediation, which is the process of using either naturally occurring or deliberately introduced microorganisms or other forms of life to consume and break down the contamination. EPA completed the [engineering design for the OU1 cleanup](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/02/642183) in 2016.

EPA contractors finalized a pre-design investigation report in June 2022 summarizing the results of the soil and groundwater data collected in 2021. The sampling results showed that groundwater contamination near the Cedarwood Cleaners is more widespread than initially estimated in 2017. In July 2024, the EPA transferred the responsibility from an EPA fund-lead response action to state-lead O&M of two Sub-Slab Depressurizations Systems for the Peninsula Boulevard Groundwater Plume Superfund site. In February 2024, the EPA secured the services of an engineering firm to prepare the detailed engineering plan for the cleanup of the areas considered to be the sources of the contamination at the site. This activity is estimated to take up to three years to complete due to the need to collect additional groundwater samples at AOC 1 and to perform a pilot study at AOC 2.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Treatment of the groundwater in the areas further from the source of contamination, known as OU1, will be implemented after the OU2 cleanup is in place. EPA is developing the engineering design to cleanup groundwater contamination nearest the source of contamination, also known as OU2, using natural elements and heat to break up the contamination in place. A ROD was issued in 2011 for the cleanup of the deeper contaminated groundwater at the site, selecting groundwater pump and treat as the cleanup remedy. EPA started the RD for the OU1 selected remedy in January 2011, and was completed in September 2016. Construction of the OU1 remedy has not yet begun.

From September 2020 through July 2021, EPA contractors conducted pre-design sampling and analysis for the OU2 selected remedy. In February 2024, EPA acquired the services of a contractor through the US Army Corps of Engineers to design the cleanup plan. The Remedial Design is expected to take up to three years to complete.
