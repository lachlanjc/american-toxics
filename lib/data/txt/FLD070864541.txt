### Background

The Tri-City Oil Conservationist, Incorporated site is located in Temple Terrace, Florida. It includes the area where a heating oil business operated from 1960 to 1975, and where a waste oil storage and distribution facility operated from 1978 to 1983. EPA placed the site on the Superfund programâ€™s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1984 because of contaminated soil and groundwater resulting from an oil spill at the site. EPA and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. By cleaning up the site, EPA and FDEP have protected people and the environment from site contamination.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The quarter-acre site is located near the intersection of North 50th Street and East Busch Boulevard in Temple Terrace, Florida, northeast of Tampa. The site includes several buildings and paved areas. Commercial and residential land uses surround the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

- In 1987, EPA issued the cleanup plan (a Record of Decision, or ROD) for the site. It stated that no further action was necessary because cleanup activities had addressed site contamination.
