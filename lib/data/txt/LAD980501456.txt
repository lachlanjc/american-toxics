### Background

**Current Status**

The fifth Five Year Review was completed on May 21, 2018. The next Five Year Review is planned for 2023. Post closure monitoring continues on an annual basis. A notice was placed in the property records alerting that portions of the site have been used for waste disposal activities. A site inspection was conducted on August 14, 2017 as part of the Five Year review that was completed in May 2018..

**Site Background**

The 25-acre Cleve Reber site is located in Sorrento, Louisiana. During the construction of Highway 70 and the Sunshine Bridge, the site served as a borrow pit for fill material. Following completion of the highway and bridge, the Environmental Controls Company (ECCO) leased the property in 1970. A disposal area for municipal waste that also accepted industrial waste from chemical plants in the Ascension Parish area operated on site. A Louisiana court determined that operations violated the state’s sanitary code and ECCO abandoned the site in 1974. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil and groundwater. Following cleanup, post-closure monitoring of the landfill is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. Implementation of the selected source control remedy permanently treated waste on site. Capping eliminates human exposures to waste and protects the health of nearby residents.  
  
EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

The site is located about one mile south of Highway 22, on the east side of Highway 70. Swampy areas are located next to the site to the east and south. Areas to the north and west are primarily agricultural and residential. Residential areas are scarcely populated. The nearest residence is located immediately north of the site, and about 10 additional residential properties are located further to the north. The town of Sorrento has a population of about 1,000, and about 155 people live within a mile of the site.The site is located about one mile south of Highway 22, on the east side of Highway 70.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included draining and backfilling ponds; excavating, backfilling and capping the landfill; clearing dense vegetation; putting in an elevated flood berm; and fencing the site.  

### Sampling and Monitoring

Monitoring of the groundwater is conducted by the PRPs in accordance to the approved Operation and Maintenance (O&M) plans.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions in 1983 removed more than 1,100 drums and numerous waste piles and placed a temporary clay cap over the area to prevent infiltration.
