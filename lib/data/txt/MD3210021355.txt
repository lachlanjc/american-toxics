### Background

Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) Michaelsville Landfill Site is a 17,000 acre military testing site, established in 1918 and is located in Aberdeen, Maryland. It includes firing ranges, impact areas, vehicle test tracks, a fire training area, and laboratories in support of the testing activities. These past activities have resulted in in contamination of soil, sediment, and ground water with hazardous chemicals in the vicinity of the 20-acre Michaelsville Landfill. The landfill is an unlined mixed waste landfill that operated from roughly 1970 to 1980, receiving wastes from various sources at APG. The site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in October 1989.

The U.S Army as the lead agency, is responsible for conducting investigations and cleanups at the facility, with EPA oversight and participation with Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), as part of the Federal Facility Agreement.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The U.S. Army entered into a Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) in March of 1990 with the EPA. As the lead agency, the U.S. Army is responsible for conducting investigations and cleanups at the facility with EPA oversight and participation with MDE. The FFA identified specific study areas within the Michaelsville Area which included the Michaelsville Landfill, Phillips Field Disposal Area, White Phosphorus Burial Sites, and other Aberdeen Areas. These areas are further divided into operable units for remedy selection/implementation. It also provided the framework and a schedule to accomplish this work. Currently, there are 16 operable units being addressed under the Superfund program.

The EPA has signed Records of Decision (RODs) selecting remedies for twelve operable units.

A full list of operable units can be viewed under the *Operable Units* section.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Cleanup work is ongoing at several operable units. Current work at APG Michaelsville includes Michaelsville Landfill Source, Michaelsville Landfill Groundwater, Western Boundary Area Groundwater, Six Groundwater Sites, Five Sediment Sites, Pistol and Rifle Range, Known Distance Range and 23 Other Sites, Woodrest Creek and Swan Creek Dumps, and Shell Washout Area Building 700B.

The U.S. Army, with EPA concurrence, has conducted multiple five-year reviews of the site’s remedies. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent [2019 Five-Year Review report (PDF)](http://semspub.epa.gov/work/03/2292942.pdf) concluded that the remedies are protective, with the exception of the Western Boundary Study Area Groundwater. Protectiveness was deferred here due to the ongoing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) investigation. The next five-year review is scheduled for June 2024.

For more detailed information on the operable units and clean-up activities, see the current [Five-Year Review and Addendums](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0300423&doc=Y&colid=70093&region=03&type=SC).

There are currently 15 operable units under investigation which may require a remedy at the site.

The U.S. Army has the lead role for cleaning up the Michaelsville Landfill and APG Installation Policies can be viewed online at [https://home.army.mil/apg/about/installation-policies](https://home.army.mil/apg/about/installation-policies).

A full list of activities for each operable unit can be found under the *Cleanup Progress* section.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

At APG, land use controls are in place at several operable units either through the formal CERCLA process or through a Post Record of Decision action. For a detailed description of the land use controls at each operable unit please see Section 1.5.1 of the [2019 Fourth Five-Year Review Report (PDF).](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2292942)
