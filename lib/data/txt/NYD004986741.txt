Background
The Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics site is in Hoosick Falls, New York. The Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics facility continues to operate at 14 McCaffrey Street. The McCaffrey Street facility, built in 1961, manufactured circuit board laminates, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-coated fiberglass and other PTFE products. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics purchased the facility in 1999 and began manufacturing operations that used perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Groundwater at the Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics facility is contaminated with PFOA and trichloroethylene (TCE). PFOA belongs to a group of chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) used to make household and commercial products. This class of chemicals resists heat and chemical reactions and repels oil, stains, grease, and water. PFOA does not break down easily and can negatively affect human health and the environment. PFOA was widely used in non-stick pots and pans, stain-resistant carpets and water-resistant outerwear. EPA reached a nationwide agreement in 2006 with eight manufacturers to phase out the production and use of PFOA. These manufacturers stopped using PFOA in 2015. The most-studied PFAS chemicals are PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS). Studies show that PFOA and PFOS can cause reproductive, developmental, liver, kidney, and immunological effects in laboratory animals. TCE is a volatile organic compound widely used as an industrial solvent. Exposure to TCE can have negative health impacts, including liver damage and increased risk of cancer. In 2015, drinking water in the Hoosick Falls community was found to contain PFOA and community members contacted EPA with concerns and questions about whether they should drink, bathe in, or cook with their water. EPA recommended in November 2015 that people not drink the water from the Hoosick Falls public water supply or use it for cooking. EPA found the village of Hoosick Falls public drinking water supply contained PFOA above EPA’s then 400 parts per trillion (ppt) health advisory. EPA subsequently released Drinking Water Health Advisories in 2016 for PFOA and PFOS. At that time, EPA lowered the PFOA advisory level to 70 parts per trillion (ppt) from the original level of 400 ppt. EPA issued interim updated health advisories for PFOA and PFOS in June 2022 in light of new scientific information on these chemicals’ health effects. These interim health advisories will be in place until EPA’s forthcoming PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation is in effect. EPA's proposed National Primary Drinking Water Regulation for PFOA and PFOS will be released in the fall of 2022. EPA has worked closely with New York State as it has taken many steps to address the drinking water, provide health information to residents and address multiple potential sources of the PFOA in the area. To address one of the courses of PFOA in Hoosick Falls drinking water, EPA added the Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics site to the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) in July 2017. The NPL is an EPA list of U.S. sites in most need of long-term cleanup. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) leads the investigation and cleanup of the McCaffrey Street site with close support from EPA. NYSDEC entered into a series of Consent Orders and oversees work to address the efforts at the NPL site. NYSDEC also oversees several other sites in the area. These include the Saint-Gobain Liberty Street site, Oak Materials (River Road) site, Former Oak Materials (John Street) site, Hoosick Falls Landfill, the Allied-Signal Laminate Systems - Mechanic Street site and Former Oak-Mitsui - First Street site. For additional information about the status of NYSDEC's investigations and for the appropriate New York State contacts, visit the NYSDEC webpage Information for Communities Impacted by Perfluorinated Compounds (PFCs). The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) is the lead for addressing PFOA contamination in the water supply. EPA announced in June 2022 that it is inviting states and territories to apply for $1 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law grant funding to address PFAS and other emerging contaminants in drinking water.
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) entered into a Consent Order in June 2016 with potentially responsible parties (PRPs) Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics and Honeywell International. PRPs are parties EPA determines may be legally responsible for a Superfund site’s contamination. Honeywell International is liable because of prior operations at the facility. The state’s legal agreement requires the companies to perform a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) at the McCaffrey Street site. The RI/FS will determine the nature and extent of the contamination and identify and evaluate cleanup alternatives.  The main contaminant of concern at the McCaffrey Street site is PFOA in the soil and groundwater. Work to date includes collecting samples from soil, groundwater, and surface water.  Under the legal agreement with the state, the PRPs also undertook an Interim Remedial Measure (IRM) to address the PFOA contamination impacting the village’s municipal water supply. PRPs installed a granulated activated carbon (GAC) filtration system on the village of Hoosick Falls water supply wells to treat the water in 2016. The state also discovered PFOA  in private wells. The state installed individual treatment systems called point-of-entry treatment systems (POET) on more than 800 private drinking water wells. POETs treat all water entering a building, reducing contaminants for safe drinking. The Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics contractor and Honeywell constructed a groundwater interceptor trench in 2019 as an IRM at the McCaffrey Street facility. The trench collects and treats contaminated groundwater before it leaves the property to prevent it from spreading to the nearby municipal water supply wells. The treated groundwater is discharged under an NYSDEC permit to the Hoosick River. In March 2019, EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) did sophisticated sampling of the stacks at the McCaffrey Street facility to identify the specific PFAS and PTFE products in air emissions. EPA’s ORD concluded that PFOA was not present in the emissions and no other longchain legacy perfluorinated carboxylic acids were found. EPA completed the final report on emissions in December 2019. The report and an NYSDEC Summary Memorandum are available from NYSDEC. For additional information about the status of NYSDEC's investigations and for the appropriate New York state contacts, visit the NYSDEC webpage Information for Communities Impacted by Perfluorinated Compounds (PFCs).

What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA is working collaboratively with the New York State Department of Conservation (NYSDEC) as they lead the investigation and cleanup of the Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics NPL site at McCaffrey Street and several other state-designated contaminated sites in Hoosick Falls.  A comprehensive investigation into the extent and nature of the contamination as well as a study of feasible cleanup options, called a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study or RI/FS, is underway for the McCaffrey Street site. EPA anticipates that a cleanup plan will be proposed for public comment in 2023. The public water supply is now treated to remove PFOA from the water that residents drink and use. The state has also installed point-of-entry treatment systems (POETS) on any private wells that were tested and showed elevated levels of PFOA. They continue to maintain these systems for homeowners.
Under the Consent Order with the state, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics and Honeywell International prepared a study to evaluate alternate water supply options for the village municipal water supply in 2019. NYSDEC gave the public the opportunity to review and comment on the study and based on the results NYSDEC released a Proposed Remedial Action Plan on April 21, 2021. The plan calls for a new groundwater source from the LaCroix and Wysocki wells, with a granulated activated carbon (GAC) water filtration system. The comment period ended on June 24, 2021. It’s anticipated that NYSDEC will make a final decision in late summer 2021.

Sampling and Monitoring
EPA installed monitoring wells in April and May 2016 to sample groundwater at and around the Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics facility. EPA also sampled the village water supply wells and soil from the McCaffrey Street facility, village ballfields and recreational areas. Additional information about the sampling is available in a series of 2016 Community Update fact sheets. NYSDEC performed additional soil, groundwater, surface water, and sediment sampling in the broader Hoosick Falls area in 2016. The entities responsible for the cleanup, called Potentially Responsible Parties or PRPs, continue to investigate potential contamination under NYSDEC oversight. Members of the public expressed concern about the potential risks posed by other PFOA-replacement chemicals, such as GenX. The state and Saint-Gobain coordinated with EPA to look for the presence of PFOA-replacement and other PFAS substances in the public water supply and groundwater near the site. Water samples from the raw (untreated) water intake, the midpoint between the two granulated activated carbon units, and the finished (treated) water from the Hoosick Falls municipal water treatment plant were collected in January 2018. The samples were analyzed for GenX and a suite of 21 per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The state and Saint-Gobain collected groundwater samples from four monitoring wells at and near the McCaffrey Street facility for analysis. They did not detect GenX in any of the samples.  While some PFAS was detected in the monitoring well samples and in the raw water samples at the water treatment plant, those compounds were not detected in the finished water at the water treatment plant.  EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) also tested the air in the stacks at the McCaffrey Street facility in March 2019. The stack sampling identified the specific PFAS and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) products in emissions released into the air from the facility. ORD concluded that PFOA was not present in the emissions and found no other longchain legacy perfluorinated carboxylic acids. ORD completed the final report in December 2019.
