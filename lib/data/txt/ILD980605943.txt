### Background

The 50-acre Woodstock Municipal Landfill site is located in Woodstock, Illinois. It was a local dump and open burning area from 1935 to 1958, when the City of Woodstock purchased the property and began to bury municipal waste in on-site trenches. The site also accepted industrial waste for disposal. The landfill closed in 1975. EPA inspected the site in 1985 and observed leachate seeping out of the wastes. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and wetlands restoration are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions under state and federal oversight.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the siteâ€™s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The site is currently in the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase to monitor the integrity of the landfill cap and the quality of any leachate generated. The only remaining work at the site is wetland restoration, which is ongoing.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is conducting its fifth five-year review of the Woodstock Municipal Landfill Superfund Site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up - with waste managed on-site - to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. EPA will include a summary of cleanup activities and an evaluation of the protectiveness of the implemented cleanup remedies in the five-year review report.

Cleanup actions at the site have included removing contaminated wetlands and installing a landfill cap. During this five-year review, EPA will be conducting a site inspection, reviewing the status of the cleanup, and conducting a review of the current data. The review is expected to be completed in September 2025.
