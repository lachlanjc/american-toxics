### Background

The 10-acre Kurt Manufacturing Company site is located in Fridley, Minnesota. The site operator has been machining and fabricating metal components since 1960. An industrial solvent spill contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was being addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions under state oversight as a part of EPA's enforcement deferral pilot agreement with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). It is now being addressed through PRP actions under federal and state oversight.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires groundwater capture zone analysis and implementation of an additional groundwater-related institutional control.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included soil removal, soil vapor extraction, groundwater extraction and treatment, well abandonment, sump removal and capping, and institutional controls. Construction of the remedy took place between 1986 and 2010. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.
