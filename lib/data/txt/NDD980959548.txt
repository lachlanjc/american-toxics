### Background

The 26-acre Minot Landfill site is located about one mile southwest of downtown Minot, North Dakota. The landfill operated from 1961 to October 1971, receiving shipments of municipal and industrial wastes. These shipments included drums of oil, spent battery casings, calcium carbide and lime sludge. Landfilling operations contaminated groundwater, surface water, soil, sediment and air with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1997.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires addressing areas of erosion on the landfill cap, removing trees bordering the cap, and cleaning out and inspecting drainage swales on a regular basis.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included consolidation of contaminated soil in the vicinity of leachate seeps under the a landfill cap; cap improvements to limit precipitation infiltration and control stormwater runoff; installation of a passive gravity drain system to manage landfill leachate; groundwater monitoring; passive venting of landfill gas; and institutional controls. Remedy construction took place in 1996. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.  

Site cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions in 1989 included installation of a perimeter fence around the landfill, construction of surface runoff erosion control (including swales and storm sewer piping), and seeding of areas disturbed by construction and exposed slopes along the southern edge of the site. In 1990, additional work to repair discharge ditches  
and swales took place to complete the removal actions.
