### Background

The Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals site is located in Columbia, Mississippi. It includes an area where several companies produced wood derivatives from 1936 to 1977. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1986 because of contaminated groundwater, soil and sediment resulting from facility operations. EPA, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination.

EPA took the site off the NPL in 2000. Additional work is not expected at ths site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The 81-acre site is located in Columbia in Marion County, Mississippi. The site includes the North Pond area, which is located in the northeast corner of the site. Fencing surrounds the North Pond area and vegetation covers the area. Residential areas border the site to the north, east and south. Residential areas include low-income and minority residents. Commercial businesses border the site to the west.

- From the early 1930s until 1943, J.J. White Lumber Company operated a sawmill at the site. From 1936 until 1951, several companies operated at the site, producing wood derivatives such as resin, turpentine, pine oil and tall oil. Operations grinded pine stumps and digested them with a boiling liquor.
- In 1975, Reichhold Chemicals purchased the site property and used the area to mix pentachlorophenol with diesel oil.
- In 1977, an explosion and fire in one of the boiler units destroyed most of the facility and operations ended.
- In 1984 and 1987, EPA performed two emergency cleanup actions at the site. In 1984, EPA removed 600 drums and drained two on-site ponds. In 1987, EPA removed 1,920 tons of contaminated soil and 3,900 empty and partially filled drums.
- In 1999, The site’s PRPs completed the three-year groundwater monitoring program. EPA and MDEQ confirmed that groundwater contamination did not pose a threat to people and the environment.
- In 2000, Following the completion of cleanup activities, EPA took the site off the NPL. The site's deletion notice states that, *"with concurrence of the Mississippi DEQ, EPA has determined that all appropriate responses under CERCLA have been completed, and that no further action is necessary."*

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Site investigations and cleanup activities have focused on two areas, which EPA refers to as operable units, or OUs. These areas include OU-1: contaminated soil and sediment; and OU-2: North Pond area.

- In 1989, EPA issued a cleanup plan (a Record of Decision, or ROD) for OU-1. The plan included removing aboveground and underground storage tanks and debris; draining on-site ponds; digging up contaminated soil and sediment and disposing of the material at an off-site facility; placing clean fill in the dug-up areas; digging up tar-like waste materials and treating the materials off site; disposing of treated materials at an off-site facility; monitoring groundwater; and preventing erosion at the site.
- In 1997, EPA issued a cleanup plan (a ROD) for OU-2. The plan included EPA’s decision that no cleanup activities were necessary to address groundwater contamination. The plan required a three-year plan to confirm groundwater contamination did not exist. Following completion of the monitoring plan, EPA and MDEQ would evaluate groundwater contamination.

EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 2000. EPA does not anticipate additional work at the site.

### Enforcement Information

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRPs to investigate and clean up the site. The PRPs funded site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
