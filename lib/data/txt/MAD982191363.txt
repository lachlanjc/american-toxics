### Background

The Blackburn & Union Privileges site is located in a primarily residential area in Walpole, Massachusetts. Industrial activities on site resulted in serious contamination in the form of inorganic chemicals, such as asbestos, lead, arsenic and nickel, as well as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs).

Once known as The Blackburn Privilege and The Union Factory Privilege, the site was originally part of 10 distinct water privileges along the Neponset River in the 17th century. Snuff, iron, nails, cotton and wool were produced there. A tannery also was located in this area. Power was generated by a dam on the Blackburn Privilege. Since the 17th century, industrial and commercial facilities have been active on six of 24 lots in this area, with the rest used as residential and commercial properties. Industry and commerce during the 17th and 18th centuries involved hazardous substances, including chromium, arsenic and mercury.

Beginning in 1915, Standard Woven Fabric Co. manufactured asbestos brake linings that involved crushing raw asbestos. In 1920, the company changed its name to Multibestos. In 1937, the plant closed and properties were sold to Kendall Co., which used the site for cotton and fabric production. The wastewater was brought within sewer permit requirements and disposed of in two lagoons. It was then discharged to a sanitary sewer after cotton fibers had settled out. Kendall stopped using the first lagoon as a disposal area in 1982; the second lagoon received cooling waste until 1985.

The site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in May 1994.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. The remedial action consisting of the excavation and disposal of contaminated soil was completed in 2018. A groundwater treatment facility was constructed and has been operating since 2019. The system collects, treats, and discharges groundwater west of South Street. The remedial action consisting of the excavation and disposal of contaminated sediment from the Neponset River impoundment called Lewis Pond was completed in 2019 and wetland restoration activities have been completed, with the wetland form and function restored as of late 2024.

The Town of Walpole has taken ownership of several properties on the site, and since constructed a senior center and a police station on the site. The PRPs demolished the former mill building and constructed a parking lot for use by the senior center and police station.

Remaining future actions include operation and maintenance of the groundwater treatment facilities, institutional controls, and restored wetlands. In 1992, a culvert was constructed to carry the Neponset River through the property and isolate contaminated soil west of South Street. The PRPs continue to monitor the culvert's condition and are evaluating strategies to address the structure as it approaches the end of its design life.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy includes treating on-site groundwater that is contaminating surface waters as well as restricting groundwater use on site and monitoring groundwater to make sure contamination is not moving off site over the long term. The groundwater treatment facility was completed in 2019 and has operated continuously since then. Contaminated soil from an area of the site east of South Street has been excavated and disposed of off site. The area from which this contaminated soil has been removed has been redeveloped by the Town with the construction of a senior center and police station. Contaminated material consolidated in an area behind the former abandoned mill building, sometimes referred to as “the burrito,” has been evaluated and determined to be non-hazardous waste and can therefore remain on site. The PRPs demolished the abandoned mill building on the west side of South St. and constructed the groundwater treatment facility and a parking lot for the police station and senior center in its location - all of which now comprise a cap on the properties over potentially contaminated soil. Another component of the cleanup is maintaining the Neponset River culvert which has contaminated material consolidated around it. Long-term inspections and maintenance of the culvert and surface cover features on the properties are required as part of the cleanup. The culvert has remained in-place for over 30 years and is nearing the end of its useful life. In 2023, the PRPs presented a conceptual design to the Town of Walpole. The proposal would remove the culvert and restore the Neponset River from South Street through the "west of South Street" portion of the site. EPA, MassDEP, the PRPs and the Town are continuing to refine the long-term management strategy for the culvert system.

Land use and access restrictions at the site have been established. Lewis Pond, an impoundment downstream of the site, was excavated to remove contaminated sediment. Remedial actions and restoration were completed in 2019, and long-term wetland monitoring was performed between 2019 and 2024. The monitoring program was recently completed and ensured that the wetland system serves the same form and function as it did prior to the remedial actions.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**

This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The matrix below is a general summary of the restrictions at this site at the date of this report. The information in this matrix is a general description of the restrictions at the site only. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.

The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above. Note that where multiple entries occur, it will impact more than one pathway.

Two Notices of Activity and Use Limitation (NAULs) were recorded with the Norfolk County Registry of Deeds in 2021. These notices define uses consistent with the site conditions. Generally, child-sensitive activities (residences, schools, and daycares) are inconsistent with the NAULs, while commercial, municipal, industrial, or passive activities (parking and walking across the site) are consistent with the NAULs. Activities disturbing the cover systems (such as construction of new buildings or utilities) must be designed to address health and ecological risks and coordinated with EPA and MassDEP.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1988, buried tanks were removed and disposed of offsite. In 1992, soils contaminated with asbestos were excavated, consolidated and capped with a 30-inch soil cover. A 400-foot long aluminum plate arch was built to isolate a portion of the Neponset River running through the area where contaminated soils were consolidated and capped. The portion of the site where the asbestos soils were consolidated has been fenced to ensure the cap is not disturbed. In 2009, the abandoned mill building west of South Street, and soil in an area close to the site next to the Neponset River were investigated. Cleanup included the disposal of nearly 30 tons of asbestos and asbestos-containing debris, as well as more than 2,700 pounds of hazardous materials and waste oils.
