### Background

The 31-acre Kerr-McGee Chemical Corp [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) Site is situated on the west bank of the St. Johns River in the main industrial port area of Jacksonville, Florida. It includes an area where fertilizer and pesticides were produced from 1893 to 1978.

The EPA placed the site on the Superfund Program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 2010 because of contaminated soil and groundwater, resulting from facility operations.

The EPA, the [Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP)](https://floridadep.gov/) and Tronox (a successor to Kerr-McGee), the former Site’s [potentially responsible party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), have investigated site conditions and taken steps to protect people and the environment from the site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the Site. A water line connects residences and businesses to the public water system. The Site is currently undeveloped and unoccupied. A six-foot chain-link fence surrounds the Site to prevent unauthorized entry.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Site’s PRP, Tronox, initially led site investigation and cleanup activities. Since 2011, the EPA has led investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with FDEP and the site Trustee.

Site investigation activities are focused on two areas, which the EPA refers to as [operable units, or OUs](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#o). These areas include:

- OU-1: Site soils, groundwater, and sediment in the St. Johns River
- OU-2: Sediment in Deer Creek

**1984**  
The Site PRP, FDEP, the EPA, and the Multistate Trust conducted several environmental studies to identify the nature and extent of the contamination.

**2016**  
The EPA issued a [Record of Decison (ROD)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11068665), a Site cleanup plan for OU-1 in December 2016

In 2022, the EPA issued an Explanation of Signinicant Differences (ESD) to the 2016 ROD. The 2022 ESD summarized proposed changes to the remedy for Operable Unite 1 (OU1) for the Site. The EPA has determined that the adjustments to the remedy proposed in this ESD are significant, but do not fundamentally alter the overall remedy with respect to scope, performance or costs.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA, in collaboration with FDEP and the Site’s Trustee, the Multistate Trust, will continue to maintain the site and monitor the groundwater.

The Multistate Trust is currently developing the remedial design documents for OU-1.

Remedial investigation activities for OU-2 are on-going. After completing the remedial investigation, the EPA will issue a cleanup plan for OU-2.

The Multistate Trust began the OU-1 pre-design field investigation activities in May 2018. These activities were completed in 2019.

The second phase of the OU-1 remedial action field activities began in January 2025 and are expected to be completed by 2028.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, the EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

In March 2000, the EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site PRP to investigate and clean up the Site. In 2009, Tronox filed for bankruptcy and relinquished ownership of the Site and created a Multistate Environmental Response Trust. The Trustee, The Greenfield Environmental Multistate Trust LLC, provides funding and works with the EPA and FDEP to clean up the Site.
