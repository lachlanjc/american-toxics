Background
The Olmsted County Sanitary Landfill occupies around 52 acres of a 304-acre property in Olmsted County, Minnesota. The landfill began operating around 1970 and accepted mixed municipal solid waste as well as commercial and industrial solid waste until 1987. In 1987, the landfill closed to all except demolition debris and ash from the Rochester Public Utilities power plant. Final closure of the landfill began in 1993. Waste disposal operations contaminated groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1995. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) Closed Landfill Program.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) is the lead agency for the site, which currently manages the site as part of its Closed Landfill Program.  MPCA regularly monitors and maintains the landfill cap and leachate collection system. 

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site’s long-term remedy included a landfill cap and a leachate collection system. In 1994, EPA determined that the site did not require cleanup beyond what would be required under state laws and regulations. In 1994, under a waste permit issued by the State of Minnesota, a landfill cap and leachate collection system were put in place. EPA took the site off the NPL in 1995. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing by MPCA's Closed Landfill Program.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Landfill wastes contained a variety of contaminants. Groundwater was contaminated with low levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and heavy metals.
