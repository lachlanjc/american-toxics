### Background

The Hastings Ground Water Contamination Site is located in and around Hastings, Nebraska. The site was placed on the National Priorities List in 1986. The site consists of seven subsites with 21 operable units (OUs). Contamination from a vapor degreasing operation, former landfills, a coal gas plant, an industrial park and a grain elevator have contaminated public and private water supplies. Some subsites and residential properties have been cleaned up. However, environmental risks remain and long-term cleanup is ongoing. Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

The Well No. 3 Subsite contains a groundwater plume of carbon tetrachloride (CT) and a second contaminant plume of chlorinated industrial solvents, primarily trichloroethene (TCE), which is being managed by the potentially responsible party (PRP).

The Colorado Avenue Subsite contains soil and groundwater contaminated by industrial solvents related to vapor degreasing operations at an industrial facility during the 1960s and 1970s. Groundwater contamination was discovered in 1983 when the city attempted to return a municipal well (M-18) back into service at a location approximately one-half mile east of the source area.

The Second Street Subsite contains soil and groundwater contamination from a coal gas plant which operated from 1894 to 1931. Historical investigations identified benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (BTEX) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in subsite soils and groundwater.

The North Landfill Subsite originated as a brick maker’s clay pit which was later operated by the city as a landfill in the early 1960s. Various municipal and industrial wastes were disposed at the landfill which have contributed to groundwater contamination. The site is currently unused.

The FAR-MAR-CO Subsite has been utilized for storage and handling of agricultural products, primarily grains, for more than 30 years. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including grain fumigants, have seeped into the soils and groundwater as a result of operations and a spill from fumigant equipment. Land use at the site has not changed. A separate area of 1,1,1‑trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA) (OU11) contamination was discovered during the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency investigation at the subsite in 1987.

The South Landfill Subsite originated as a clay pit which was constructed into a two-cell landfill with a drainage ditch between the cells. The landfill was operated by the city of Hastings from the early 1960s to the early 1980s and received both municipal and industrial waste. The site is currently used as a recreational dog park. Hastings East Industrial Park and Former NAD is located east of the city of Hastings and covers more than 72 square miles, approximately 48,000-acres. The property was used for loading armaments until the early 1950s and later for de-militarizing armaments until it was decommissioned in the early 1960s.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Well #3 Subsite: Dutton-Lainson addressed the TCE groundwater contamination under an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to conduct a soil vapor extraction (SVE) removal cleanup. These Removal Activities began in March, 1996. The AOC also required that Dutton-Lainson, which had been identified as the potentially responsible party (PRP) for the subsite, monitor groundwater. In May 2001, the EPA released its final decision document for the Well #3 subsite selecting no further action for source control operable units and extraction and treatment for groundwater. The EPA and Dutton-Lainson Company signed a Consent Decree (CD) to perform this work. Dutton-Lainson began operating the groundwater extraction system in May 2003, initiated groundwater monitoring in June 2003, and samples the groundwater twice a year. The long-term remedy included full-scale soil remediation, air stripping to treat groundwater, soil vapor extraction (SVE) and monitoring. Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing. The EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the subsite’s remedy. These reviews evaluate whether the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the subsite are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires evaluation of the remedy and investigation of other contaminant sources.

Colorado Avenue Subsite: On September 28, 1990, the EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order to Dravo Corporation and Desco Corporation, the subsite PRPs, to construct and operate the SVE system. The long-term remedy, implemented and maintained by Dravo, included SVE, air stripping and in-well aeration. Cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the subsite are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires implementation of a remedy for a portion of the groundwater plume.

Second Street Subsite: SVE, enhanced biodegradation, excavation and thermal treatment of contaminated soils and institutional controls were part of this subsite’s long-term remedy. Enhanced biodegradation increases oxygen available to microorganisms to speed the natural breakdown of material. Institutional controls restrict well drilling. Cleanup activities are ongoing. Treatment systems began operation in January 1997, and are currently being operated by the NDEE. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the subsite are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires addressing the remaining soil contamination.

North Landfill Subsite: In October 1992, the EPA and the city of Hastings and Dutton-Lainson entered into an AOC to perform the remedial design. The city and Dutton-Lainson remain the active PRPs for the subsite. Initial cleanup activities at the subsite included improving the landfill cap and restricting public access and future land use. The long-term remedy included groundwater extraction and treatment, via air stripping. Monitoring is ongoing. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the subsite are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment at the subsite.

FAR-MAR-CO Subsite: SVE was the selected initial remedy. An SVE pilot project removed over 1,200 pounds of contaminants from the soils. The SVE system operated until 2003. A groundwater extraction system began operating in 1996. The EPA entered into an AOC with Morrison Enterprises in June 1996, to perform a groundwater removal action. Pumping and treatment is ongoing, with Morrison Enterprises as the active PRP. In 2010, enhanced in-place biodegradation (injection of vegetable oil) to reduce ethylene dibromide and carbon tetrachloride contamination occurred. Cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the subsite are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy is protective of human health and the environment in the short term. In the interim, cleanup activities have controlled exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks.

South Landfill Subsite: The selected long-term remedy included landfill capping and monitored natural attenuation of groundwater. Natural attenuation describes a variety of in-place processes that, under favorable conditions, act without human intervention to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume or concentration of contaminants in groundwater. The PRPs installed the cap in 2005. The most recent review concluded that a protectiveness determination for the subsite cannot be made until the EPA conducts more groundwater monitoring and vapor intrusion investigation activities. The ongoing PRP for this subsite is the city of Hastings. The city's contractor has prepared a draft Focused Feasibility Study to evaluate possible modifications to the remedy. At present, the EPA and the contractor are working out technical issues.

Former Naval Ammunition Depot (NAD) Subsite: Removal actions, or short-term cleanups, for the subsite included excavation of manholes, a catch basin, piping and contaminated soils, sludges and liquids, air sparging and soil vapor extraction. Later cleanups included excavation, storage and incineration of contaminated soils. In 2011, the EPA selected a remedy of “no further action” for parts of this subsite and long-term management for one part of the subsite. Sitewide groundwater at the Former NAD is being addressed by extraction and treatment. Groundwater contaminated with explosives is being treated with ultraviolet light to break down contaminants, while groundwater contaminated with volatile organic compounds is being treated with an air stripper. The remedy is considered protective in the short term, though additional vapor intrusion and ecological risk characterization is needed. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, an agent for the Department of Defense (DOD), has conducted all investigatory and cleanup work under EPA and state oversight. The USACE is currently investigating whether any buried munitions-related waste, derived from rocket-firing exercises, represents a risk via any exposure pathway.

Area-Wide Hastings Site: The selected interim remedy for area-wide groundwater included establishing an institutional control area (which does not include the NAD), providing an alternate water supply for affected users, completing a well inventory and groundwater monitoring. The most recent review concluded that the remedy is protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Long-term protectiveness requires implementation of institutional controls across the extent of the groundwater plume. The Area-Wide PRP Group includes all active Hastings Groundwater Contamination Site PRPs except for the DOD.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed through federal, state, local and potentially responsible party actions. The EPA has been involved in the investigation and cleanup of the Hastings Site since its discovery. Currently, the EPA is either conducting cleanups or enforcing implementation and maintenance of the remedies at subsites for which private and/or government entities have been identified and have entered into Consent Decrees with the EPA.

  

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The remedy at the Hastings Groundwater Contamination Site includes an institutional control area (ICA), administered by Hastings Utilities, in place to prevent exposure to contaminated groundwater through unauthorized access.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Groundwater samples are collected from site monitoring wells, irrigation wells and city water supply wells.
