### Background

The 10-acre Standard Mine site is located in the Ruby Mining District of the Gunnison National Forest in Gunnison County, Colorado. Silver mining began in the southern Ruby Mining District in 1874, and continued up to 1974 at several mine sites in the area. Standard Mine was one of the three largest producing silver mines in the Ruby Mining District. Mining activities at the site contaminated soil, surface water and groundwater with heavy metals. These heavy metals are then deposited into Elk Creek, which flows into Coal Creek and eventually to downstream water users. Before the completion of Phase 1, the site had waste piles along with open and unmarked adits and shafts.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s long-term remedy consists of two phases. The first phase addresses source control. The first-phase remedy includes contaminant controls; construction of a concrete flow-through bulkhead; waste rock stabilization; adit discharge controls; interim monitoring; and institutional controls. After monitoring to determine if the Phase 1 remedy was successful it will be determined if Phase 2 is necessary. If necessary, Phase 2 will include the construction of a passive water treatment system to improve water quality in Elk Creek.

Phase 1 of the remediation is complete. To complete this phase in 2017 EPA finished source control work, including completion of the flow-through bulkhead, adit discharge controls (both within the adits and at the surface) and revegetation. EPA has also set up an interim monitoring program and is hoping to use a local watershed coalition to implement the monitoring. The interim monitoring period will last 3–5 years and will help EPA and the State determine whether additional steps are necessary to meet the Remedial Action Objectives (RAOs) identified in the Record of Decision (ROD). Throughout Phase 1 EPA, the State and the Standard Mine Advisory Group provided comments that were incorporated into the final design plans. The work completed in 2017 achieves all of the remedial design elements included within Phase 1 for this site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has issued a minor modification to its cleanup plan for the Standard Mine Superfund Site, that continues surface water quality monitoring through 2027 to evaluate impacts of an extended bulkhead closure. This factsheet provides more information on the extended bulkhead closure. The bulkhead was closed on June 16, 2023.

This site is one of many across the country to receive funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which invested $3.5 billion in environmental remediation at Superfund sites on the National Priorities List. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law increased EPA funding for ongoing and planned Superfund cleanup projects across the country.

### Enforcement Information

Settlements were reached with insurers for the potentially responsible parties and private funds were placed in a special account to pay for some site activities.
