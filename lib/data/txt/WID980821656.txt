### Background

The Onalaska Municipal Landfill site is located in the town of Onalaska, Wisconsin. It consists of a 7-acre landfill on an 11-acre parcel next to the Black River. The landfill area was formerly a sand and gravel quarry. From 1969 to 1980, the town operated the landfill, which accepted municipal and industrial wastes. Facility operations contaminated groundwater with hazardous chemicals.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The original cleanup, which consisted of a landfill cover, groundwater pump and treat system, and a bioremediation system, was completed in 1994. The bioremediation system was shut down in 1998 and the groundwater system was discontinued in 2001. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources assumed control of the site in 2002.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA completed its [fifth review of the site's cleanup](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/541681.pdf) in April 2018. This type of review is required at least every five years where the cleanup is complete, but hazardous waste remains managed on-site. These reviews are done to ensure that the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. The review included evaluations of:

- Background information
- Cleanup requirements
- Effectiveness of the cleanup and any anticipated future actions
- Maintenance and monitoring
- An analysis of ways for EPA to operate more efficiently

The review concluded that the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. The next review will be in 2023.

EPA, along with the Wisconsin DNR, approved an amendment to the original cleanup plan in September 2012 to address volatile organic compounds that are still in the groundwater. The new plan (called the Record of Decision Amendment) allows for the groundwater pump and treat system to be permanently shut down and uses natural processes to clean up the VOCs in groundwater.

Two private water supply wells close to the landfill, which had high levels of manganese, were replaced as part of the amended plan.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
