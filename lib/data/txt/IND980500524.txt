### Background

The 50-acre Lake Sandy Jo (M&M Landfill) site is located in Gary, Indiana. A landfill operated on site between 1971 and 1980. Various wastes, including construction and demolition debris, garbage and industrial wastes, and drums are believed to be buried on site. Following cleanup, the site’s long-term remedy is in place. Operation and maintenance activities and groundwater monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Once the long-term stewardship plan is completed including consideration to enhancing the institutional controls, the remedy will be protective of human health and the environment over the long term as well. The site’s next five-year review is due in July 2021.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s remedy included a clean soil cover, fencing and drinking water line extensions for nearby homes. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management, with EPA oversight secured institutional controls, and continue to monitor groundwater and maintain the soil cover.
