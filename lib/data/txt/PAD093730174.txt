### Background

Commodore Semiconductor Group Site (CSG) is located near 950 Rittenhouse Road, Norristown, Pennsylvania in Montgomery County in the Park Pointe business park, formerly known as the Valley Forge Corporate Center (VFCC). The 950 Rittenhouse Road property is 14-acres and was previously owned by Commodore Business Machines, a semiconductor manufacturer. It was chip manufacturing facility from 1970 to 1993. Waste solvents were stored in an underground concrete storage tank on site until 1975, when it was taken out of service.

An unlined steel tank was installed next to the concrete one in 1975. Inspections conducted by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) indicated that both tanks leaked and contaminated groundwater. The majority of residences in the area are connected to a privately-owned public water supply, however, a small number of individuals still have operational private wells.

Audubon Water Company (AWC) is the current and historical supplier of public water to residents and businesses in this area and was first to identify a contaminant of concern (COC) near the site in 1978: trichloroethene (TCE). Following the detection of TCE and related COCs, this site was proposed for the EPA’s National Priorities List in January 1987 and was officially listed in October 1989.

In 1992, EPA decided on a remedy to treat the COCs at CSG and issued a Record of Decision (ROD) announcing this roadmap to cleanup.). The EPA often divides complex sites into several distinct zones to make cleanup actions more efficient; these areas are called operable units (OUs). This site consists of three Operable Units:

- OU1 - Provide safe drinking water to residents
- OU2 - Pump and treat system for contaminated groundwater

As of 2020, both OUs were still considered to be protective of human health and the environment.

- In 2022, OU3 was added to the Site to investigate for sources contributing to groundwater contamination at CSG. 960 Rittenhouse Road (OU3) is just to the Northeast of the original site at 950 Rittenhouse Road.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1981, Commodore excavated soils and pumped water from a contaminated well, then sprayed it onto surrounding fields. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) dissipated into the air. Since 1984, air strippers have been in use to remove solvents from the groundwater. Air strippers have been installed on all affected public wells through agreements between Commodore and the local water authority. Also in 1984, household carbon units were installed at residences where VOC concentrations of at least 1 part per billion were detected in private wells. On September 29, 1992, EPA issued a [Record of Decision (ROD)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2262684) which required the performance of additional remediation at the site which included: groundwater extraction and treatment, extension of the existing waterline to affected residences, and continued maintenance of household carbon units. On June 29, 1993, EPA issued a unilateral order to Commodore Business Machines, and Rockwell Automation, Inc. (Rockwell) (formerly Allen Bradley, LLC.) to carry out this work. Rockwell has complied with the order, while during this time Commodore Business Machines went bankrupt.

The waterline extension and laterals to the residences were completed in January 1997. Transfer of the ownership of the waterline extension to Audubon Water Company was completed in December 1997. The connection of the residences and the closing of the residential wells began in January 1998.

The groundwater extraction and treatment system (GWRTS) began treating groundwater in August 2000. The system functioned successfully to contain, and capture site-related VOCs. Analytical data indicate that contamination concentrations decreased significantly. However, residual levels of VOCs exist beneath the site property. The highest level of contamination associated with the Site exists in an upgradient shallow bedrock well.

In September 2003, Rockwell Automation completed additional work to enhance and speed up the groundwater treatment. This enhanced treatment included the installation of a full-scale vapor extraction system to remove chemical vapors from the soil and bedrock, chemical oxidation to treat residual contaminant levels in soil near and beneath the building, and air injection/sparge-vapor extraction (AI/S-VE) for the perched zone source area located beneath the southeastern, slab-on grade portion of the building. Rockwell continues to coordinate with EPA and PADEP to reach cleanup standards set forth in the ROD.

A plume stability verification (PSV) study began in December 2014 by turning off the GWRTS with the understanding that the GWRTS would be restarted if semi-annual groundwater monitoring yields results greater than a calculated threshold for each contaminant. The plume stability verification study continues to provide an opportunity to observe changes in the distribution of contaminants over the area when the groundwater recovery wells are off.

Based on the results of off-site investigations and the data collected during the PSV study, EPA has determined that the upgradient source of VOC contamination is the reason for the GWRTS’s inability to remediate the aquifer below desired levels. EPA recently expanded the Site to include the investigation and clean up of this upgradient contamination, now known as Operable Unit 3 (OU3).

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA continues to oversee the cleanup activities at the Commodore Semiconductor Group site by Rockwell. EPA continues to work closely with the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to determine how the site can successfully achieve its cleanup goals, in light of contamination from other sources in the area.

The EPA often divides complex sites into several distinct zones to make cleanup actions more efficient; these areas are called operable units (OUs). This site consists of three Operable Units:

OU1 - Provide safe drinking water to residents

OU2 - Pump and treat system for contaminated groundwater

As of 2020, both OUs were still considered to be protective of human health and the environment.

In 2022, OU3 was added to the Site to investigate for sources contributing to groundwater contamination at CSG. 960 Rittenhouse Road (OU3) is just to the Northeast of the original site at 950 Rittenhouse Road. EPA will be performing a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for OU3. The RI is an in-depth study designed to gather data needed to determine the extent of contamination at a Superfund site and establish site cleanup criteria. FS is a study of the applicability of proposed actions or plans.

Once the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) are complete, a Proposed Remedial Action Plan will be open for 30 days of public comment. Once public comments are gathered on the proposed plan, EPA will issue a final decision on OU3’s cleanup called the Record of Decision (ROD). ROD is a public document that explains which cleanup alternative was selected for a Superfund site. These documents will define the cleanup actions to be implemented, based on risk to human health and the environment. Click h [ere to see the Superfund schedule image](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/03/2350743.pdf) for steps that follow this period.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent, [2020 Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/03/2302583.pdf) (PDF), found that the remedy is protective in the short-term as there is no current exposure to site-related contaminants. Long-term protectiveness of the remedy will be achieved by maintaining effective institutional controls and determining how the site can successfully achieve its cleanup goals, in light of contamination from other sources in the area. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2025.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The site property has institutional controls in place to minimize groundwater use, prevent possible future vapor intrusion and protect the integrity of the constructed remedy. Additional information about the institutional controls is available in [2020 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2302583) (pages 7 and 8).

### Emergency Response and Removal

The cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. The site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) led removal actions in 1981 and 1984. These actions included excavating contaminated soil, pumping water from a contaminated well and spraying it onto surrounding fields, installing air strippers on all affected public wells, and installing household carbon filtration units.
