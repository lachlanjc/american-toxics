Background
The 1,400-acre Summitville Mine site is a former gold mine in Rio Grande County, Colorado. Gold mining started in the late 1800s. By 1984, the Summitville Consolidated Mining Corporation Inc. began open pit mining for gold, copper and silver. Mining processes, waste disposal practices, and the discharge of large amounts of copper and other metals to Wightman Fork and the Alamosa River contaminated soil, surface water and groundwater with heavy metals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through state and federal actions.EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires completion of the SDI seepage capture system and refinement of water management practices in the Cropsy basin; commissioning of the new water treatment plant; completion of the SDI spillway raise; completion of the seepage diversion downstream of the A3-Ditch Turnout; revision of the site water balance; and implementation of a Mine Pool Management Program.Institutional control options are currently being developed to ensure the long-term protectiveness of the remedy. These controls will be documented in a modification to the site’s Record of Decision (ROD).

What Is the Current Site Status?
The Summitville Mine Site was listed for cleanup under the Federal Superfund program on May 31, 1994. Since that time, several remedial activities have been completed. The cyanide formerly contained within the heap leach pad (HLP) has been treated and detoxified. Mine waste piles have been contoured, capped and revegetated. The open pits have been filled in and capped. Mine adits and entrances to underground have been plugged and Sealed. Mining impacted water is captured in the Summitville Dam Impoundment and cleaned in the water treatment plant prior to leaving the site. Construction activities are complete, and the site is now in the operation and maintenance phase. The water treatment plant generally operates April through October and can treat up to 2100 gpm. Land use restrictions are also in place at the site to maintain the integrity of the remedy. Site monitoring is ongoing. This site is one of many across the country to receive funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which invested $3.5 billion in environmental remediation at Superfund sites on the National Priorities List. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law increased EPA funding for ongoing and planned Superfund cleanup projects across the country. Top of Page
Green Remediation
In 2009, the site received $17 million in American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) funds to construct the Summitville water treatment plant. Completed in 2011, the water treatment plant removes high metals concentrations from acid mine drainage originating at the site. Plant construction provided more than 100 construction jobs in this area, and the cleanup significantly contributed to improving the water quality and restoring fish and aquatic life to the Alamosa River and Terrace Reservoir.
