### Background

The Site includes four closed public drinking water supply wells, a groundwater plume contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs), an industrial facility owned by Ramallo Brothers Printing, Inc., (Ramallo), and a former dry cleaner facility (International Dry Cleaners or IDC). The four closed drinking water supply wells are owned by the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA). The Ramallo Property is located in the Cidra Industrial Park (CIP), which is currently owned and/or managed by the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (PRIDCO). The Ramallo Property is presently vacant. The IDC Property is located in the commercial district of Cidra. The IDC Property includes a two story building on Mu√±oz Rivera Avenue in Cidra. IDC had occupied the first floor, which is presently vacant, and an occupied residential unit is located on the second floor.

The Cidra Ground Water Contamination site consists of a ground water plume of VOCs contamination. Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDOH) ordered the following four public supply wells in Cidra, Puerto Rico to be closed due to contamination by tetrachloroethylene (PCE):.Cidra Well 4 (Calle Padilla Final) in March 1996; Cidra Well 8 (Frente Cementerio) in October 1996; Cidra Well 3 (Planta Alcantarillado) in February 1999; and Cidra Well 6 (Calle Baldorioty) in August 2000. Other chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including 1,1-dichloroethylene (1,1 -DCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE), were also detected in the wells before they were closed. Cidra Ground Water Contamination site is located in Cidra, Puerto Rico

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In June 2002, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 2 Site Assessment Team (SAT) began an Expanded Site Inspection (ESI) of the Cidra Ground Water Contamination site. Confirmatory ground water samples were collected from the closed wells and 20 other active and inactive wells in Cidra. PCE was detected in the closed wells at concentrations ranging from 0.64 to 12 micrograms per liter (ug/L), and was also detected in two nearby industrial supply wells at the Zenith Laboratories site at concentrations as high as 4.1 ug/L. Related chlorinated solvents, including 1,1-DCE; 1,1-dichloroethane (1,1-DCA); cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (cis-1,2-DCE); carbon tetrachloride; and TCE, were also detected in ground water samples collected from the closed wells and Zenith Laboratories industrial supply wells.

Public Supply wells were placed out of service and a RI/FS was conducted to determine magnitude and extent of contamination and determine the need to implement remedial action alternatives. A RI/FS was conducted and a ROD signed in 2014. In 2020 EPA completed the RD stage of the project which included three RDs (IDC, Ramallo and the GW)..The selected remedy will address the soil and groundwater contamination detected at the Site protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA conducted a Fund Lead Remedial Investigation/FeasibilityStudy in order to determine the magnitude and extent of the contamination and to identified potential responsible parties. Water supply wells were closed after a survey detected contamination. A ROD was signed in September 30, 2014. Under the selected remedy, soil contamination will be addressed at the IDC and the Ramallo Properties by using soil vapor extraction, excavation, disposal and containment. Groundwater contamination under and downgradient of the Ramallo Property will be addressed by implementing an *in-situ* treatment remedy to remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs), coupled with long-term monitoring. Currently EPA is implementing the RA for the former IDC property and making arrangerment to conduct a fund lead RA for the other two portions.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The nature and extent of contamination in Site media was assessed during the RI by collecting and analyzing samples and then comparing analytical results to federal, Commonwealth, and Site-specific screening criteria. Five chemicals were identified as Site-related contaminants: PCE, TCE, cis-1,2-DCE, 1,1-DCE, and vinyl chloride. These chemicals were chosen based on the frequency and magnitude of screening criteria exceedances and previous detections in the supply wells. These chemicals also represent degradation products of chlorinated solvents.
