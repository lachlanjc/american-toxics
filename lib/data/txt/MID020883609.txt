Background
The Northernaire Plating Company (Northernaire) site is in Cadillac, Michigan. Northernaire is a former electroplating facility which operated on 12.75 acres of land at the corner of Sixth Street and Eighth Avenue. From 1971 to 1981, it did custom chromium and nickel-plating work on metal parts. Improper waste handling and faulty sewer systems led to the release of hexavalent chromium into the soil and groundwater. In 1978, Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) received complaints from homeowners near the Northernaire Site about their drinking water. Samples collected by the district health department showed hexavalent chromium present in the tap water of two homes. The city of Cadillac extended city water services to these homes. The Northernaire Site has long been closely associated with the adjacentÂ Kysor Industrial Corp. Superfund Site .The predominant contaminant of concern at the Northernaire Site was hexavalent chromium, while the contaminants of concern at the Kysor Site included several volatile organic compounds in the groundwater beneath the Cadillac Industrial Park that were migrating to the north into Haring Township.
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
EPA conducted a removal action on July 5, 1983. EPA containerized and removed waste from the Site. After decontaminating the inside of the building, liquid and sludge wastes were removed from process tanks and shipped to RCRA disposal facilities. Tanks were also decontaminated. The contaminated sewer line to the north of the building was then excavated and removed. During subsequent investigations, hexavalent chromium was detected in groundwater. The study done in 1985 indicated that groundwater contamination remaining from Northernaire consisted of two small hexavalent chromium plumes in the shallow and intermediate aquifers. A pump and treat system were put in place to treat the contaminated groundwater.
What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA and EGLE provided confirmation (August 3, 2020) that operation of the hexavalent chromium treatment system can be discontinued as documented in the 2010 Five Year Review for the Northernaire Site. No Five Year Reviews have been completed since 2010, when EPA told Northernaire that long-term remedial action goals for the Site have been met.
Emergency Response and Removal
Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. These actions included removal of contaminated storage containers, excavation of a leaking sewer line, soil removal and removal of part of the building floor on site.
