### Background

The inactive R&H Oil/Tropicana Energy site is approximately seven acres and was used for various petroleum-refining operations from 1934 to early 1990's. The site is comprised of two contiguous tracts: a northern tract located at 403 Somerset Road and a southern tract located at 507 Somerset Road in San Antonio, Texas. The northern tract previously housed oil refineries and a waste oil recycling facility. The southern tract previously housed oil refineries, a petroleum distribution facility, and conducted fuel/gasoline blending operations.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

On August 13, 2001, the EPA initiated a removal action at the site. The removal action included the removal/disposal of asbestos containing materials; removal/disposal of materials in tanks, piping, equipment and other miscellaneous containers; demolition of tanks, piping, and equipment; and, removal/disposal of visibly contaminated soils. The removal action at the site was completed on October 10, 2001.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The PRP Group, with EPA oversight, is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) with the collection of soil, ground water, and soil vapor data from on-site and off-site areas. The RI/FS began in 2010 and is ongoing. The RI/FS will identify the nature and extent of any remaining contamination, including any potential human health and ecological risks.
