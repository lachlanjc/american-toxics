### Background

The 183-acre site is located at 1610 Moorland Road. It consists of two sludge lagoons near the treatment plant facilities south of the city of Madison. Land use to the northwest is commercial and industrial, while to the west and southwest land use is primarily residential.

The Madison Metropolitan Sewerage District, or MMSD, has operated the Nine Springs Wastewater Treatment Plant since 1933. In April 1970, a portion of the north dike of Lagoon 2 collapsed, and about 85 million gallons of its contents were released into a nearby ditch. A facilities plan, prepared in the mid-1970s, recommended reusing lagoon sludge by recycling and spreading it over agricultural land. In 1982, analysis of a sludge sample from the lagoons showed high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. The site was added to the Superfund list in 1990.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Madison Metropolitan Sewerage District studied the site under a 1992 legal agreement with EPA. A cleanup plan to reduce risk of exposure to PCB-contaminated sludge was delineated in the [1997 Record of Decision (ROD) (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/205639.pdf) (61 pp, 2.83MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ). MMSD worked on the cleanup from 1998 to 2001 as directed in a 1998 legal agreement. Sludge with low levels of PCBs was used in the MMSD agricultural program until 2000.

In June 2018 EPA, in consultation with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, re-evaluated and improved the institutional controls at the site through an [Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/941819.pdf) (4 pp, 169 K, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) in accordance with Superfund law and guidance.

EPA’s cleanup of contamination included the construction of dikes to isolate and consolidate sludge-containing contamination, a soil cover with seeding over areas not covered by vegetation, long-term monitoring. and limiting the use of and access to the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and PRP actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents.

EPA is conducting the fifth five-year review of the site to verify the remedy continues to protect people and the environment. The five-year review is an opportunity for the public to tell EPA about site conditions and any concerns they may have. If you would like to share comments, please contact the Remedial Project Manager listed on this website.

The previous five-year review in 2018 concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.
