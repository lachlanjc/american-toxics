### Background

**Current Status**

The site is presently in the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase of the Superfund process. Ground water monitoring is being conducted annually and the remedial action performance is being assessed every five years to ensure long-term protectiveness. The fifth five-year review (FYR) is scheduled to begin in early 2018. The Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) Group and EPA are currently collaborating on implementing some of the 4th FYR recommendations to ensure long-term protectiveness. The 4th five-year review was completed in August 2013. The site remains protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Several recommendations were proposed to ensure long term protection into the future.

**Site Background**

The 12.8-acre Gulf Coast Vacuum Services (GCVS) site is located about three miles southwest of Abbeville in Vermilion Parish, Louisiana. A vacuum truck and oilfield drilling mud plant operated on site from about 1969 to 1984. Historical operations and waste disposal practices contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following construction of the site’s remedy, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in July 2001. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

**National Priority Listing (NPL) History**  
Proposed Date: June 24, 1988  
Final Date: March 31, 1989  

**Location:** Approximately 2.5 miles southwest of Abbeville, Vermilion Parish. 1.5 miles west of the Vermilion River. Adjacent to the south is the D.L. Mud, Inc. Superfund site  

**Population:** Approximately 2,600 people live within 3 miles of the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and PRP actions. EPA has conducted five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short-term. Several recommendations were proposed to ensure long-term protectiveness. EPA and the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) are currently collaborating on implementing some of the recommendations.  
  
The completion of OU-2 cleanup activities eliminated the threat of overflow of accumulated rainwater contaminated by the sludge pits, thereby reducing the direct contact threat to nearby residents and the threat to local drinking water supplies.

GCVS was a vacuum truck and oilfield drilling mud plant operation from about 1969 to 1984. During operation of the facility, unpermitted disposal of contaminated organic and inorganic materials, primarily oil-industry-related waste, occurred in several open pits. GCVS and its predecessors used the property as a trucking terminal and disposal facility for materials and wastes generated from oil and gas exploration and production. Vacuum trucks were rinsed out in several on-site pits. Unpermitted disposal of contaminated material and waste also occurred.

A citizen's complaint led to site identification by EPA in June 1980. Preliminary sampling identified compounds characteristic of crude oil, salt water and drilling mud oil. In addition, a layer of oil emulsion was observed in the West Pit.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site consists of two areas, referred to by EPA as operable units (OU). EPA selected remedies for the OUs in a 1992 Record of Decision (ROD).  
  
The remedy for OU-1 consisted of the on-site incineration, on-site stabilization and disposal of the organic and inorganic contaminated pit sludge and construction of a clay cover over the material, construction of a clay cover over inorganic-contaminated site soil and sediment, institutional controls, and groundwater monitoring. A 1995 ROD Amendment for OU-1 included a contingency remedy for incineration for biological treatment residuals that did not meet treatment standards. This contingency was not needed.  
  
The remedy for OU-2, an interim action, included source control, such as dewatering the pits with treatment and discharge, consolidation of material in the pits, and placement of an impermeable synthetic membrane over the consolidated material in the West Pit.  
  
Remedy construction began in June 1997 and finished in 1999. EPA approved the site’s Close-Out Report in March 2000. The remedy is in the operation and maintenance phase.  
  
Following construction of the site’s remedy, EPA took the site off the NPL in July 2001.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included three removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In March 1990, EPA constructed a containment levee along the West Pit to prevent off-site migration of contaminated liquid. EPA also pumped out wastewater and treated it prior to discharge. In February and March 1991 and April 1992, EPA pumped out additional wastewater and treated it prior to discharge. EPA also constructed a fence.
