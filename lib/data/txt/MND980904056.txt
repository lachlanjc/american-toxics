### Background

The Oak Grove Sanitary Landfill site is located in Oak Grove, Minnesota. The landfill covers 52 acres of a 104-acre property and contains 2.7 million cubic yards of waste. The landfill received mostly commercial and municipal solid waste, as well as some industrial solid waste and liquid waste, from 1967 to 1984. Landfill operations contaminated groundwater with hazardous chemicals. EPA and MPCA selected a cleanup plan that included installation of a new landfill cap and groundwater and surface water monitoring. The owner of the landfill installed the cap with oversight by EPA. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency took over management of the closed landfill in 1994 and EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1996.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s landfill remedy included capping, groundwater monitoring and deed restrictions to limit use of the landfill property. The site’s groundwater remedy included monitored natural attenuation and institutional controls to protect people from drinking contaminated water. Natural attenuation describes a variety of in-place processes that, under favorable conditions, act without human intervention to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume or concentration of contaminants in groundwater. Construction of the remedies started in 1992 and finished in 1993.

In 1994, the site entered MPCA's Closed Landfill Program. MPCA continues to upgrade the landfill as needed. A 2003 upgrade included construction of a new gas extraction system for the landfill with an enclosed flare.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review, conducted in 2017, concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short-term. EPA’s review also recommended that MPCA re-sample nearby residential wells to confirm that they are not impacted by the landfill, and that MPCA sample groundwater for a new contaminant, 1,4-dioxane, to see if it is present at the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The closed landfill is maintained by MPCA, including monitoring of methane gas near the landfill edges. MPCA also regularly samples groundwater and surface water near the site.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Prior to cleanup, many organic and inorganic contaminants were detected in shallow groundwater, including vinyl chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, benzene, arsenic and nickel at concentrations above drinking water standards. Leachate samples from the landfill also contained a variety of organic contaminants.
