### Background

The approximately 60-acre Muskego Sanitary Landfill site is in Muskego, Wisconsin. A former landfill, animal-rendering plant and gravel quarry were located on site. While it was operation in the 1950s and 1960s, it contaminated groundwater with hazardous chemicals.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s long-term cleanup included the removal of buried drums, upgrades to the site’s landfill cover and gas collection systems, and a collection and treatment system to address leachate and groundwater contaminated with volatile organic compounds such as vinyl chloride and heavy metals, including lead and chromium, from landfill waste.

Although primary elements of the cleanup (landfill capping; leachate and groundwater collection and treatment; and air and groundwater monitoring) were in place in 1997, the cleanup has been reviewed often. The 1999 review recommended various follow-up activities, including hooking up nearby residences to the public water supply system and abandoning several drinking water wells.

The 2004 review found the cleanup might not be working as expected because groundwater contamination had been moving off-site. The review recommended further groundwater investigation.

A legal document called an explanation of significant differences was signed in 2009 and a legal document called a consent decree was signed in 2011 providing additional monitoring and groundwater monitored natural attenuation (MNA).

Continued long-term protectiveness required further evaluation of the groundwater cleanup, institutional controls, monitoring, and operation and maintenance. EPA updated the cleanup in 2010. The update included expanded institutional controls, an MNA evaluation, and an evaluation of some cleanup components. The MNA evaluation is ongoing. Other work underway includes a wellhead protection communications plan, in cooperation with the city of Muskego, to ensure that city well #7 is not affected by contaminated groundwater.

EPA has also completed the installation of eight additional groundwater monitoring wells, development of an updated operation and maintenance plan, and a plan to limit the use of landfill property and groundwater. A plan to maintain and, if necessary, improve source control technologies currently in use, including landfill liquid and gas collection systems and landfill cap and groundwater treatment and monitoring systems, is also ongoing.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA completed a [sixth site five year review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/992137) was completed in June 2024 and concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.

In 2019, EPA completed [a five-year review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/948056.pdf) (57 pp, 4.46 MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) of the site that also found the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.

In 2018, after the required institutional controls were implemented, the site was determined to be [ready for anticipated use (pdf)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/557079.pdf) . (2.46 MB )
