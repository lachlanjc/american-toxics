### Background

The Washington County Lead District – Furnace Creek Site includes soil, groundwater, surface water, mine waste and sediment contaminated with arsenic, barium, cadmium and lead associated with historical mining practices in southeast Missouri. The Furnace Creek area encompasses about 533 square miles (341,000 acres) in the southern and western parts of Washington County, Missouri.

Washington County is part of Missouri's Old Lead Belt, where lead mining occurred for hundreds of years. While it was being mined, the Old Lead Belt provided about 80 percent of the lead produced in the United States. In Washington County, the first mines were mostly surface diggings advanced by manual labor with a pick and shovel. Starting in 1799, deeper mines were started in the area. Additionally, this area is part of the barite mineralization district of Missouri. After the Civil War, numerous small barite mines operated in Washington County until the early 1900s. Barite mining boomed in 1926 as the mineral's use for oil drilling mud was discovered. For a number of years, before declining in the 1980s, Washington County was the world's leading producer of barite. Many of the large barite mining operations reworked lands that were previously hand-mined for galena (mineral source of lead) or barite. Washington County has hosted over 1,000 lead and barite mining, milling or smelting sites.

Remnants of mining activities throughout the area include strip mines, mineshafts, mine dumps, tailing areas, tailings ponds and associated dams. There are several large tailings impoundments, associated dams and leachate ponds with elevated levels of lead present at the site. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources has developed a database of the state’s known mining occurrences known as Incidents of Mines, Occurrences, and Prospects (IMOP). Currently there are over 1,000 entries in the database for Washington County.

As development in the area progressed over the last 200 years, residents of the area have constructed homes and developments on mine waste. Old tailings ponds are particularly attractive to prospective property owners interested in building near a lake. Historically many people have used mine waste as an inexpensive option for use in gravel driveways or even sand boxes for children. Unfortunately, many people moving into the area are not familiar with the mining history of the area or the health risks associated with exposure to mine waste containing lead, arsenic and cadmium.

This site is separated into five Operable Units. OU1 includes residential properties. OU2 includes groundwater. OU3 includes mine waste. OU4 includes surface water and sediment. OU5 includes rail lines. The EPA work at the OUs is on a priority basis based on the potential for human health and environmental risks.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 2008, the EPA began a Removal Action to clean up lead contaminated soil at highly contaminated residential yards and to provide water filtration systems to homes where lead in the water exceeds the health-based levels. The EPA, under the Remedial Program, continues to clean up lead contaminated soil at residential yards. To date, the EPA has cleaned up contaminated soil at 376 properties and provided water filtrations systems to 13 residences.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Operable Unit 1 - Residential Yards

This site is one of many across the country to receive funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which invested $3.5 billion in environmental remediation at Superfund sites on the National Priorities List. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding will be used to conduct cleanup of lead-contaminated soil at residential properties.

The EPA issued an Interim Record of Decision in 2017 to address residential properties that were not addressed under the Removal Program and began cleanups under the Remedial Program in 2019. The EPA’s current remediation contractor, EA Engineering Science and Technology Inc., will begin cleaning up lead contaminated soil at residential properties in Spring 2025. Per the contracts with the EPA, remediation contractors observe a winter shutdown period from December 15 to February 28. If property owners have questions, they are encouraged to call the point of contact listed on this page. Property owners frequently refuse access for remediation leaving a number of properties un-remediated where access has been attempted.

An additional approximately 2,815 properties remain to be sampled at the Furnace Creek Site. The EPA’s START contractor, Tetra Tech, is in the process of getting access and collecting these soil and water samples. About one in four properties that are tested qualify for cleanup of contaminated soil. Property owners frequently refuse access for sampling leaving a number of properties unsampled where access has been attempted.

Operable Unit 2 - Groundwater

In 2022, the EPA signed an Interim Record of Decision that selected the use of Point-of-Use water treatment systems as an interim remedy for providing an alternative source of water to residents that qualify. The selected remedy also includes health education and institutional controls. The EPA is currenty implementing this remedy. The EPA is also evaluating whether restoring the groundwater aquifer to its pre-mining conditions is practicable. This is a challenge since the contaminated aquifer underlies hundreds of square miles of land in Washington County. The EPA's goal is to ensure that all residents with water exceeding health-based standards are provided a permanent source of safe drinking water.

Operable Unit 3 - Mine Waste and Operable Unit 4 - Surface Water and Sediment

The EPA continues to work on the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for Operable Unit 3 (Mine Waste) and Operable Unit 4 (Surface Water and Sediment).

Operable Unit 5 - Rail Lines

The EPA is currently developing a search to identify Potentially Responsible Parties for the contamination associated with the abandoned rail lines.
