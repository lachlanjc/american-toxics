### Background

The Orange Valley Regional Groundwater Contamination Superfund site consists of a groundwater contamination plume, which is an area where ground water is contaminated. A specific source of the contamination has not yet been definitively identified. The site is in the municipalities of Orange and West Orange, Essex County, New Jersey. During a site investigation in West Orange, EPA collected groundwater samples from public water supply wells. The Orange Park and Gist Place municipal supply wells were found to contain [tetrachloroethylene (PCE)](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts18.pdf), [trichloroethylene (TCE)](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts19.pdf) and [cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (cis-1,2-DCE)](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts87.pdf). The PCE and TCE contaminants exceeded EPA’s maximum contaminant levels (MCLs). The water department data for January to June 2009 confirmed the constant presence of the contaminants in the wells. A third public supply well, known as the Brook Alley well, exhibits similar contamination with [volatile organics](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/technical-overview-volatile-organic-compounds). This well has been discontinued.

During site investigations, EPA identified some possible sources of contamination within the area of the contaminated wells. Additional databases and state files identified several other potential sources of contamination near the wells.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 2012.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Orange Water Department is currently operating a treatment system that removes the contaminants and provides the community with safe drinking water that meets federal, state, and local standards. In addition, the water quality is routinely monitored to ensure the treatment system is effective.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is working on a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) which is a detailed investigation to examine the nature of contamination and alternatives for cleanup at a Superfund site. The overall cleanup approach will be developed after the investigation and will be available for public review.

EPA last sampled the groundwater in the fall of 2019 to determine the nature and extent of groundwater contamination. EPA is continuing to investigate and sample the groundwater and tentatively expects to have its RI/FS completed in June 2024.

### Sampling and Monitoring

EPA collected groundwater samples from 17 wells for [volatile organic compounds](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/technical-overview-volatile-organic-compounds) and [Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)](https://www.epa.gov/pfas) in October 2019 and analyzed samples to determine the source of the contaminant. EPA focused on evaluating the groundwater at residential and commercial properties identified in the [Hazard Ranking System (HRS)](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/hazard-ranking-system-hrs) report and where access was provided.

EPA reviewed the information provided by property owners or their representatives (i.e., environmental consultants or attorneys) to assess historic contaminant concentrations at the site. Before sampling, EPA visited the three municipal wells and the properties to assess well access and well conditions.
