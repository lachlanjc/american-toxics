### Background

Fairfax Street Wood Treaters [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) (FSWT) site is located at 2610 Fairfax Street in Jacksonville, Florida. The 12-acre property is in a dense residential area, adjacent to two elementary schools, a day care center and several homes.

From 1980 to 2010, Wood Treaters, LLC pressure treated utility poles, pilings and other lumber products using the preservative chromated copper arsenate (CCA). Wood Treaters, LLC filed for bankruptcy, and by July 2010 ceased operations and abandoned the facility. Seven above ground storage tanks, in poor condition, contained high levels of arsenic, chromium and copper. In August 2010, the [Florida Department of Environmental Protection](https://floridadep.gov/) requested the EPA's assistance in mitigating the release of hazardous substances to the environment.

Wood treated with CCA drip-dried on the property, resulting in arsenic, chromium and copper contamination. During operations, some contaminated storm water flowed off the site and onto surrounding properties including a parking lot retention pond and Moncrief Creek. Wood treating operations resulted in soil, water and sediment contamination with chromium, copper and arsenic.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA led site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), and the Florida Department of Health.

**2010 – 2011**  
EPA conducted removal actions, or short-term cleanups, in 2010 and 2011. These actions included:

- removing contaminated soil on the Susie E. Tolbert Elementary School playground located near fence line with the site;
- removing contaminated water and sediment from the retention pond on the school property;
- removing contaminated soil from unpaved parts of the former wood-treating facility;
- treating and disposing of more than 150,000 gallons of contaminated water;
- cleaning and removing chemical storage tanks, containment area and piping;
- removing contaminated soil from three residential properties;
- covering exposed soils with gravel to prevent the spread of contamination through dust and stormwater runoff (gravel previously cleaned by EPA);
- transporting contaminated soil, sludge and debris off site for proper disposal; and
- repairing and placing a lock on site fencing.

**2012**  
EPA proposed the site to the [National Priorities List (NPL)](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-national-priorities-list-npl) in March 2012 and finalized it on the NPL in September 2012. During 2011 through 2013, EPA conducted an extensive investigation, the Remedial Investigation (RI), to define the nature and extent of contamination. In addition, a Risk Assessment was conducted to define the risks posed by the contamination and identify the areas that require clean up. The [Remedial Investigation](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/10977855.pdf) and Risk Assessment have been completed.

**2017**  
EPA evaluated different technologies that will be used to clean up the site. This was documented in the [Feasibility Study (FS)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/10977855.pdf). After completing the FS, EPA issued a [proposed long-term remedy](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/10785245.pdf) to address any additional contamination and mitigate risk to people and the environment. After receiving input from FDEP and the community, EPA issued the final long-term remedy for the site in the [Record of Decision (ROD)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11068632.pdf) that was signed on August 22, 2017.

**2019**  
EPA has completed cleanup activities to address soil and sediment contamination at the Fairfax Street Wood Treaters Superfund site from March 2019 through October 2019. The cleanup included:

- Removal of 60,000 tons of contaminated soil and sediment;
- Transport of contaminated materials to an appropriate disposal facility;
- 60,000 tons of clean backfill and top soil used to restore of excavated areas;
- Remediation of the 12.5-acre wood treater property and 51 residential properties.

Here is the [Final Fact Sheet](http://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11140099.pdf) for this site.

**2020**

The site was deleted from the National Priorities List (NPL) in the [Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/18/2020-16375/national-oil-and-hazardous-substances-pollution-contingency-plan-national-priorities-list-deletion) on August 18, 2020.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) have determined that all appropriate responses under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended, have been implemented for this site. The remedial action performed at the Site which included removal of contaminated soil to allow for unrestricted use and unlimited exposure is protective of human health and the environment.

### Emergency Response and Removal

EPA conducted an Emergency Response and a Removal Action in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The actions taken are summarized in ["What Is Being Done to Cleanup the Site?"](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.cleanup&id=0410582#Done).

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

In 2012, a federal bankruptcy court in Jacksonville, Florida approved a settlement agreement between the site’s Chapter 7 Trustee and the EPA regarding the bankruptcy of Wood Treaters, LLC. Additional enforcement efforts are on-going.
