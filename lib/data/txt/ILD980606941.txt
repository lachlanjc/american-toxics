### Background

The 132-acre Eagle Zinc Co Div T L Diamond Superfund site is in Hillsboro, Illinois. From 1912 to 2003, the site was used for manufacturing and smelting of sulfuric acid, zinc oxide, and leaded zinc oxide. The Site originated as a zinc smelter facility under the name Lanyon Zinc Company in 1912. The facility was then purchased by Eagle-Picher Industries in 1919. Eagle-Picher Industries operated and produced similar products until about 1935. Manufacturing of lead zinc oxide continued until around 1958 and production of zinc oxide continued until around 1980 when the facility was purchased by Sherwin-Williams Company. In 1984, the facility was sold to Eagle Zinc Company, a division of T.L. Diamond and Company. Eagle Zinc continued the production of zinc oxide until 2003 when the facility ceased industrial operations. Residuals from the plant operations were placed across the site and in residue piles that have been categorized based on the processes that generated them.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Eagle Zinc project is divided into three areas called “operable units”, or OUs. The cleanup at OU1 consisted of fencing the site and then demolishing buildings that were so deteriorated it created a safety hazard. The demolition work occurred from December 2014 through September 2015 and is fully complete. Some of the building material (e.g. metals) was recycled and the remainder was hauled off-site to a landfill.

In 2016, EPA changed the cleanup plan for Operable Unit 2 of the site to address the cleanup of residential properties. A Record of Decision was issued in September 2012 that called for the cleanup at industrial areas of the site. During remedial design sampling, EPA discovered lead-contaminated soil in a residential area. Changes that differ significantly from the remedy selected in the ROD are summarized the [Explanation of Significant Differences (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/541512) (12 pp, 993 K, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ). The current ESD shows that the OU2 residential cleanup conforms with the current national lead policy.

EPA constructed a 10-acre containment cell on-site to hold the zinc slag and other zinc processing waste material left behind on the Eagle Zinc property. The contaminated materials from the site waste and contaminated soil from two nearby residential properties was placed into the containment cell. The cell was closed and covered with clean soil to prevent further exposure. EPA also cleaned up a portion of land directly east and across the street from the Eagle Zinc property. The contaminated soil from this property will be disposed of in a nearby landfill.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA signed an Interagency Agreement with the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct the cleanup at the Site. From 2017 until 2023 the Corps will conduct the cleanup at OU2, which includes the detailed remedies outlined in EPA’s 2016 ROD and two ESDs.

In 2018, EPA began investigating OU3, which includes on-site groundwater, off-site soils and sediments, and surface water, to determine nature and extent of contamination. In 2021, EPA completed the investigation and will then complete a Feasibility Study that will outline the cleanup options for OU3. After a public comment period, EPA will issue a ROD that outlines the selected cleanup remedy for OU3.
