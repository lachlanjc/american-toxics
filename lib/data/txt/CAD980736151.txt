Background
The 7-acre Purity Oil Sales, Inc. site is located near Fresno, California. A used oil reprocessing facility operated on site from 1934 to 1974. The potentially responsible party (PRP) stored oil and byproducts from the refining process in storage tanks and disposed of them in sludge pits on site. These improper storage and disposal practices, and occasional spills at the site, contaminated groundwater and soil with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), heavy metals, phenols, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), oil, grease and pesticides.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal, state and PRP actions.EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the siteâ€™s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires examination of remedial options and implementation of a final remedy for contaminated groundwater, development of a groundwater management zone strategy, and implementation of institutional controls.

What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA is addressing the site in three stages: initial actions, cleanup of the groundwater and tanks, and cleanup of the soil.Initial Actions: Initial actions included pouring concrete over potentially hazardous parts of the site to reduce human contact with wastes. In 1985, EPA removed and disposed of about 1,800 cubic yards of hazardous materials from two waste pits and several surface seeps, and 25,000 gallons of liquid from an aboveground storage tank. EPA solidified the sludge in the pits before excavating and backfilling the pits. In 1987, EPA removed 33,000 gallons of oil and water from an on-site tank and fenced the site to restrict human access.Groundwater and Tanks: The selected long-term remedy to address the contaminated tanks included removal and disposal of contaminated wastes in the tanks; solidifying tank wastes prior to off-site disposal; and cleaning, dismantling and disposal of the tanks off site. EPA removed remaining tanks in 1991. The final long-term remedy to address contaminated groundwater included extraction wells, air stripping technology, and filtering of iron and manganese from the water. Affected residents are receiving alternate water supplies. Groundwater treatment began in 1995. EPA is considering updating the groundwater remedy after it was determined that site conditions prevented the pumping and treatment system from operating.Soil: The long-term remedy included soil vapor extraction, capping of site soils, installation of a slurry wall around the site and monitoring. EPA updated the remedy in 1996 to include enclosing the North Central canal, constructing an impermeable cover with a soil vapor extraction system over the site, and including the rear market areas in the cleanup. Enclosing of the North Central Canal with a concrete pipe finished in 1998. While construction of the cap occurred, families living near the site voluntarily relocated. EPA has installed the cover and plans to install the soil vapor extraction system under the cap.
