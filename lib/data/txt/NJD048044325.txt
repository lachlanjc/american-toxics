### Background

The Landfill & Development Company site located in Burlington County, New Jersey is a 200-acre closed landfill. The site occupies portions of the Townships of Mount Holly, Eastampton, and Lumberton. The landfill consists of two sections, the Mount Holly section on the west and the Eastampton section on the east. In addition, the site includes five sedimentation ponds, a perimeter road, a leachate collection system, a landfill gas management system, and a solar power farm.

The site operated as a sand and gravel pit from the early 1940's until approximately 1968. The disposal of demolition debris in the Mount Holly section of the landfill took place from 1962 into the late 1960s. During this period, a 10-foot thick layer of refuse was deposited on the excavated base of the sand and gravel pit. In 1968, the landfill owner leased the Mount Holly section to the Mount Holly Township for use as a landfill, which began accepting industrial and commercial solid waste and sewage sludge. The Landfill and Development Company (L&D), currently owned by Waste Management of New Jersey, Inc., acquired the site in 1971 and ran landfilling operations in the Eastampton section of the site from 1976 until 1981. L&D Company operated the landfill until December 31, 1986 when it stopped accepting waste after reaching its permitted capacity.

The site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) initiated a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) in 1986.

Groundwater investigations at the site found that the shallow aquifers (the Mount Laurel/Cape May Sands, and the Middle Wenonah) were contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including: 1,2-dichloroethene, 2- butanone, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, acetone, benzene, cis-1,2-dichloroethene, methylene chloride, toluene, and vinyl chloride. Inorganic groundwater parameters impacted by the landfill at one or more moniotoring wells included chloride, hardness, ammonia, total dissolved solids (TDS), iron, lead, manganese, and sodium.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The landfill sections were closed in 1995, in accordance with an NJDEP approved closure plan. The engineering controls that are maintained as part of the landfill post-closure requirements include a leachate collection system in the Mount Holly section and, in a limited area of the Eastampton section, a methane gas collection system, and a clay cap. In addition, residents downgradient of the landfill using private wells were initially provided with bottled water by L&D Company to ensure that they were not potentially exposed to contaminants originating from the site. Private water supply wells were later installed in the deeper clean aquifer at a number of these residential properties to ensure a permanent clean source of water.

Groundwater cleanup at the site began in 2007 and included groundwater extraction with water and air recirculation systems. Additional protective measures include the application of institutional controls which serve to limit the use of groundwater at the site. A Classification Exception Area (CEA) was established for impacted aquifers underlying the landfill and downgradient of the landfill, extending to Rancocas Creek. The CEA is intended to ensure that the uses of the aquifer are restricted until appropriate standards are achieved. The CEA, established in 2008, restricts the use of the Mount Laurel/Cape May Sands, and the Middle Wenonah aquifer, but not the Englishtown aquifer. The Englishtown aquifer, which underlies the Mount Laurel/Cape May Sands and Middle Wenonah aquifers, has not been impacted by the landfill.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The L&D Company operates the leachate recovery system as part of its landfill closure permit. Collected leachate is sent to the local sewage treatment plant for disposal. Landfill gas is collected and flared (methane recovery was discontinued because it was no longer economically viable). The groundwater recirculation component of the groundwater cleanup system was discontinued in 2011, and by 2015, all groundwater extraction wells were shut down. Site fencing is maintained, the cap inspected and mowed, and the leachate collection system continues to function as designed.

A third Five-Year Review was issued on December 22, 2020, and concluded that the L&D remedy remains protective of human health and the environment.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The landfill cover, fence, and continued maintenance of these barriers prevent direct contact with landfill contents and control surface water runoff and erosion. All residential wells in the affected aquifers have been decommissioned, and the installation of new wells is restricted through a Classification Exception Area. These institutional controls prevent human consumption of groundwater from contaminated aquifers in the area.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The L&D Company continues to conduct long-term monitoring in accordance with the approved Long-Term Groundwater Monitoring (LTM) Plan. As part of the LTM, monitoring wells are sampled at intervals established in the plan.

### Enforcement Information

On May 15, 1976, NJDEP issued an Amended Registration and Stipulation for the operation of a sanitary landfill to L&D Company. On September 13, 1982, NJDEP issued a second Amended Certificate of Approved Registration and Engineering Design Approval. The Certificate required that a comprehensive groundwater investigation be conducted at the site to determine the nature and extent of contamination at the site and required that a study be undertaken to determine how best to abate or prevent such contamination. In 1983, EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List (NPL).

Groundwater contamination was detected in the immediate vicinity of the landfill. On May 30, 1986, pursuant to the Spill Compensation and Control Act, NJDEP directed L&D Company to remove or arrange for the removal of such hazardous substances in the groundwater by providing NJDEP funds to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study. On September 30, 1986, NJDEP awarded a contract to perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS). On July 21, 1988, the contractor submitted a report that presented data showing that hazardous substances were discharged into the groundwater. In 1988, the L&D Company entered into an Administrative Consent Order (ACO) to fund a RI/FS. A Phase I Report was issued in July 1988. The L&D Company and NJDEP entered into a second ACO in July 1990 to complete a Phase II RI/FS.
