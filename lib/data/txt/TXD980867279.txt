### Background

The Odessa Chromium #1 site is located just outside Odessa, Texas, in Ector County's Precinct #1. Chrome-plating operations in the 1960s and 1970s contaminated groundwater with hexavalent chromium. The Texas Water Commission discovered the chromium contamination in a well in 1978 and current studies estimate the contamination plume to cover nearly 20 acres. Site remedy, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and local actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires evaluation of whether the leach field area needs to be capped, completion of the downgradient well inventory and sampling effort, and continued operation and maintenance activities.

Chrome plating operations in the 1960s and 1970s contaminated groundwater with hexavalent chromium. The Texas Water Commission discovered the chromium contamination in a well in 1978. The estimated surface projection of the groundwater plume is over 20 acres.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA divided the site into two operable units (OUs) to prioritize and manage cleanup.

*OU-1:* Addressed areas affected by groundwater contamination. The long-term remedy included extension of municipal water supplies to the affected area of the site. Construction of the remedy finished in 1988. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

*OU-2:* Addressed contaminated groundwater. The site’s long-term remedy included demolition and disposal of a contaminated building; extraction, treatment and reinjection of contaminated groundwater; and groundwater monitoring. EPA later updated the remedy to include in-place treatment to address residual chromium contamination in the soil and aquifer. Construction of the groundwater treatment plant and installation of monitoring wells began in 1992. The groundwater treatment plant was operational from 1993 to 2004. In-place treatment began in 2002 and is ongoing as needed. In-place treatment has effectively reduced chromium concentrations. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

EPA completed construction activities for the FY 2021 Odessa Chromium # 1 Final RA Report Waterline Expansion Project in November 2020.The FY 2021 Odessa Chromium # 1 Final RA Report Waterline Expansion Project will be posted on the Site webpage sometime in early July 2021.

EPA has completed the FY 2021 Five Year Review (FYR) for the Site on September 20, 2021. The FYR is a document that determines whether or not a Site is protective of human and environmental health. The remedy for the Odessa Chromium #1 Superfund site is protective in the short term. Since the 2016 Five Year Review, water supply lines have been extended to provide additional residents with a source of clean drinking water and to eliminate human health exposures to contaminated drinking water. The document is was uploaded to available the Site webpage on September 21, 2021 and information is now avaialble at the local repository.

EPA recently uploaded a copy of the FY 2022 Odessa Chromium I Groundwater Monitoring and Sampling Report January 2022. It was added to the Site webpage on Friday June 24, 2022.

Currently EPA is in the process of planning to characterize the chromium plume in groundwater and define the plume boundary with additional monitoring wells. EPA will also be updating it's groundwater monitoring plan. This will be used to provide the information to assess the nature and extent of the chromium plume. EPA will perform additional site investigations and evaluate remedial alternatives to address the contaminated source area and groundwater.

### Sampling and Monitoring

TCEQ performs semi-annual sampling events for groundwater. They also conduct operations and maintenance activites at the Site.
