### Background

The Kenmark Textile Corp. site was located in East Farmingdale, New York. Since at least 1917, the site was the location of several silk and textile dye, printing and screening operations.

Since at least 1917, the site was the location of several successive silk and textile dye, printing and screening operations. Wastewater generated in the manufacturing process was originally disposed of in a leaching pit. The sludge from the wastewater was fed to sludge drying beds for settling and drying, and then drummed prior to off-site disposal. Three subsurface leaching pools were also located at the site. A wide range of chemical dyes and washing chemicals, including base dyes, acetic acid, citric acid and chromate solutions, have been used in site operations since 1972.

As early as 1972, process wastewater generated at the site was chemically treated, resulting in the precipitation of solids from the wastewater. The sludge from the wastewater was distributed to outdoor concrete-lined beds for settling and drying. The sludge was periodically removed from the sludge drying beds and placed in drums. The resulting wastewater (supernatant) was discharged to the leaching pit on-site and east of the building. Beginning in November 1984, the wastewater was discharged to Suffolk County’s publicly owned treatment works.

Three subsurface leaching pools were located south of the building beneath a paved parking lot. Access to each of the leaching pools was through a manhole. The original function of these leaching pools was not known, although it was suspected that they were used to collect parking-lot surface runoff and textile printing process wastewater.

Sampling between January 1974 and May 1984 found that wastewater discharged into the on-site leaching pit contained hexavalent chromium, copper, iron, lead, silver and phenols in violation of New York State groundwater discharge standards. The site was addressed through a combination of Federal, State and potentially responsible party actions.

Following initial actions to protect human health and the environment, and site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in June 1986. EPA took the site off the National Priorities List in May 1995.

Facility operations contaminated groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following short-term cleanups, EPA determined that the site did not pose a risk to human health and the environment. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in May 1995..

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed in two stages: immediate actions and a long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.

Immediate Actions: Susquehanna Textile Corporation, a tenant at the site, removed some of the contaminated materials from the surface. More than 50 drums containing hydroxide sludge that were stored on site were removed from the site.

Long-term Cleanup: Following a remedial investigation to determine the nature and extent of site contamination, EPA determined that the site did not pose a risk to human health or the environment. EPA selected "no action" for the site’s remedy in March 1994

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Drums and other visibly contaminated materials were removed from the site to ensure the safety of the public and the surrounding environment. In March 1994,

EPA determined that no further action was warranted at the site. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s NPL in May 1995.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

EPA determined that institutional controls were not required for the site. The site was deleted from the NPL in May 1995.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Sampling and monitoring are not being conducted at the site. The site was delisted from the NPL in May 1995.
