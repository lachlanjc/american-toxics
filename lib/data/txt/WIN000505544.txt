### Background

The Unity Auto Mart site consists of chlorinated solvent contamination in groundwater originating from the Unity Auto Mart, a former gas station/convenience store, coin-operated laundromat, and dry cleaner. Unity Auto Mart first started as gasoline station in the early 1960s. A dry-cleaning business was added later and operated between 1979 to 1984. The gas station changed hands several times, remaining open until 2012. The property is currently being used as a fireworks store that is open from May through September. The state of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) first identified chlorinated solvents at the property in 1999. By 2014, WDNR requested U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s assistance when numerous potable private wells in the Village of Unity were discovered to be contaminated with tetrachloroethene (PCE) and its breakdown products.

The chlorinated solvents found in drinking water wells include PCE and its breakdown products. To date, the chlorinated plume has contaminated 17 private wells, including eight wells with levels above the Safe Drinking Water Act Maximum Contaminant Levels. The contamination plume is currently estimated to span approximately 25 acres. Most residents within a 4-mile radius of the Unity Auto Mart facility rely on private groundwater wells for drinking. WDNR provided carbon filters or alternate water supplies to residents whose drinking water wells contained PCE and TCE exceeding standards. EPA has assisted WDNR with monitoring and delineating the extent of contamination. The state of Wisconsin referred the site to the EPA because substantial investigations and long-term cleanup are required.

On March 17, 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced the Unity Auto Mart will be added to the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) of contaminated sites that pose significant human health and environmental risks.
