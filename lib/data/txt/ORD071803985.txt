### Background

The 4.2-acre Harbor Oil Inc. site is in Portland, Oregon, in an industrial area adjacent to Force Lake. A waste oil recycling facility currently operates on the site. Past site operations included a tank truck cleaning business. In 1974, a fire and a large oil spill contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater with metals, oil, pesticides and PCBs (highly toxic industrial compounds). In 1979, another fire destroyed the facility and ruptured five 20,000-gallon aboveground used oil tanks.

Site investigations have determined that contamination does not pose an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. Therefore, no further action is required.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

The Harbor Oil site is located at 11535 North Force Ave, on about 4 acres adjacent to Force Lake, in an industrial area of northeast Portland. The surrounding area was once a World War II neighborhood called Vanport. Vanport was destroyed in a 1948 flood. The Harbor Oil facility began cleaning tanker trucks in the 1950s and began oil recycling in 1961. A fire destroyed the facility in 1979 and released chemicals into the wetlands and Force Lake. After the fire, the facility was reconstructed and expanded.

Since the early 1970s, the facility has had multiple state and federal inspections and permits for its discharges and operations. EPA put the Harbor Oil site on the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) in 2003. In 2007, EPA negotiated with some of the potentially responsible parties to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS).

The potentially responsible parties (PRPs), known as the Harbor Oil Voluntary Group, are Avista Corp., Bonneville Power Administration, Chevron USA Inc., North Western Corp., Portland General Electric Co., Texaco Downstream Properties Inc., Texaco Downstream LLC, The Montana Power Co., Union Oil Co. of California, and Waste Management Disposal Services of Oregon Inc.

EPA also ordered the previous operator, Energy and Materials Recovery Inc. to sample a 320,000-gallon metal tank containing water, oil, and solids. The tanks contained petroleum wastes. In 2008, the facility emptied, cleaned, and later dismantled the tank. EPAâ€™s remedial investigation of Harbor Oil shows that no cleanup is needed, because the site contamination does not pose an unacceptable risk to human health or to the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Site investigation results showed that the contamination does not pose an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. Therefore, in 2013, EPA determined that no further action is required at the site. No additional work will be done at the site by EPA unless new information is discovered.
