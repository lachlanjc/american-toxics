### Background

The 35-acre Agrico Chemical Company [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in Pensacola, Florida on the northwest corner of Fairfield Drive and Interstate 110.  It includes an area where agrichemical production operations took place from 1889 to 1975. The [Escambia Wood Treating Company](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0400573) borders the site to the north. A mini-storage company borders the site to the south. Interstate 110 borders the site to the east. A CSX railroad switching yard borders the site to the west. Surrounding land uses include commercial and industrial land uses. There are no buildings remaining on the site that are related to past site operations.

The site includes the area where chemical production operations began in 1889. Several companies produced fertilizers at the site between 1920 and 1975. Conoco purchased the facility in 1963 and operated the fertilizer plant until 1972. Agrico Chemical Company purchased the facility in 1972 and operated the plant until 1975. Operations discharged wastewater into four unlined on-site ponds. Bayou Texar, about 1.5 miles west of the Site is a discharge area for ground water migrating from the site.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/what‐superfund) in 1989 because of contaminated ground water, sludge and soil resulting from facility operations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the [Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP)](https://floridadep.gov/) and the site's [Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working nearby. A water line connects residences and businesses to the public water supply. By monitoring ground water, inspecting the site, placing institutional controls on the site property and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, FDEP and the site's PRPs continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Site investigations and cleanup activities have focused on two areas, which EPA refers to as [operable units or OUs](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#o). These areas include:

**OU1 Contaminated soil and sludge**  
The site’s 1992 long-term remedy for OU-1 included digging up, solidifying and stabilizing contaminated sludge and soil from on-site ponds; consolidating stabilized material in one pond; capping the pond; constructing a below-ground barrier wall uphill from the cap; monitoring ground water; and institutional controls.

**OU2 Ground water**  
The site’s 1994 long-term remedy for OU-2 included using monitored natural attenuation to address ground water contamination, monitoring ground water in the sand-and-gravel aquifer, monitoring surface water in Bayou Texar, placing institutional controls on the site property to restrict ground water use, and establishing an advisory program to inform contractors of ground water conditions at the site.

**1995 thru 1997**  
Site PRPs completed soil cleanup activities at OU-1. The PRPs removed soil and sludge, solidified and stabilized the material, and placed it under a cap on site.

Ground water monitoring activities began at OU-1. PRPs inspect the cap, fences, gates, storm water ditches and ponds twice annually.

**1990**  
The PRPs started an advisory program in July 1999 to inform contractors of ground water conditions near the site. PRPs send a notice annually to water well contractors, irrigation system installers and pool contractors conducting work in southern Escambia County.

EPA placed institutional controls on the site property to limit ground water and land use at the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [fifth Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11150125) was published by EPA HQs in 2020. The remedial actions selected for all OUs at the Site are operating as planned and are protective. The Site's remedy is protective of human health and the environment.

- Ground water monitoring continues at the Site.
- The Site is now in reuse as a pollinator habitat. Plant species that are attractive to butterflies have been installed and are cared for as part of regular Site maintenance.

The EPA is currently conducting the sixth Five-Year Review which will be published in May 2025.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The site is currently fenced and vacant.

EPA placed institutional controls on the site property to limit ground water and land use at the site.

PRPs established an annual notice to advise water well contractors, irrigation system installers and pool contractors conducting work in southern Escambia County informing them of ground water conditions at the site.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site's PRPs to investigate and clean up the site. The PRPs continue to fund site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
