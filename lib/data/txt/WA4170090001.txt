### Background

The 2,700-acre Port Hadlock Detachment (US NAVY) site is located on Indian Island southeast of Port Townsend, Washington. The Navy purchased the island in 1939 and uses it for munitions storage and handling. Potential sources of hazardous substances include municipal and industrial landfills, drum and container storage areas, aboveground and belowground storage tanks, burn pits, and disposal pits. Disposal activities at several site locations resulted in soil, groundwater, sediment and shellfish contaminated with ordnance compounds, heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls ( [PCBs](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=PCB) ) and pesticides. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

A public highway connects the Olympic Peninsula with Indian Island and Marrowstone Island, which has a community of about 250 residences. Groundwater on the island is not currently used for drinking or other domestic purposes. Commercial and recreational harvesting of shellfish and other aquatic organisms occurs on island beaches and in coastal waters surrounding the island. Although most of the island is restricted, civilian boaters occasionally enter along beaches to collect clams. Native Americans have treaty rights to collect shellfish in this area. Fort Flagler State Park is a few hundred feet from the north end of the island. A variety of marine species use offshore waters around the island for spawning, nursing and feeding. The island supports diverse wildlife populations, including the bald eagle.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.

The Navy completed the fifth Five-Year Review of the siteâ€™s remedy in 2020. It concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires the Navy to address shoreline erosion at area 10 and implement necessary repairs, and continue ongoing monitoring and maintenance of area 10 to include maintaining land use controls.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1995, EPA selected a long-term cleanup plan for nine of the 13 areas within the site. EPA declared that seven of the areas (11, 12, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22) required no further action. Cleanup actions required at area 10 (Northend Landfill) included capping, erosion protection, institutional controls and monitoring of groundwater, marine sediment and shellfish. Cleanup actions at area 21 (Building 86 Fill) included groundwater monitoring.

EPA determined that the remaining four areas (13, 14, 16, 17) required no additional actions prior to the issuance of the cleanup plan in 1995. EPA updated the cleanup plan in 2004, clarifying site-specific institutional control requirements and procedures the Navy will follow to implement, maintain and monitor these requirements.

**Cleanup Progress**

The Navy completed the cleanup of area 10 between 1996 and 1997. Remedial action at area 21 took place between 1995 and 1997. After EPA had issued the long-term cleanup plan in 1995, EPA identified six additional areas of contamination (33, 34, 35, 36, HWSA, EO101) and addressed these areas with removal actions or closures under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).

Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2005.
