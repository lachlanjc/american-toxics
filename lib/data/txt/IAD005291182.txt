### Background

The John Deere Ottumwa Works Superfund site is located in the city of Ottumwa, Wapello County, Iowa. The John Deere facility is approximately 118 acres and has manufactured farm machinery since 1900. This activity led to contamination from disposal of solvents, paint sludges, acids, heavy metals and cyanide in an on-site landfill. The selected remedial action at the site includes deed restrictions, continued maintenance of the site's perimeter fence. The EPA deleted the site from the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in 2001.

The EPA completed a Sixth Five-Year Review for the site in March 2023. The remedy at the site remains protective of human health and the environment.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. The EPA completed a Sixth Five-Year Review in March 2023.

The EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews evaluate whether the remedies put in place protect human health and the environment and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that the remedy is protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 2023, the Sixth Five-Year Review, determined the remedy at the site remains protective of human health and the environment. The long-term remedy includes maintaining perimeter fencing around the site and deed restrictions to limit future site uses to non-residential activities. Requirements for groundwater and surface water monitoring ceased in 2018 with the approval of the EPA.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Deed restrictions limit future site uses to non-residential activities.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Requirements for groundwater and surface water monitoring ceased in 2018 with the approval of the EPA.

  

### Enforcement Information

In 1989, John Deere Company entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA to investigate the type and extent of contamination at the site and to identify alternative technologies for the cleanup. On September 25, 1992, John Deere Company and the Iowa Department of Transportation signed a Consent Decree with the EPA to implement the selected remedy. The long-term remedy includes maintaining perimeter fencing around the site and deed restrictions to limit future site uses to non-residential activities.
