Background
The Stewco, Inc. site is located in Waskom, Texas. A tanker-truck terminal and truck-washing facility operated at the site from the early 1970s until 1983. The site consisted of two locations about a mile apart, referred to as Location 1 and Location 2. Location 1 is a half-acre plot that included a maintenance shop with fueling facilities, a truck tank-washing facility, and two backfilled and capped evaporation ponds that received wastewater from the tank-washing operation. Location 2 consisted of a third pond that received wastewater conveyed by truck from the evaporation ponds at Location 1. Waste disposal practices contaminated soil, sludges and groundwater. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund programâ€™s National Priorities List (NPL) in October 1995.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site was addressed through federal and state actions. From 1972 to 1979, R.A. Corbett Transport, Inc. owned, operated and maintained a fleet of transport trucks engaged in contract hauling for the oil and gas industry and various businesses. Stewco purchased the site property in 1979 and continued operations until declaring bankruptcy in 1983. Materials hauled included glue, resin, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and creosote. Wastewater generated from washing the outside of the trucks and residues from steam-cleaning the inside of the tankers were directed to pond 1, with overflow entering pond 2, and the surplus trucked to the third pond at Location 2. All ponds were unlined. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
Site cleanup has included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Between March and May 1984, EPA and the State of Texas removed contaminated liquids from the two evaporation ponds at Location 1. The liquids were treated and discharged. The removal action also removed and disposed of sludges off site, backfilled the ponds and capped them with clay. The removal action sent 6,830 cubic yards of contaminated waste for off-site disposal. It also treated and discharged 350,000 gallons of contaminated water. EPA constructed a fence at Location 2, after it was determined that emergency removal of material from the pond was not necessary.Following the removal action, EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) stating that no further action was necessary to protect public health and the environment. The 1984 removal action was highly effective in mitigating the threats posed by the site to human health and the environment. The site is in the operation and maintenance phase of the Superfund process. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in October 1995.
