### Background

The Combe Fill South Landfill Site is located in Chester and Washington Townships, Morris County, New Jersey. This inactive municipal landfill is located off Parker Road about two miles southwest of the Borough of Chester. The Site consists of three separate fill areas covering about 65 acres of the 115-acre parcel that was owned by the Combe Fill Corporation (CFC).

The site operated as a municipal landfill from the 1940s until 1981 and was licensed to accept domestic and non-hazardous industrial wastes, sewage sludge, septic tank wastes, chemicals, and waste oils. In 1978, Combe Fill Corporation (CFC) bought the landfill. While under CFC management, procedures at the landfill violated many of the New Jersey solid waste administrative codes. CFC went bankrupt in 1981, before the landfill was properly closed. Contaminants have seeped into the aquifer beneath the site. The area surrounding the site is semi-rural. Nearby, Trout Brook is used for fishing and recreational activities. Approximately 170 people live within 1/2 mile of the landfill. Most of the residents use private wells as their source of drinking water. Vegetable and grain crops, orchards, and horse farms are located near the site. In 1986, EPA and the State selected a containment remedy for the site. The containment remedial action has been completed and the site is now undergoing operation and maintenance. This site is being addressed through a combination of Federal and State actions.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1986, EPA and the State selected a remedy for OU1 that included: (1) providing an alternate water supply system for affected residents; (2) covering the landfill with clay or a synthetic material to prevent surface water and rainwater from coming into contact with the buried wastes; (3) installing a system to collect the landfill gases; (4) pumping the shallow groundwater and leachate and treating it prior to discharging it into Trout Brook; (5) installing controls to accommodate stormwater runoff and seasonal increases in precipitation; and (6) doing an additional study to determine if the deep aquifer needs treatment.

Construction of the landfill cap and groundwater extraction and treatment system was completed in September 1997. The groundwater extraction and treatment system has been operational since 1997. Operation and maintenance activities are now ongoing. In April 2006, EPA updated the OU1 site remedy to change the gas venting system from an active system to a passive system. In 2009, sampling activities indicated the presence and potential contamination of 1,4-dioxane located in nearby properties. From 2010 to 2015, EPA conducted remedial investigation activities for the deep bedrock aquifer underlying the landfill and areas outside the landfill property boundary. In July 2015, a waterline was installed to residential properties affected or threatened by site-related groundwater contamination.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The September 28, 2018 ROD describes in detail the primary components of the selected alternative for OU1, which consists of upgrading and expanding the existing groundwater extraction conveyance and treatment system. For OU2, the selected alternative for the interim remedy addresses Site-related contamination in groundwater located outside of the landfill property boundary in order to protect human health and the environment.

A preliminary design investigation and a pilot study were completed in the spring 2020. The 100% Final D report was completed in January 2021. RA preliminary construction activities have begun in January 2023.

A solar panel developer has purchased the Site to install solar panels on the landfill portion of the Site.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

There is fencing located around the site to prevent unathorized use of the site.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Operation and maintenance of the site is currently conducted by NDEP.

### Enforcement Information

In 1985, EPA filed an application in bankruptcy court seeking reimbursement of Superfund monies spent at the Site to date. Because limited funds remained in the bankruptcy estate, EPA and Combe Fill Corporation (CFC) reached a settlement in which CFC paid $50,000 in May 1986 to resolve EPA’s Superfund claims.

In October 1998, EPA and the State of New Jersey filed a complaint seeking the recovery of past and future response costs incurred and to be incurred in connection with the clean-up of the Site. An initial settlement reached in 2005 resulted in a consent decree with former owner/operators that required payment of $12,500,000 in costs to the State and EPA. A second consent decree entered in 2009 settled claims against approximately 300 private parties and municipalities. The consent decree required payment of $69 million in past costs, approximately $3.2 million in natural resource damages, and a $27 million annuity to fund future work at the Site.
