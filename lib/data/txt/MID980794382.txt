### Background

The 1.5-acre Auto Ion Chemicals, Inc. site is located in Kalamazoo, Michigan. From 1914 to 1956, the City of Kalamazoo operated a coal burning electrical generating station on the site. Between 1964 and 1973, Auto Ion treated chromium plating wastes at its facility. Waste disposal operations contaminated site soil and groundwater as well as surface water and sediments in the Kalamazoo River with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent five-year review in 2021 concluded that there is potential for the emerging contaminants per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and 1,4-dioxane to be present in the groundwater because the site was formerly used as a treatment, storage, and disposal facility for electroplating waste. However, because residents and businesses in the area are connected to the municipal water supply and effective institutional controls are in place preventing use of the groundwater, it is not anticipated that emerging contaminants will impact remedy protectiveness.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included long-term monitoring of groundwater, institutional controls and steps to ensure contaminants remain at levels that do not raise concerns about adverse impacts to the Kalamazoo River. Construction of the remedy took place in 1997. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. This includes site maintenance and groundwater monitoring.

In 2012 and 2014, the PRPs conducted studies to characterize pore water and surface water conditions in the Kalamazoo River adjacent to the site including comparisons to Michigan’s groundwater/surface water interface (GSI) values. These studies were conducted with groundwater data for ecological risk screening found in the November 2020 reports "Evaluating Ground-Water/Surface-Water Transition Zones in Ecological Risk Assessments", (EPA-540-R-06-072; "ECO Update" (July 2008). Studies included comparison of groundwater data to screening benchmarks, and it was determined that benchmark values were not exceeded. It was concluded that pursuant to EPA’s ECO Update protocol, site contaminants of concern do not require further ecological risk evaluation.

The PRPs agreed to sample the groundwater for PFAS and 1,4-dioxane to determine if they are present at the site. A quality assurance project plan (QAPP) was submitted for EPA’s review on 10/31/24. Groundwater samples will include analysis for metals (arsenic, chromium, nickel, zinc, mercury) as well as cyanide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (trichloroethene, vinyl chloride), PFAS, and 1,4 dioxane.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Ongoing groundwater monitoring includes measuring water levels and collecting samples for analysis of key chemical parameters two times each year to confirm that concentrations are at acceptable levels, and to assess trends.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions between 1985 and 1993 disposed of contaminated soils, removed a building and added fencing around the site. The soil excavation eliminated the risk of people coming into direct contact with the contaminated soil and removed the major source of contamination to underlying groundwater. The PRPs submitted a Long-Term Stewardship (LTS) Plan, which EPA is currently reviewing for approval to define actions needed to confirm the integrity of the remedy and to ensure that institutional controls remain in place and continue to be effective.
