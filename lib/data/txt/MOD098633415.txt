### Background

The Madison County Mines Site includes all of Madison County and the portion of the historical “Mine LaMotte Tract” that extends northward into southern St. Francois County, Missouri. Mining operations beginning in the early 1700s and ending in the mid-1900s resulted in 13 major tailings and chat deposit areas from mineral processing operations. Erosion of the tailings resulted in heavy metals contamination—primarily lead—of soils, sediments, surface water and groundwater. Contaminated soil, tailings and chat was transported to residential properties for use as foundation bases, driveway aggregate and for use as fill and topsoil. Seven Operable Units are designated for the site:

**OU 1 – Northern Madison County Unit** is located in northern Madison County and consists of the Mine La Motte Recreation Association subsite that contains approximately 250 acres of tailings; Slime Pond, a 100-acre lake used by the MLMRA; the Harmony Lake and Harmony Lake tailings (capped); Basler Mines, also referred to as Copper Mines Tailings/Shoemaker Property (removed); the Old Jack Mine; the Lindsey Mine; the Offset Mine; the Hickory Nut Mines; the small gage feeder rail right-of-way to the abandoned Black Mountain spur and abandoned Missouri Pacific Railroad right-of-way. All associated outflow locations are also included. An EPA-lead Remedial Investigation commenced in 2022 and is scheduled for completion in 2025.

**OU 2 - Anschutz Subsite, historically known as the Madison Mine,** consists of all mining and mine works locations and adjoining areas located immediately southeast of Fredericktown. Included are the A, B, C, D and E tailings areas; a metallurgical pond and sediment pond; remnants of an old mill and smelter and associated slag pile; head frame and abandoned shafts; a mine decline; a refinery complex; a remnant chat pile and mine dump; associated groundwater; surface water and sediments in Goose Creek, Saline Creek and Tollar Branch Creek; the abandoned Black Mountain spur rail right-of-way through Fredericktown and all other mine works locations and outflows affected by these past mining activities.

**OU 3 – Residential Properties** includes Madison County residential yards, public areas, child high-use areas, roadways, right-of-ways, storm water drainages and potable groundwater at private wells in halos of mine waste, mine workings and outfalls. Details of the cleanup actions to date are included in the Site History and Enforcement Activities Sections.

**OU 4 - Conrad Tailings** includes a tailings pile and adjoining Ruth mine and mill complex with its mine waste, surface water and sediments affected by the mine waste, eroded materials in the unnamed tributary to Mill Creek with its floodplain and overbank deposits; adjacent road right-of-ways and drainages, mine waste pile wind-blown contamination; groundwater impacts within the mine waste locations; and all other associated mine works locations and outflows. A focused Feasibility Study and Record of Decision were completed in 2011, and a Remedial Design was developed by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources in 2015. Final consolidation and capping of the operable unit was completed in 2018. OU4 was transferred to the state of Missouri for long-term Operation and Maintenance in September 2019.

**OU 5 - Catherine Mines/Skaggs Tailings** includes the Catherine Mine subsite, the Skaggs Tailings Pile subsite and the Little Saint Francis River subsite. The Catherine Mine subsite consisting of mine waste, a pond, a residential soil disposal repository, Logtown Branch Creek and associated drainages. The Skaggs Tailings subsite consists of mine waste and associated drainages with surface water, sediment, overbank and floodplain deposits along two unnamed drainages. Also included within the Operable Unit is the transect of a former overhead tram which transported parent rock from the Skaggs Tailings subsite to the Little St. Francis River subsite for processing; the LSFR subsite, which includes a tailings pile and mine mill works; and all other associated mine works locations and outflows. A focused FS and ROD were completed in 2012, and the RD was completed in 2014. Remedial action is complete that OU5 was transfered to the state of Missouri for long-term Operation & Maintenance in 2021.

**OU 6 - Silver Mines** includes all other known and undiscovered mining-related contaminated areas on lands controlled by the U.S. Forestry Service including, but not limited to, the Silver Mines area with the Einstein and Apex mines; nearby groundwater, surface waters and sediments in the unnamed runoffs to the Saint Francis and Little Saint Francis River; road right-of-way; public drainage ways; and mine works locations and outflows. This OU has been redefined to include only mining related impacts located on U.S. Forest Service property or affecting both U.S. Forestrty Service lands and adjacent contiguous properties. The EPA and USFS entered a Memorandum of Understanding in December 2020 that defers assessment and removal action cleanup activities of mine waste impacts on USFS lands to USFS with coordination between the USFS and the EPA. The EPA has agreed to defer investigation activities and development of a final cleanup decision while USFS pursues ongoing removal action activities which will ulitmately be incorporated into the EPA's work.

**OU7 – Little Saint Francis River (LSFR)** Watershed includes all surface water, floodplain soil, overbank deposits and sediments in the Fredericktown City Lake and streams in the LSFR watershed that are not specifically addressed under other OUs. The Remedial Investigation is underway, with an initial round of supplemental sampling for the RI completed in 2020 and hydraulic and hydrologic watershed data gathering and modelling in 2021. Additional watershed-wide surface water, sediment and floodplain soil sampling will be completed in an ongoing RIFS.

**OU8 - Railroad Lines** \- Railroad Lines were added as an operable unit to the Madison County Mines site in 2021. EPA is considering a consolidated effort to address all of the abandoned railroad lines in the southeast Missouri Old Lead Belt, which also includes railroad lines in Jefferson County, Madison County, the Big River Mining Site and the Washington County Lead District (Richwoods, Old Mines, Furnace Creek and Potosi sites). The EPA will attempt to gain access in other locations and contact the rail line owners through site counsel. This OU likely represents a relatively low risk due to few receptors and generally localized contamination along the rail lines.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through the removal of lead-contaminated soil and the replacement with clean backfill and topsoil at residential properties. Mine waste locations are also being addressed in a phased approach through grading and capping as Records of Decision are developed for those areas. A Health Education Program and a Voluntary Institutional Program (VICP) have been implemented through cooperative agreements with the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services and managed through the Madison County Health Department to raise public awareness of the presence of lead and its impact to human health and the environment. The VICP has been implemented to monitor ground disturbance activities at any location throughout Madison County and provide sampling, training and assistance to the citizens, public utilities and contractors to ensure proper handling and disposal of contamination designed to prevent the future spread of lead contamination and protecting the properties that have been cleaned up.

The EPA became involved with the MoDNR concerning preliminary characterization of the site beginning in the late 1980s. In the mid-to-late 1990s, some children living in and around mine waste locations were determined by testing to exhibit elevated blood-lead levels. The EPA responded with removal assessment activities in early 2000, implementing time-critical removal actions at residential properties. Based on the preliminary assessment and site investigation results, the site was added to the National Priorities List in 2003. Removal assessment and removal action activities expanded throughout the entire county where it was determined approximately 42 percent of residential properties, which includes public use and child high-use areas such day care facilities, parks and greenways, were contaminated. Removal actions were discontinued in 2006 with 813 properties remediated. Remedial action began in 2008 under an Interim Record of Decision and continued through 2012 where an additional 880 properties were remediated. The Final Record of Decision for OU3 was completed in 2014, and 84 properties were cleaned up in 2016. 382 residential properties have been cleaned up since November 2017 through a site specific remediation contract that ended in late 2020. The EPA completed removal of lead contamination at the SBarF Scout Ranch in early 2021. A supplemental residential cleanup contract will be awarded as additional eligible residential properties are identified. Mine waste piles have been removed at the Basler subsite of OU1 and the Little Saint Francis River tailings pile subsite of OU5, and the Harmony Lake mine waste pile has been consolidated and capped. The Conrad/Ruth Mine Operable Unit (OU4) was completed in 2018 and was transferred to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MoDNR) for long-term operation and maintenance in 2019, and cleanup at the Skaggs Tailings, Catherine Mine and Little Saint Francis River Subsites was completed in 2019, with final capping of the waste in permanent repositories at the Catherine Mine and Skaggs Tailings Subsites completed in 2020 and transfer to the MoDNR for long term operation and maintenance in 2021. Missouri Mining Investments LLC purchased the tract of land at OU2 formerly owned by the Anschutz Mining Corporation in 2018 and entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA in February 2019 to perform supplemental characterization of environmental contamination within their property boundaries and to consolidate and cap the waste as a Time-Critical Removal Action. That waste consolidation and capping began in early 2020 and is planned for completion in 2023.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

OU1, the Mine La Motte area - Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) activities remain ongoing as part of a combined OU RI/FS. The EPA performed an evaluation of Potentially Responsible Parties that concluded in 2019. This evaluation has informed the decision to begin an EPA-lead RI/FS evaluation of the Operable Unit in 2022, which is ongoing and should continue through 2025.

OU2, the former Madison Mine - The EPA has communicated with PRPs and is in the process of establishing their involvement to complete an RI/FS. Missouri Mining Investments LLC purchased the tract of land at OU2 formerly owned by the Anschutz Mining Corporation in 2018 and entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA in February 2019 to perform supplemental characterization of environmental contamination within their property boundaries and to consolidate and cap the waste as a Time-Critical Removal Action. That Time-Critical Removal Action is underway and scheduled for completion in 2023. The EPA performed an extensive evaluation of Potentially Responsible Parties that concluded in 2019 and will inform future negotiations for additional RI/FS evaluation of the Operable Unit. The EPA has been gathering historical information through its CERCLA 104(e) authority to support negotiations with the Potentially Responsible Parties to undertake site RI activities.

OU3, residential and public use areas - EPA removal and remedial actions have sampled over 5,700 residential properties and remediated over 2110 residential properties to date. Cleanup of lead contamination at the SBarF Scout Ranch was completed in Spring 2021 and remediation of the Mine LaMotte recreation area began in 2024. The current phase of residential cleanup, which began in 2015, was largely completed by late 2020 using site-specific contracts. A further clean up effort to address residential properties, in partnership with the Corps of Engineers, began in 2023, and will extend through 2027. This site is one of many across the country to receive funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which invested $3.5 billion in environmental remediation at Superfund sites on the National Priorities List. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding will be used to remove lead contaminated soil from residential yards in Madison County and restore them to their original condition. Beyond 2027, it is anticipated that future cleanup contracts may be necessary if additional eligible properties are identified. Residential soil is currently being consolidated on private property on the northeastern end of the Mine La Motte tailings pile.

OU4, the Conrad subsite - The Record of Decision was signed in 2011 with a remedy to consolidate and cap mine waste and address downstream floodplain and sediments and right-of-ways. The site was also used by the EPA's contractors as a residential soils repository through 2016. Consolidation of contamination at OU4, including downstream sediments and floodplain deposits began in 2015 and was completed in 2018. OU4 was transferred to MoDNR for long-term operation and maintenance in September 2019.

OU5, Catherine Mine, Skaggs Tailings Pile, Little Saint Francis River Tailings Pile and Mill - A focused FS and ROD were completed in 2012, and the RD was completed in 2014. Remedial action was completed in 2020, consisting of consolidation and capping of wastes at the Catherine Mine and Skaggs Tailings Pile Subsites. Those permanent soil repositories were transferred to the MoDNR for long-term operation and maintenance in 2021.

OU6, Silver Mines - The U.S. Forest Service has reportedly covered areas of soil contamination and chat at picnic and campgrounds on National Forest properties. The EPA and USFS entered a Memorandum of Understanding in December 2020 that defers assessment and removal action cleanup activities of mine waste impacts on USFS lands to USFS with coordination between the USFS and the EPA. The EPA has agreed to defer investigation activities and development of a final cleanup decision while USFS pursues ongoing removal action activities which will ulitmately be incorporated into the EPA's work.

OU7, Little Saint Francis River Watershed - The OU7 RI/FS was initiated in September 2015 with the development of a Watershed Master Plan implemented through a cooperative agreement between the EPA and Madison County. The EPA's Office of Research and Development was contracted to develop a watershed physical model, and has separately conducted an evaluation of the feasibility of constructing a repository for contaminated sediments on city of Fredericktown property west of the City Lake. The United States Geological Survey performed a geophysical survey to evaluate the preliminary suitability of the site in summer 2018. RI activities are ongoing, with the first phase of watershed-wide RI sampling completed in late 2020, hydraulic and hydrologic watershed data gathering and modeling in 2021. Additional watershed-wide sampling of surface water, sediment and floodplain soils continued through late 2023.

OU8 - Railroad Lines - The EPA is in the process of verifying Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) for abandoned, contaminated rail lines in Madison County.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

A Missouri Uniform Environmental Covenant was filed for the Conrad Repository property in 2019. That covenant includes activity and use limitations intended to protect the capped soil repository and prevent human and ecological exposure waste in the repository. Activity and use limitations include limitations on disturbance of soil within the repository, limitations on the drilling of new water wells within and around the repository and prohibition of use of the property for residential purposes.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Sampling of residential properties to identify lead concentrations of greater than 400 ppm continues. Since 2003 over 5000 properties have been tested.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 2003, the EPA removed soils exceeding maximum contaminant levels (MCLs). The EPA also cleaned up over 800 residential properties with contaminated soils. A Time-Critical Removal Action to consolidate and cover surface contamination on the Missouri Mining Investments property (aka Madison Mine and Anschutz Mine) began in 2020. A Removal Action was conducted in 2024 to remove lead contaminated soil at the playground of the Mine La Motte Recreation Area.
