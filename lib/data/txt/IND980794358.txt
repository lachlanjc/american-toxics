### Background

In 1983, EPA identified groundwater contamination likely from nearby industrial operations. The same year, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL). Under EPA oversight, the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) installed a groundwater extraction system and an air stripper system, and constructed a soil vapor extraction (SVE) system. The SVE system achieved cleanup goals in 2000.

The Main Street Well Field site consists of 15 wells on 10 acres of land in Elkhart, Indiana. It is the largest of the three well fields owned by the City of Elkhart. It supplies about 70 percent of Elkhart’s public drinking water supplies. Groundwater contamination – volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including trichloroethylene (TCE) – was found in 1981. Following cleanup, groundwater monitoring is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

The site’s remedy included installing an alternative water supply, an air stripper, a soil vapor extraction system, interceptor wells, groundwater monitoring and long-term controls that protect the City of Elkhart's well field and aquifer.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires ongoing operation and maintenance activities, including groundwater monitoring, and additional land use restrictions on one or two properties east of the well field. The next five-year review for the site is due in 2027.
