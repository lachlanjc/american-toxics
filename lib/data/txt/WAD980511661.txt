### Background

The 65-acre Mica Landfill site is located near Mica, Washington. The City of Spokane and Spokane County operated a state-licensed municipal landfill on the site between 1972 and 1991. The landfill accepted hazardous, domestic and industrial waste. Landfilling activities contaminated soil, sludge and groundwater with hazardous chemicals.

The landfill was operated by Spokane County from 1972 until 1990, and jointly by Spokane County and the City of Spokane from 1990 through 1991. Mica Landfill stopped receiving waste in late 1991. The landfill received about 65,000 tons of waste per year in the form of residential and municipal solid waste, dewatered sewage treatment plant sludge, demolition debris and industrial wastes.

Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The siteâ€™ long-term remedy included components of an earlier interim action, including covering the landfill and installing engineering controls such as leachate, stormwater, and gas collection and treatment systems. The remedy also included groundwater monitoring and institutional controls. Remedy construction took place between 1994 and 2002. Site monitoring is ongoing.
