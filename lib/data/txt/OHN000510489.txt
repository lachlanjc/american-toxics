Background
The Valley Pike VOCs site, located in Riverside, Ohio, is a mixed industrial and residential site where groundwater – contaminated with tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene, or TCE – was discovered in 2013. The contaminants are a group of chemicals known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The residential neighborhood at the site has been impacted by vapor intrusion from the contaminated groundwater plume. A plume is an area of contamination that spreads from a source or sources into the groundwater. The neighborhood is located approximately 900 feet southwest of the Mullins Rubber Products, Inc. (MRP) facility and includes approximately 500 residences. MRP, an active business, began operations in 1942 as Mullins Tire and Rubber Company. The primary operation at that time was retreading used tires. In 1955, the business expanded from tires into molding rubber products. Beginning in the mid-1960s, the company focused on molding heavy duty truck/trailer suspension bushings, the product line that continues today. As part of MRP’s manufacturing process, VOCs were used to degrease certain metal parts. The site is located near the Dayton Mad River Well Field to the south, and the Dayton Miami Well Field to the west. Collectively, these well fields provide drinking water for approximately 400,000 residents. However, the drinking water in the neighborhood itself, which comes from the city of Dayton’s public water supply, is not impacted by these site conditions.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Since 2013 U.S. EPA has coordinated with the Ohio EPA to investigate and respond to contamination at the site. Results from these investigations indicate indoor air in certain residences at the site have been contaminated by a group of chemicals called "volatile organic compounds" or VOCs at levels above EPA’s health standards. The Emergency Response and Removal section below summarizes actions undertaken by U.S. EPA under the Superfund Removal Program. U.S. EPA added the site to the National Priorities List, or NPL, also known as Superfund in 2016. This allows the agency to investigate the site more comprehensively. The NPL is a list of the most serious uncontrolled or abandoned waste sites identified for investigation and possible long-term cleanup under Superfund. Sites on the NPL are eligible for federal funding, if needed. In September 2019 U.S. EPA reached an agreement with the potentially responsible party (PRP) to begin the remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) process at the Valley Pike VOCs site. U.S. EPA is requiring the PRP to perform the investigation to fully characterize the nature and extent of contamination from the site. Based on the results of this investigation, U.S. EPA will assess whether remedial measures are needed to protect human health and the environment at the site. If the RI/FS indicates that action under Superfund law is appropriate, EPA will develop a proposed plan for cleaning up the site to present to the community so interested members can comment on it.
What Is the Current Site Status?
U.S. EPA continues to oversee the work implemented by MRP through their contractor TRC Solutions. TRC is currently conducting sampling to assess potential vapor intrusion issues in residential, church and commercial structures and to mitigate residential structures that exceed screening levels. If you own a residential property within the  approximate site boundary (PDF) (1 pp, 758K, About PDF) U.S. EPA urges you to complete an access agreement (PDF) (1pp, 58K, About PDF) allowing TRC to sample your property for VOCs and find out if a mitigation system is needed in your property. U.S. EPA monitors the quality of TRC’s work by:
Collecting our own samples at a portion of these properties to check them against the data from MRP’s laboratory.
Conducting our own validation of TRC’s sampling data.
U.S. EPA and Public Health – Dayton & Montgomery County receive records of results and results letters mailed to owners whose properties have been sampled. The agencies and TRC coordinate and offer in-person meetings to explain results letters to owners. While progress continues on the removal actions to make sure the immediate risks are addressed, the federal Agency is proceeding with the long-term remedial process. The next step of the process – the remedial investigation –will include sampling of the groundwater where the vapor is coming from. This information will then be used to select a cleanup plan for the contaminated groundwater. EPA approved the potentially responsible party’s work plan and field sampling plan for the investigation in October 2023. Soil sampling began in December 2023. Field work to install permanent wells to monitor concentrations of trichloroethylene, or TCE, and tetrachloroethylene, or PCE in groundwater over time began in January 2024.

Emergency Response and Removal
U.S. EPA is coordinating with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to oversee investigations and responses to the contamination at the site by potentially responsible party (PRP) Mullins Rubber Products, Inc. (MRP) and its contractor TRC Solutions in accordance with a 2016 legal agreement (PDF) (31 pp, 2.28MB, About PDF). This agreement is referred to as an administrative order on consent, or AOC. U.S. EPA oversees work conducted by the PRP and its contractor at the site. Residential, commercial and church structures within the area of concern have been identified in order for workers to conduct sampling of indoor air to evaluate whether  volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from contaminated soil and groundwater may be seeping into the indoor air. (The indoor air pollution from contaminated soil and groundwater is referred to as vapor intrusion.) Workers install vapor abatement systems (VAS) in homes where sampling shows VOCs above health-based action levels. A Citizen's Guide to Vapor Intrusion Mitigation (PDF) (2 pp,2MB About PDF) A total of 509 properties with structures have been identified within the area of concern: 481 are homes and 28 are commercial or industrial structures. TRC has offered indoor air sampling to all commercial and industrial structures. Of the total number of homes, 95 were sampled for indoor air, and results showed VOCs above harmful screening criteria. EPA or TRC installed vapor abatement systems at these homes at no cost to owners. TRC offers free annual inspections of the systems to these homes to ensure they are operating properly. MRP pays a stipend to landowners to cover the cost of electricity to run the abatement systems. Another 162 homes and 4 commercial/industrial properties have been sampled with no detections of VOCs, and therefore no additional sampling or mitigation of these homes are currently planned. The remaining structures are properties where homeowners have not allowed access for sampling, where sampling has not yet been scheduled although access has been granted, or where VOCs below screening levels have been detected but where TRC continues to conduct monitor sampling. After several sampling events at the latter properties, if all VOCs never exceed a respective screening level, evaluation will be stopped, and no further sampling will be scheduled. As part of the 2016 agreement, MRP has implemented a pilot-scale Soil Vapor Extraction System (SVE system) aimed at reducing contaminated soil that is polluting groundwater and soil gas affecting the surrounding community. The SVE system was expanded to include two additional recovery wells in January 2017. As of December 2022, the SVE system has removed an estimated 2,370 pounds of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from soil that would have contributed to soil gas and groundwater pollution. More information: Full Scale Soil Vapor Extraction System Design and Work Plan (PDF) (349pp, 13.68MB, About PDF) TRC - Technical Memo - Fourth Quarter 2022 SVE System Update (PDF) (79 pp, 10.71MB, About PDF) has technical details and updates on additional actions taken within the Mullins Rubber property.

Enforcement Information
In 2016 U.S. EPA reached an agreement with potentially responsible parties Mullins Rubber Products (MRP) and Mullins Land Co. (MLC) to conduct removal actions and pay for certain response costs for the Valley Pike VOCs site. The agreement, called an Administrative Order on Consent (PDF) (31pp, 2.81MB, About PDF), or AOC, outlined work that the companies needed to perform. In September 2019 U.S. EPA reached an agreement with MRP and MLC to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) at the site. As required under the Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (ASAOC) (PDF) (77 pp, 10.64MB, About PDF) MRP and MLC submitted to U.S. EPA a number of plans in September 15, 2020—prior to actually conducting the investigation phase. They include a RI/FS Work Plan, a Field Sampling Plan, a Quality Assurance Project Plan, and a Health and Safety Plan. U.S. EPA, Ohio EPA and MRP are currently working together to finalize these plans.
