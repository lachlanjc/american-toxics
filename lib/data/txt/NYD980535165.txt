### Background

The Sarney Farm site is located in Amenia, New York. A former owner was permitted to use a 5-acre section of the site property as a landfill for municipal wastes. However, industrial and municipal wastes were disposed of at locations across the site from 1965 to 1969. EPA added the site to the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1986. EPA removed buried drums from the site and cleaned up the contaminated soil. The groundwater remains contaminated in a limited area on the site.EPA continues to monitor the site and nearby homes. Site contamination has not been detected off-site.

Richard and John Giannattasio (doing business as Haul-A-Way Company, Inc.) applied for a permit to operate a five-acre sanitary landfill on the site property in February 1968, which at the time was owned by Herbert Davidson. The Dutchess County Health Department (DCHD) issued a permit in April 1968, with the provision that no industrial waste was to be deposited at the site. Subsequently, in June 1968, Haul-A-Way Company, Inc. purchased a 143-acre parcel containing the approved five-acre landfill site.

Dumping of industrial waste on the site was reported in November 1968. A subsequent DCHD inspection confirmed that barrels of waste solvents were dumped in and alongside a trench in the northern end of the large pasture south/southwest of Cleaver Swamp. DCHD received a complaint that barrels were being taken into a wooded area on the site northeast of the large pasture in June 1969. A subsequent inspection in this area revealed another excavated trench at the site containing several drums. The DCHD informed Haul-A-Way that this form of waste disposal was not permitted and a subsequent investigation in January 1970 found that illegal dumping had stopped.

Ownership of the property transferred to Joseph A. Frumento and Charles J. Miller in August 1970 and in March 1971, Arthur and Joan Sarney, the present owners, purchased the land to use as a pasture.

DCDH confirmed groundwater contamination in 1982 and by New York State in 1984. After site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in June 1986.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Immediate Actions: To reduce the levels of organic pollutants and the potential for migration of contaminants to Cleaver Swamp, EPA installed a biodegradation/aeration treatment system in 1987. The system treated leachate and wastes from the original dump site and migratory areas. The system consisted of a grid of french drains with perforated drain piping flowing into a concrete pit, aeration equipment in the pit, a control building, a nutrient batching system, pumps, electrical power supply and process controls. The system operated until the site’s long-term cleanup began, as described below.  

Long-term Cleanup: After a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the nature and extent of site contamination and to evaluate remedial alternatives, EPA selected the remedy in the site’s September 1990 Record of Decision, or ROD. The remedy includes excavation and off-site disposal of drums (phase 1), low-temperature thermal treatment of contaminated soils (phase 2), and a confirmatory hydrogeological investigation. Groundwater monitoring continues and additional Institutional controls are expected to be established in the near future.  

Drum removal started in March 1992 and finished in March 1995. Low-temperature thermal treatment of contaminated soils finished in September 1998.  
  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in two stages: immediate actions and a long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.

The sites long term cleanup began in 1992 and finished in 1998 and included excavation and off-site disposal of drums and thermal treatment of contaminated soil.

A total of 674 55-gallon drums, 552 5-gallon pails, and 20,353 small "lab-pack" containers were dug up and disposed of off site. 10,512 tons of soil were treated through an on-site low-temperature thermal treatment of contaminated soils. Following cleanup, a hydrogeological investigation found that a limited area of the site has groundwater contamination at levels of concern. This contamination will continue to be monitored to determine the longevity of the contamination in the aquifer.

Groundwater monitoring is ongoing. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. Each of the reviews concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

In December 2021, EPA placed a Notice to Successors in Title on the deed for the parcel where site contamination remains. EPA is considering a Sitewide Ready for Anticipated Use (SWRAU) on the property in the near future.  

### Sampling and Monitoring

Annual sampling of on- and off-site wells continues. The remaining site contamination remains in a limited area immediately east of Cleaver Swamp. No site comtamination has been detected off-property.
