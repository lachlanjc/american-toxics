### Background

The 260-acre site is located east of Memphis in Cordova, Shelby County, Tennessee. Macon Road borders the site to the north. A forested area borders the site to the south. Grays Creek borders the site to the east. A Tennessee Valley Authority easement borders the site to the west. Railroad tracks border the site to the northwest. The site’s broader surroundings include industrial, residential, agricultural and commercial land uses.

From 1941 to 1945, the National Fireworks company manufactured various munitions, including flares, grenades and incendiary bombs as well as 20-millimeter and 40-millimeter rounds for the United States Army and Navy at the site. Operations mixed chemicals and tested manufactured goods on site. Also located on the property are areas formerly used for testing flares, a former burn pit used to dispose of building materials, and areas formerly used for disposal of various chemical wastes.

In 1986, developers redeveloped the site as Cordova Industrial Park. The industrial park includes several subdivided industrial lots occupied by distribution, office, sales, storage, repair and production facilities. Site PRP Security Signals, an ordnance manufacturer, also operates on the site.

A site inspection of the entire site, including the current OU1 and OU2, was conducted in 2001, and an expanded site inspection in 2004. Contamination of soil and groundwater resulting from historical site operations was discovered.

The OU2 portion of the site was already being managed as a Superfund Alternative Site (SAS) prior to OU1 being listed on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL). The SAS approach uses the same investigation and cleanup process and standards used for NPL sites. Studies to determine the nature and extent of contamination at OU1, and to determine suitable cleanup options, are currently underway. OU2 will continue under the SAS approach.

At OU1, EPA and the [Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC)](http://www.tn.gov/environment/about), are investigating site conditions. At OU2, EPA and TDEC are overseeing Security Signals, the OU2 site’s potentially responsible party (PRP), in the cleanup of site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Site investigations and cleanup activities have focused on two areas, which EPA refers to as operable units or OUs.

EPA is collecting soil and groundwater data as part of the Remedial Investigation for OU1 started in 2023. The purpose of the Remedial Investigation is to better characterize the nature and extent of contamination so that a cleanup method can be determined.

The OU2 PRP is conducting the remedial action of ground water contamination with oversight provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC).

**1995**  
Since around 1995, parties have conducted several environmental investigations at the site.

**2008**  
The OU2 PRP has been conducting a remedial investigation at the site primarily to assess ground water and soil contamination.

**2010**  
EPA authorized the OU2 PRP to undertake removal actions to address the metal shop waste area and the pin flare area. The PRP began the removal actions in December 2010. The PRP completed the removal actions associated with the metal shop waste in December 2010. The PRP dug-up an estimated 550 cubic yards of soil and transported the material off-site. The PRP then placed clean soil back in the dug-up areas. The removal action also involved excavation of approximately 7,000 – 10,000 live pin flares.

[Response.epa.gov](https://response.epa.gov/) provides more information about site activities associated with the removal actions that occurred in the area of the former metal shop waste area and former pin flare burial pit.

**2014**  
The OU2 PRP conducted an in-depth site investigation called a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS). The Feasibility Study (FS) laid out alternatives for addressing the ground water contamination and recommend a preferred alternative.

The EPA, with TDEC concurrence, selected phytoremediation as the remedy to address the contaminated groundwater in the surficial aquifer which has been impacted by historical trichloroethene and perchloroethylene releases.

**2022**  
On March 17, 2022, EPA finalized the National Fireworks OU1 site to the National Priorities List (NPL) through a Federal Register Notice. The Superfund program investigates and cleans up the most complex, uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites in the country and converts them into productive local resources by eliminating or reducing health risks and environmental contamination associated with hazardous waste sites. [This fact sheet](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11166324.pdf) describes the NPL listing.

**2023**

EPA started the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for Operable Unit 1 (OU1). The RI/FS phase determines the nature and extent of Site-related contamination and associated human health and environmental risks and develops a range of potential cleanup alternatives for the Site. The EPA hosted a virtual meeting to further explain the RI/FS and ways the community can get involved.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA started the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for Operable Unit 1 (OU1) in 2023.

The EPA issued a [Record of Decision for OU2](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/10985777.pdf) in fall of 2014. Security Signals, Inc. is conducting environmental restoration activities at OU2 under a 2020 agreement with EPA and TDEC.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

In 2007, EPA negotiated a legal agreement with the OU2 PRP to investigate and clean up the site. The PRP continues to fund site investigation, cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities at OU2.
