### Background

The 330-acre Wells G&H site is located in Woburn, Massachusetts. The site consists of two municipal wells, known as wells G & H, which were developed in 1964 and 1967 to supplement Woburn’s water supplies. In 1979, it was discovered that the wells had been contaminated by industrial waste from neighboring properties. Both wells were shut down in 1979, and a supplemental water supply was arranged for the city. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983. Site cleanup is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and PRP actions.

EPA completed the Remedial Investigation (RI) in 1986, Supplemental RI in 1988, Area of Influence and Zone of Contribution to Superfund Site Wells G and H by USGS in 1987, Supplemental RI in 1988, Feasibility Study (FS) in 1989, and Record of Decision (ROD) in 1989. The RI and FS identified five source area properties/facilities contributing to contamination, including W.R. Grace Co. (Grace), UniFirst Corporation (UniFirst), New England Plastics (NEP), Wildwood Conservation Corporation (Wildwood) and Olympia Nominee Trust (Olympia) properties. Contaminants included volatile organic compounds, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals. In 1991, EPA established an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD), and entered into a settlement, known as a Consent Decree, with the PRPs to perform the cleanup outlined in the ROD and ESD for four of the five source area properties (Grace, UniFirst, Wildwood, and NEP properties).

The Wells G&H OU1 cleanup includes treatment of contaminated soils using in-situ volatilization at the Wildwood and UniFirst properties, excavation and off-site disposal of sludge debris from the Wildwood property, and extraction and treatment of source-area groundwater at all four properties. The fifth source area property, owned by Olympia Nominee Trust, is being addressed under a separate settlement agreement, and cleanup of that property involves in-situ chemical oxidation to destroy trichloroethene (TCE) contaminated soils and reduce TCE contaminated groundwater to below its Maximum Contaminant Level, as well as some excavation of PCB contaminated soils.

To manage the cleanups at the site, EPA has divided the Site into four phases/areas, or operable units (OUs). OU1 is focused on addressing contamination at the five (5) source area properties through the 1989 ROD and 1991 ESD. OU2 will address groundwater contamination in the central area of the Site. OU3 addresses surface water and sediment contamination along the Aberjona River and its associated wetlands. OU4 addresses soil, sediment, Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (NAPL) and groundwater contamination at the Southwest Properties portion of the Site including the Murphy Waste Oil, Whitney Barrel and Aberjona Auto Parts properties. Cleanup actions for OU1 have been underway since 1992 and are ongoing; OU2 is in the investigations phase; OU3 was incorporated into the Industri-Plex Superfund Site, Operable Unit 2 through the Industri-Plex OU2 2006 ROD, and cleanup was completed in 2017; and OU4 is outlined in 2017 ROD, where Phase 1 Pre-Design Investigations were completed in 2024.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA's 1989 ROD cleanup plan for OU1 source area properties included excavating and incinerating 2,100 cubic yards of contaminated soils on site and filling the excavated areas; treating additional contaminated soil by extracting soil vapors for treatment, pumping contaminated groundwater and removing contaminants for treatment. More than 1,090 million gallons of groundwater have since been pumped from the contaminated aquifer and treated, and more than 5,599 pounds of contaminants have been removed by the treatment systems. About 3,499 tons of contaminated soil and 2,626 tons of mixed soils and sludges have also been removed from the site.

The site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) agreed to investigate and perform feasibility studies for the Central Area Aquifer (including the Southwest Properties). In 2006, EPA released a revised Southwest Properties baseline risk assessment. In 2009, EPA requested a separate Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) be performed for the Southwest Properties (separate from the larger RI/FS for the Central Area). More investigations were conducted between 2010-13 within the Southwest Properties. In 2014, EPA released a final baseline risk assessment for the Southwest Properties incorporating the 2010-2013 data. The PRPs prepared the November 2016 Remedial Investigation (RI) Report and December 2016 Feasibility Study (FS) Report for the Southwest Properties. In July 2017, EPA released an FS Report Addendum - Technical Memorandum and Proposed Plan for the Southwest Properties. In September 2017, EPA established a Record of Decision for the Southwest Properties, and formally recognized the Southwest Properties as Operable Unit 4 (OU4) for the site.

EPA updated the site’s remedy in April 2012 to address potential vapor intrusion to nearby properties, continued monitoring at the commercial building next to OU1 UniFirst property, and expanded annual groundwater monitoring at OU1 UniFirst and OU1 Grace properties. In 2012-13, UniFirst conducted a soil vapor extraction pilot system under its building and east of its building. In 2014, UniFirst constructed a full-scale soil vapor extraction system which continues to operate. In 2015, UniFirst installed an additional recovery well at the southwest portion of the property and incorporated the extracted groundwater into the existing groundwater treatment system on the property. In 2025, UniFirst will implement a work plan for locating and delineating former sewer line on their OU1 UniFirst property, and Grace will initiate Groundwater Sampling and Analysis Plan to support remedy enhancement evaluations on the OU1 Grace property.

From 2005-2006 at the OU1 Grace property, prospective redevelopment opportunities were discussed leading to the former manufacturing building being demolished on the property; however, redevelopment did not occur at this time. In 2012, W.R. Grace removed 862 tons of soils contaminated with poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In 2014 and 2015, new redevelopment opportunities arose for the property. In 2014, EPA provided the prospective purchaser a comfort letter outlining status of the remedy and recommendations to preserve the remedy and protect public health and environment, and later in 2014 Madison Woburn Holdings LLC purchased the property from W.R. Grace. In 2015, EPA and the state approved a Soil and Groundwater Management Work Plan for the proposed development on the OU1 Grace property. In 2016, W.R. Grace removed from the property an additional 1,500 cubic yards of soils contaminated with PAHs, which were encountered during redevelopment. In 2019, the development, called "Woburn Landing," was completed, and includes Homewood Suites & Hampton Inn Hotel, 110 Grill, Chik-Fil-A restaurants, and recent Starbucks and pending new restaurant tenant.

The OU1 Wildwood is implementing December 2023 Work Plan to optimize and expand their Air Sparge System and November 2024 Pumping Test Work Plan to perform bedrock pumping system and optimize and expand the pump & treatment system on the OU1 Wildwood property. These OU1 Wildwood property optimizations of the cleanup remedy systems will continue through 2025. OU1 NEP is continuing to monitor groundwater conditions on their property.

A total of 17 drums were removed from the fifth source area, known as the OU1 Olympia property, in 1986 and 1987 at the Former Drum Disposal Area (FDDA). EPA and the PRP (Olympia Nominee Trust) entered into a settlements, known as Administrative Orders by Consent (AOC), in 2003 for the removal of PCB contaminated soils, and 2004 for the treatment of TCE contaminated soils to achieve cleanup standards. In 2003, the PRP removed about 56 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated soils. In 2004, EPA approved the PRP's TCE Work Plan for the FDDA to treat subsurface soils contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE) through In-situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO) treatment and achieve soil and groundwater cleanup standards. The PRPs continue with ISCO treatment. In 2022, a Final Report was completed documenting the completion of PCB and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) soil removal at the OU1 Olympia property consistent with 1989 ROD. In 2023, EPA entered into a Prospective Purchaser Agreement (PPA) and past cost agreement regarding the OU1 Olympia property. The PPA will enhance and accelerate the treatment of TCE contaminated soils to achieve cleanup levels.

In 2024, the PRPs completed the installation of 30 monitoring wells, consistent with the EPA approved April 2023 Monitoring Well Installation Work Plan for Phase 1B. The RI/FS for the OU2 Central Area is ongoing.

As noted above, OU3 cleanup was incorporated into the Industri-Plex Superfund Site OU2 (including Wells G&H Operable Unit 3, Aberjona River Study) 2006 ROD, and abbreviated as Industri-Plex OU2 (see Industri-Plex Superfund Site for details). In 2017, Industri-Plex OU2 construction was completed. As part of the mitigation for the river cleanup, a portion of the floodplain owned by the City of Woburn and next to the former municipal production wells G and H, was converted into a passive recreational area, known to the community as the "Aberjona Nature Trails." The walking trails include five educational stations explaining various wetland, floodplain and wildlife benefits.

As noted above, OU4 cleanup was documented in the 2017 ROD. In 2020, EPA completed negotiations with the PRPs to perform the cleanup. OU4 Remedial Design began in 2020, and Phase 1 predesign investigations were completed in 2024. EPA also supported early redevelopment opportunities at the Southwest Properties. EPA considered the Baseline Risk Assessment Report at the time, and provided the Aberjona Auto Parts property owner a comfort letter in 2004 outlining the status of the remedy and recommendations for a proposed ice skating rink redevelopment project. In 2006, EPA approved the projects Soil and Groundwater Management Work Plan and construction began. In 2008, construction was completed, and the "Holland Arena" opened for youth hockey teams and private practices, games, lessons and birthday parities.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional Controls are required for this site.**

This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. In order to determine the current status of ICs for this site, the site contacts should be consulted.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.

### Emergency Response and Removal

As noted above, EPA and Olympia Nominee Trust entered into Administrative Order by Consent (AOC) for PCB Soil Removal in 2003, and AOC for TCE Treatment through In-situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO) in 2004 to achieve soil and groundwater cleanup levels. In 2022, a Final Report was completed documenting the completion of PCB and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) soil removal at the OU1 Olympia property consistent with 1989 ROD. In 2023, EPA entered into a Prospective Purchaser Agreement (PPA), which will enhance and accelerate the treatment of TCE to achieve cleanup levels. ISCO treatment is ongoing.
