### Background

The Star Lake Canal Superfund Site is located in Jefferson County, in and around the cities of Port Neches and Groves, Texas. The site consists of two industrial canals, the Star Lake Canal and the Jefferson Canal, from their origins to the Neches River. The Site also includes parts of the Molasses Bayou wetland that is connected to the Star Lake Canal, and the Jefferson Canal Spoil Pile Area where dredged material from the Jefferson Canal was deposited. The canals have served as industrial wastewater and stormwater outfalls since the late 1940s. i. Historical unpermitted discharges to the canals have resulted in the deposition of a number of chemicals at the site. The list of the chemicals identified at the Site includes chromium, copper, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Curently, industrial discharges are treated at a wastewater treatment plant and then discharged in accordance with a Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit. A Remedial investigation and Fesability Study was compleated at the Site. A Record of Decision (ROD) was signed in September 2013 to document the selected remedy for the Site. An Administrative Order on Consent to complete the remedial design was signed in September 2016. Work began on the remedial design in October of 2016 and is ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

The Work Plan for the Remedial Design was completed September 2018

The Work plan for the Treatability Study was completed February 2019

The Remedial Design wasapproved on May 24, 2022.
