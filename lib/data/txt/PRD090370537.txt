### Background

The RCA Del Caribe site is located in Barceloneta, Puerto Rico. RCA manufactured masks for television screens at the 20-acre area from 1971 to April 1987. Manufacturing operations discharged wastes – which contained selenium, as well as the metals chromium and iron – into four lagoons. Sinkholes developed in two of the lagoons, discharging about 1 million gallons of waste into the groundwater. Following site investigations, EPA determined that the site did not pose a significant threat to public health or the environment, and no further actions were needed. The site is no longer a threat to human health. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in June 2005.

RCA operated at the 20-acre area from 1971 to April 1987. RCA manufactured aperture masks for color television picture tubes. Spent ferric chloride solution from these operations was stored in four lined surface lagoons. These lagoons were breached due to sinkhole development, which discharged about 1 million gallons of ferric chloride into the sinkholes. Starting in 1982, the ferric chloride was stored in tanks. Process water contaminated with ferric chloride was treated in an on-site wastewater treatment system. The generated sludge was placed into two sludge drying beds and in at least two lagoons regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) program.  
EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s potentially responsible party did an investigation to determine the nature and extent of contamination and to identify alternatives for cleanup. EPA signed a “no action” Record of Decision in September 1994.  

Based upon the results of the Remedial Investigation conducted and a subsequent Risk Assessment prepared for this site, EPA determined that this site does not pose a significant threat to public health or the environment. Therefore, no cleanup under Superfund is necessary for this site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Based upon the results of the Remedial Investigation conducted and a subsequent Risk Assessment prepared for this site, EPA determined that this site does not pose a significant threat to public health or the environment. Therefore, no cleanup under Superfund is necessary for this site. Response Action Status Entire Site: The potentially responsible party (GE) has conducted an investigation to determine the nature and extent of contamination and to identify alternatives for cleanup. A no action Record of Decision was signed on September 30, 1994. The site was deleted from the National Priority List on June 17, 2005. Site Facts: Under an Administrative Order, the General Electric Company conducted site studies and will address closure requirements at the site that may be required pursuant to RCRA.
