### Background

**Current Status**

Operation and Maintenance activities are currently being performed to ascertain whether the completed remedy remains protective of human health and the environment.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) completed a [Fifth Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/06/100026585.pdf) on April 11, 2022. The Fifth Five Year Review concluded that the remedy was still protective of human health and the environment.

**Site Background**

The 16.7-acre Pab Oil & Chemical Service, Inc. (PAB) site is located in Vermilion Parish, Louisiana, about three miles north of the town of Abbeville. From 1978 to about 1983, a disposal facility for oil field drilling mud and saltwater operated on site. Waste oil skimmed from the oil-based drilling mud separation/disposal pits, was sold to reclaimers. In 1980, the state passed an amendment that established new requirements for off-site drilling mud and saltwater disposal facilities. Investigations triggered by a citizens’ complaint of illegal discharges determined the majority of the on-site contamination was a direct result of the drilling mud and fluids, produced water, work-over fluids and tank bottoms the facility received from oil and gas exploration and production. Following immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, and construction of the site’s long-term remedy, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2000.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  
  
EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

About 20,000 cubic yards of waste and 10 million gallons of surface water were treated at the site. Remediation reduced environmental risk for over 15,000 people within a four-mile radius of the site. The off-site treatment and disposal of all wastes contained in the four on-site disposal storage tanks reduced the threat to off-site drainage systems and residents.About 20,000 cubic yards of waste and 10 million gallons of surface water were treated at the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy, selected in 1993 and updated in 1997, included surface water treatment, excavation, residuals solidification/stabilization, on-site disposal, a clay cover and groundwater monitoring.  
  
After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2000.  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1991, it was discovered that an immediate threat was posed by ignitable waste contained in one of four on-site storage tanks that was structurally damaged. In 1992, a removal action was implemented by the PAB Remediation Group, L.L.C. (PAB Group). It included relocation of waste from the four storage tanks, dismantling the tanks, and treatment and disposal of the waste off site. All of the contaminants found at the site were related to drilling muds, drilling fluids, produced water, and other associated wastes such as work-over fluids and tank bottoms.
