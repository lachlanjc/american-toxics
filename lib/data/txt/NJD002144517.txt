### Background

The Pierson's Creek site is located in an industrial area of Newark, New Jersey. The site includes Pierson’s Creek, which discharges to Newark Bay approximately 1.5 miles downstream of its headwaters, and several sources of contamination to the creek, including the Troy Chemical Corporation facility. The Troy Chemical Corporation facility, which manufactures antimicrobial and antifungal paint additives and related products, is located just upstream of Pierson's Creek. Prior to the facility's current operations, which began in 1956, the facility was occupied by other industrial operators since the late 1800s. Mercury compounds were manufactured at the facility from 1957 until 1987. From 1965 to 1976, the mercury wastewater was treated on-site with sulfide precipitation prior to discharge to the creek. In 1976, an on-site wastewater treatment plant was installed that discharges to the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission Waste Water Treatment Plant. In addition to the discharge of mercury-contaminated wastewater, there is a history of spills and discharges to the ground surface characterized by puddles of chemicals on the ground, and mercury droplets on the ground and in runoff reaching Pierson's Creek.

There had been other industries along Pierson's Creek, that may have affected the sediment in Pierson's Creek.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Currently, fish advisories are in place. Because the majority of Pierson’s Creek now flows through an underground pipe, only a small portion of the creek is accessible to the public.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is requesting public comments on a plan to remove mercury-contaminated soil from land at the Pierson’s Creek Superfund site in Newark, NJ. EPA will accept comments until **December 12, 2022**. Under the plan for which EPA is requesting comments, the property owner will remove about 7,500 cubic yards of contaminated soil from the Superfund site. EPA will oversee the work and be reimbursed for the cost of the oversight. This proposed removal is part of a larger effort by EPA to clean up the Pierson's Creek Superfund site in full.  
  
The company, 429 Delancy Associates LLC, owns a portion of the Pierson's Creek Superfund site. A settlement agreement between EPA and the company required an Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis (EE/CA) report that evaluated several options for cleaning up the contaminated soil. One of the options in the EE/CA evaluated the removal of 7,500 cubic yards of mercury-contaminated soil to restore the property. 429 Delancy Associates LLC will perform the cleanup and reimburse EPA in full for costs incurred in overseeing this work. EPA is inviting the public to review and comment on the EE/CA report and the proposed cleanup.

The site has been the focus of numerous investigations since the 1970s, but actions to date have not addressed mercury contamination downstream. EPA is currently working on a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) for Operable Unit 1 of the site which consists of the Creek and an upland area where dredge spoils were sidecast. An Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) was signed with Troy Chemical Corporation in November 2017 in which they agreed to perform an RI/FS on their property. This RI/FS is being performed as Operable Unit 2 of the Pierson's Creek site and is currently underway.
