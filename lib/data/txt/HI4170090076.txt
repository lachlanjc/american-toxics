### Background

The Pearl Harbor Naval Complex site includes about 12,600 acres of land and water in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The site is an active military facility. Various military activities contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater with metals, organic compounds and petroleum hydrocarbons. Site investigations and cleanup activities are ongoing. There are no immediate threats to human health or the environment at the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed by the U.S. Navy, with EPA and Hawaii Department of Health providing oversight.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has divided the site into 18 geographic areas to prioritize and organize cleanup. The State of Hawaii is managing the cleanup of three geographic areas because they contain petroleum only.  

- Halawa-Main Gate
- Naval Shipyard
- Ford Island
- PWC Main Complex
- Pearl City Peninsula
- Makalapa Crater
- Ewa Junction
- Waipio Peninsula
- Richardson
- Bishop Point
- Naval Housing
- Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Office
- Harbor Sediments
- Aiea Laundry
- Manana Storage
- Pearl City Junction
- West Loch
- Red Hill

**Initial Actions**

*Shipyard:* A removal action at a former open-air battery shop facility in 1995 controlled dust migration and removed an underground storage tank, two aboveground storage tanks and pipes. The Navy is considering a new time critical removal action to contain remaining contamination at the site.

*Ford Island Landfill:* A removal action, or short-term cleanup, covered the Ford Island landfill with a permeable cap and developed a containment system in 1997. The Navy formerly used Building 284 as an aviation engine test cell facility. A removal action at the Building 294 slope site removed five underground storage tanks in 1997. In 2003, a separate removal action excavated metals-contaminated soil in the area next to Building 284. A final removal action addressed the slope, excavation and capping of the subsite. In 2006, a time-critical removal action removed metals-contaminated soil at the site of former Buildings 80 and 302 as part of a time-critical removal action.

*Richardson:*  

- *FLETRAGRU Firefighting Training Area:* The Navy ignited and used gasoline, diesel fuel, waste oil and paints for firefighting training purposes at this site from 1940 until 1976. Contaminants of concern include lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dioxin. A removal action in 2007 excavated and disposed of 35 cubic yards of soil.

*West Loch:*

- *Auxiliary Power Facility, Building 49:* Building 49 formerly housed an auxiliary generator and a transformer that held dielectric fluid containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In 1999, a removal action excavated PCB-contaminated soil from the front of the building. Another removal action in 2000 removed PCB-contaminated soil associated with the drain and piping. Removal actions finished in 2003 after a period of removing oil from a groundwater well at the subsite.

  
*Harbor Sediments:* The site is a large, complex estuary of about 5,000 acres of surface water and 36 miles of lineal shoreline. Initial actions included a fish advisory for Pearl Harbor in 1998.

*Aiea Laundry:* Dry cleaning operations at this site contaminated soil and groundwater with perchloroethylene (PCE). Site investigations in 1989 and 1991 resulted in a removal action to remove five underground storage tanks, a subsurface floor drain system and a drainage swale area in 1993. Post-removal sampling revealed that the soil gas contained PCE and its degradation products, including trichloroethylene (TCE), trichloroethylene (DCE) and vinyl chloride. An interim soil vapor extraction (SVE) removal action addressed chlorinated solvents in the soil gas and prevented the soil gas from migrating off-site. The SVE system shut down in 1998 because soil gas concentrations at the perimeter of the site were not detectable. In order to remediate the solvents still contained in the on-site soil gas, the Navy restarted and deactivated the system twice. Updating of the remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) for this site is underway. A pilot study is testing the effectiveness of a soil vapor barrier extraction system to contain PCE contamination.  

*Manama Storage:* A removal action in 1996 excavated 272 tons of arsenic-contaminated soil.

*Pearl City Junction:* The Department of Defense (DoD) used the Pearl City Junction site as a temporary storage area for property and for storage of deteriorated and leaking materials, including PCB transformers. Removal actions in 1997 and 1999 removed PCBs and dieldrin. The Air Force is handling fuel issues at this site.

*Red Hill:* The Navy conducted a removal action at the oily waste pit in 1996 to remove a stilling basin, pipes and total petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soils.  

**Site Studies**

*Haleiwa - Main Gate:* The Navy recommended 179 of 1,005 subsites for further action. A follow-up transformer Site Investigation (SI) Report recommended 40 of 88 transformer subsites for further action. EPA recommended two areas within the site for remedial action due to elevated concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater. Field work is currently underway to define the nature and extent of VOC contamination in groundwater at the two areas.  

*Shipyard:* The Navy recommended 229 of 1,108 facilities for further action. A transformer SI Report recommended no further action for 73 of the 136 transformer sites. Building 6, the Foundry, has unpaved areas inside the building contaminated with metals and PAHs. The remedy included backfilling open pits and covering them with a concrete cover, installation and management of land use signage, and land use controls.

*Ford Island:* The Navy recommended further action for 164 of 674 facilities. The 2003 remedial investigation (RI) recommended further action for 30 out of the 64 evaluated sites.  

*PWC Main Complex:* The Navy recommended further action for 15 out of the 141 facilities. The subsequent transformer SI Report recommended further action for 2 out of 23 transformers. A focused SI recommended no further action for Building 40. The focused SI also recommended no further action for three other sites pending confirmation of the metals contamination.

*Pearl City Peninsula:* EPA recommended further action for 14 out of 213 facilities.

- *Pearl City Fuel Annex:* The Navy conducted a treatability study to consider the use of phytoextraction (uptake through plant growth) to treat metals. The Navy issued a sampling report for the subsite in 2008 to address concerns about the horizontal delineation of metals contamination at the site. In 2008, the Navy completed a draft RI/FS work plan.
- *Pearl City Burn Area/Landfill:* The Pearl City Peninsula Landfill received wastes until operating as a sanitary landfill from 1965 until 1976. A combined risk assessment is currently evaluating the risk at this site, the Pearl City Landfill and the Waiawa Unit. An engineering evaluation/cost analysis report called for repair of the existing landfill cover, black sands area erosion control cover, soil cover at hot spot areas, a containment system for runoff and a bridge for site access. An action memo recommended a removal action as interim pending additional ecological monitoring. The Navy is working on an update to the RI.

*Makalapa Crater:* The Navy recommended further action for five out of the evaluated 40 facilities. The Navy is currently preparing the RI work plan for this site.

*Ewa Junction:* The Navy constructed the Ewa Junction Fuel Drumming as a fuel drumming and transportation facility. The facility is currently inactive. An RI recommended no further action under CERCLA. In 2001, EPA, the State of Hawaii and the Navy agreed that addressing the petroleum at the site fell under the State of Hawaii’s Contingency Plan.

*Waipio Peninsula:* The Navy recommended further action for 24 out of 178 analyzed facilities. A 2004 SI Report recommended no further action for two out of the five transformer sites. Remediation of the remaining three transformer sites occurred as part of the Thermal Desorption Project.  

*Richardson:* The Navy recommended further action for 17 out of the 145 evaluated facilities. The focused SI for various sites found that no chemicals of potential concern exceeded screening criteria at the Former Rainbow Marina Fuel Pipeline Site and recommended no further action.

- *FLETRAGRU Firefighting Training Area:* An Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis study recommended excavation of soil "hot-spots."

*Naval Housing:* The Navy recommended further action for 39 out of 817 facilities at the site. The Navy completed an SI report in 2011 that recommended no further action.  

*Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Office (NISMO):* A non-Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) action is addressing a jet fuel plume at the site.

*Harbor Sediments:* The Navy completed an RI Addendum Report in 2012. The sediment study is currently in the RI/FS phase.

*Pearl City Junction:* The SI recommended removal of soil contaminated with PCBs and dieldrin. The Navy transferred the property to the State of Hawaii in 1995, which later transferred the property to a private party. The Navy completed a focused feasibility study for the site in 2008.  

*West Loch:* The Navy recommended further action for 35 out of 738 facilities.

- *MMRP:* The Navy is investigating munitions-related contamination at three areas of concern. SI findings will determine the scope and nature of further actions.

*Red Hill:* After a two-phased RI, the Navy recommended for no further action under CERCLA. The State of Hawaii now oversees regulation of the site as a petroleum site.  

*Sitewide Investigations:*

- *Subsurface Oil:* The Subsurface Fuel Investigation is examining sitewide subsurface fuel plumes. The Hawaii State Contingency Plan regulates this non-CERCLA cleanup.
- *Various Transformer Sites:* Removal actions between 1998 and 2004 excavated and disposed of PCB-contaminated soils throughout the site. The project addressed 85 transformer sites at five installations throughout Oahu, Hawaii. The Navy used transported cleaned soil back to the sites for use as backfill. The Navy remediated 54 PCB transformer sites during this removal action. Due to funding issues, the removal action did not include all sites recommended for remediation.
- *Environmental Background Analysis:* The Background Data Analysis, completed in 2006, established background levels for metals in soils. These background numbers are significant because they help determine Navy contaminant contributions to the environment.

**Remedy Selected**  

*Ford Island:*

- *Ford Island Landfill:* The remedy for the Ford Island landfill included land use controls. Semi-annual monitoring of the landfill is ongoing.
- *Building 284 Slope Site:* The long-term remedy included land use controls to maintain the integrity of the cap.
- *Buildings 80 and 302:* The long-term remedy included land use controls to maintain the integrity of the cap.

*PWC Main Complex:*

- *Makalapa Rinsate Pit:* Between 1974 and 1978, the Navy used the rinsate pit daily to wash pesticide and herbicide application equipment. The contaminants of concern are pesticides, arsenic and PCBs. The long-term remedy for the site included excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soils.

*Richardson:*

- *Former Firefighting Training Facility:* The Navy selected “no further action” as the remedy after conducting the 2007 removal action.

West Loch:

- *Auxiliary Power Facility, Building 49:* The long-term remedy was “no further action,” because prior removal actions addressed contamination at the site.

*Manana:* The Navy recommended “no further action” as the long-term remedy because site conditions did not significantly threaten human health and the environment. This site closed in 2006.

*Pearl City Junction:* The long-term remedy included land use controls to prohibit activities other than commercial or industrial operations.

*Various Transformer Sites:* The Navy selected “no further action” as the long-term remedy for 45 transformer sites.  

**Cleanup Ongoing**

Site investigations indicate that there are no immediate threats to human health or the environment at the site. Further investigations into the nature and extent of site contamination are ongoing.
