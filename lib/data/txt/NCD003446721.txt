### Background

The 450-acre Celanese Shelby Fiber Operations Superfund site is located in Shelby, North Carolina. The Site includes the area where the Celanese Corporation (Celanese) has operated a manufacturing facility since 1960.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1986 because of contaminated groundwater, soil, and sediment resulting from facility operations.

EPA, the [North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (NCDENR)](https://deq.nc.gov/), and the Site’s [potentially responsible party (PRP](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) – Celanese) have investigated Site conditions and taken steps to clean up the Site. By treating contaminated soil and sediment, recovering and monitoring contaminated groundwater, and conducting required Five-Year Reviews, EPA, NCDENR, and Celanese continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the Site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The PRP funds and conducts site cleanup activities with oversight from EPA and NCDENR.

EPA often divides activities into [Operable Units (OUs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#o). Site investigations and cleanup activities at the Site were split into two operable units (OUs).

- Operable Unit One (OU-1) addresses groundwater contamination
- Operable Unit Two (OU-2) addressed the source waste and sediment contamination.

**1989**  
Celanese constructed the groundwater pump-and-treat system in 1989 and operated the system until 2004, when EPA and NCDENR approved a remedy change to Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA).

**1991 - 1992**  
Construction of the OU-2 remedy took place between 1991 and 1992. Celanese excavated, incinerated, and solidified 10,000 cubic yards of contaminated source wastes on site. Celanese then backfilled the solidified materials into the quarries on site and regraded and seeded the areas with grass.

**1998**  
EPA deleted the cleaned-up portion of the site from the NPL in 1998.

**2004**  
EPA and NCDENR approved a remedy change to Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA).

**2010 - 2012**  
Celanese identified residual groundwater contamination in the former waste disposal area.

Celanese proposed drilling three extraction wells to pump the impacted groundwater and discharge it into the plant’s wastewater treatment system. EPA and NCDENR approved the focused pump-and-treat system which became operational in 2012.

Additional focused groundwater removal and treatment has been performed since 2012.

**2016**  
EPA has conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the Site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by Site decision documents.

The most recent review, completed in 2016, concluded that response actions at OU-1 and OU-2 are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedial actions taken continue to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires additional work, including implementation of institutional controls.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11050317.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2016. Because the remedies for 0U1 and 0U2 are protective in the short term, the sitewide remedy is currently protective

The OU-1 groundwater pump-and-treat system is a long-term remedial action. Semi-annual groundwater monitoring continues as part of the OU-1 remedy.

Celanese has conducted further studies of the groundwater beneath inactive areas of the plant and have installed additional groundwater extraction wells to enhance the recovery of contamination.

### Sampling and Monitoring

In late 2010 and early 2011, the PRP conducted a drinking water well survey. It did not find any private wells in use. Properties with water supply agreements were connected to Cleveland County's public water supply. Additional sampling and monitoring activities are on-going.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with Celanese to investigate and clean up the Site. The PRP continues to fund Site cleanup and monitoring activities.
