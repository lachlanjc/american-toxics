### Background

The 6-acre Re-Solve, Inc. site is located in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts. A waste chemical reclamation facility operated on site from 1956 to 1980. Re-Solve handled a variety of hazardous materials, including solvents, waste oils, organic liquids and solid, acids, alkalizes, inorganic liquids and solids, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Four unlined lagoons were used as disposal areas for hazardous materials. The lagoon contents were burned periodically to reduce the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) content. Facility operations contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater with hazardous chemicals.

Residues from the distillation tower, liquid sludge waste, impure solvents, and burned tires were disposed of in four on-site unlined lagoons. In 1974, the state issued Re-Solve a license to collect and dispose of hazardous waste. In 1980, the state accepted Re-Solve's offer to surrender its disposal license on the condition that all hazardous waste be removed from the site.

The site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1983. Following immediate actions to protect human health and the environment (see: [What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.cleanup&id=0100682#Done)), the site’s long-term remedy is now in place. Groundwater treatment and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. The EPA-led cleanup involved several steps. About 22,500 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated soil above the groundwater table were excavated and treated by removing contaminants using dechlorination, and then placing the soil back on site with 18 inches of gravel capping. Another 3,000 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated sediments were excavated from wetland areas and treated through dechlorination.

Measures to control the sources of contamination have also been completed. More than 52,000 cubic yards of contaminated soils and sediments were either removed or treated, and the site has been covered with an 18-inch crushed stone cap. A state-of-the-art groundwater treatment, containment and extraction system is now operating. A security fence restricts access to the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Site cleanup has been addressed in four stages: an emergency action and three long-term remedial phases focusing on controlling the sources of contamination and cleanup of the entire site.

Groundwater treatment and monitoring are ongoing. The most recent annual report for the site, which presents the status of the remediation and provides the most recent environmental data for the site, may be found [here](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/100033239) (618 pp, 62 MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ).

A report documenting the development of a human health risk-based residue level for PCBs in fish tissue was prepared in March 2025 and may be found [here](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/01/100033659.pdf) (21 pp, 3.7 MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ).

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**

This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.

At Re-Solve, ICs are in place to prevent the disturbance of soil and sediment that may pose a health risk, and to prevent the extraction of groundwater which may pose a health risk or interfere with the ongoing groundwater remedy.

The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.

In addition to the areas addressed by the institutional controls identified on this web site there may be other areas on the property that require restrictions on use of the property that are not captured in this EPA database. States and other entities may have implemented laws or restrictions applicable to this site.

### Green Remediation

The Re-Solve Site has incorporated multiple green remediation designs. A solar array powers Site operations. An innovative groundwater treatment system greatly reduces electricity usage and chemical waste. You can read more about these green enhancements in the most recent [Five-Year Review](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0100682&doc=Y&colid=33022&region=01&type=SC).
