### Background

The Whitehall Municipal Wells site is located in Whitehall, Michigan. The site includes one municipal well. Perchloroethylene (PCE) impacted the soil and groundwater. The suspected source of the PCE is a nearby dry cleaning operation that leaked PCE until correcting the problem in 1981. Following replacement of the city well, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1991.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included replacement of an impacted city well. Additional investigation later indicated there was no further public health risk at the site. EPA took the site off the NPL in 1991. The Michigan Department of Public Health continues to sample the city’s water supply to ensure its long-term safety.
