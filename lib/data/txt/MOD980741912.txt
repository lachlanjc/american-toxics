### Background

The Minker/Stout/Romaine Creek Superfund site is an unincorporated residential area approximately 25 miles southwest of St. Louis. In the early 1970s, the Bubbling Springs Ranch horse arena was sprayed with dioxin-contaminated oil to control dust on the site. The dioxin-contaminated soil from the arena was later used as fill material in residential areas. In 1983 the site was listed on the National Priorities List and an Action Memorandum was issued by the EPA for the permanent relocation of residents at the Minker and Stout portions of the site. Cleanup was completed in 1997.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site consists of separate properties near Imperial, Missouri. In 1983, the EPA permanently relocated 11 families and the state temporarily moved two other families. The long-term remedy for the site included transport of the contaminated soils to a thermal treatment site. Approximately 26,420 tons of dioxin-contaminated materials were excavated from the Minker/Stout/Romaine Creek areas between 1985-1989. These materials were transported to the Times Beach incinerator for treatment and disposal. Following decontamination of storage structures, excavated areas were backfilled to original grade. In all but one area at this site, cleanup levels were achieved in excavating dioxin-contaminated soils exceeding one part per billion (ppb) to a maximum depth of four feet or bedrock. The singular area at a depth of four feet containing residual concentrations of up to 266 ppb remains covered by clean backfill with permanent survey markers to distinguish itself on the Minker area of this site.

The Minker parcel was placed on the Abandoned and Uncontrolled Hazardous Waste Disposal Sites Registry on June 14th, 1984. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources maintains this registry to protect Missourians from exposure to hazardous wastes and from unknowingly purchasing property in or around areas that contain hazardous wastes. The registry requires state inspections annually and a filed deed notice for the property, which allows residual contamination to be left on-site, while still protecting human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Remedial action was completed in 1997. The Minker parcel was placed on the Abandoned and Uncontrolled Hazardous Waste Disposal Sites Registry on June 14th, 1984. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources maintains this registry to protect Missourians from exposure to hazardous wastes and from unknowingly purchasing property in or around areas that contain hazardous wastes. The registry requires state inspections annually and a filed deed notice for the property, which allows residual contamination to be left on-site, while still protecting human health and the environment.

The first Five-Year Review for this site has been initiated and an upcoming sampling event in February 2025 will gather important data to support the review of the remedy.
