### Background

The 12-acre Double Eagle Refinery Co. site is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. From 1929 until the early 1980s, the Double Eagle Refinery facility re-refined used motor oils through a process of acidulation and filtration. This process generated about 80,000 gallons of oily sludge per month. Operators initially sent the waste sludge to an off-site disposal facility. Later, operators disposed of the sludge in on-site impoundments and a sludge lagoon from the late 1960s to the early 1970s. Double Eagle continued to accept waste oil for storage in on-site storage tanks until 1980. Site activities and waste disposal practices contaminated sludge, soil, sediment and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2008. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through state and federal actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

The Double Eagle Superfund is located at 301 N Rhode Island, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The site extends over approximately 12 acres and is bounded to the north by the Union Pacific Railroad tracks and to the east and west by vacant lots zoned for industrial land use. A "Pilot Truck Stop" operates to the south. Martin Luther King Boulevard lies on the east side of the site. The Double Eagle site collected, stored, and re-refined used oils and distributed the recycled product. The refinery was active as early as 1929. The Double Eagle site recycled approximately 500,000 to 600,000 gallons of used motor oil per month into finished lubricating oil. The recycling process consisted of the addition of sulfuric acid, settling, and filtration with bleaching clays via a filter press. This process generated approximately 80,000 gallons of oily sludge per month. Sludges were initially sent to an off-site disposal facility. Later, sludges were disposed of in on-site impoundments and a sludge lagoon until the late 1960's to early 1970's. Double Eagle continued to accept waste oil for storage in on-site storage tanks until 1980. Although industrial areas surround the sites, the land use within a 1-mile radius of both sites is mixed industrial and residential. A small neighborhood is located about ¼ mile to the northwest. Four schools and two recreational facilities are located within a 1-mile radius of the sites. Within a 1-mile radius of the sites are many commercial and small industrial facilities. 1,750 people live within one mile of the site. The Double Eagle site is not being re-used at this time. The site is owned by private land owners. The Double Eagle site was found to be contaminated with metals and organic contaminants in the soil and ground water. Also it contained acidic sludges found in on-site lagoons or pits. Most of the equipment was contaminated to various degrees. The chemicals of concern (COCs) for the Source Control OU included polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls, alkyl benzenes, ketones, lead, arsenic, and antimony. Lead was considered the primary COC. The ground water OU under the sites was contaminated with similar COCs to the Source Control OU In 1989 a fence was constructed and warning signs posted around areas of contamination for the Double Eagle Refining Company site. The ROD for the Double Eagle Source Control OU was signed on September 28, 1992. The remedy selected included Neutralization, Excavation, On-site Stabilization, and Off-site Landfill Disposal. The ROD for Groundwater OU was signed on April 19, 1994 and called for groundwater monitoring upon completion of source removal. Approximately 143,465 cubic yards of waste material were hauled and disposed at the East Oak Landfill. The site was deleted from the National Priorities List on August 21, 2008.The Double Eagle Superfund is located at 301 N Rhode Island, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The long-term remedy included excavation, consolidation, stabilization and off-site disposal of contaminated soil, sludge and sediment; demolition of on-site structures and disposal of asbestos insulation as necessary; landfill maintenance; and groundwater monitoring. Additional cleanup actions included natural attenuation of groundwater contaminants; institutional controls; installation of warning signs to require notification prior to drilling in the area; and contingency measures, which include active treatment, to be implemented if groundwater monitoring identified increased contaminant concentrations. Remedy construction took place between 1995 and 1999. Ongoing activities include maintenance of institutional controls and semi-annual searches of well-drilling records to make sure no one drills drinking water wells on or near the site.

Groundwater monitoring results from 1996 to 2003, results of a well study from 2004 and 2005, and a groundwater investigation by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in 2002 determined that contaminant levels were decreasing and that groundwater in the vicinity of the site is not used as a water supply. Based on these results, EPA and the state determined that groundwater monitoring is no longer required at the site. The state plugged all monitoring wells in 2005. EPA updated the site’s remedy in 2006, documenting the discontinuation of groundwater monitoring.  

Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2008.
