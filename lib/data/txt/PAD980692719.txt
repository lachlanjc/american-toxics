Background
The 43-acre Voortman Farm site is located in Upper Saucon Township, Pennsylvania. It included a large sinkhole, measuring 48 feet wide by 100 feet deep, where dumping of 10,000 battery casings took place. Battery casings contaminated soil and groundwater with heavy metals. The site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1983. Following cleanup, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sampled wells for five years and found no contamination. The site was deleted from the NPL in 1989. Top of Page

Emergency Response and Removal
Cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions in 1986 extinguished a fire in the sinkhole and removed 230 cubic yards of waste and contaminated soil. Studies in 1987 and 1988, which included sampling of residential tap water, soil and surface water, demonstrated that the 1986 removal actions had been effective.
