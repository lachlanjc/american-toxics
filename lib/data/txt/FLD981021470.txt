### Background

The Wingate Road Municipal Incinerator Dump [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It includes the area where the City of Fort Lauderdale operated a waste incineration facility from 1954 to 1978.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1989 because of contaminated soil, sediment and surface water resulting from waste disposal practices.

The EPA, the [Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP)](https://floridadep.gov/) and the City of Fort Lauderdale, the site’s [potentially responsible party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) have investigated site conditions. By cleaning up contaminated soil, monitoring the cleanup and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, the EPA, FDEP and the site PRP continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. A water line now connects area residences to the public water supply.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The City of Fort Lauderdale, the site PRP, leads cleanup activities with oversight provided by the EPA and FDEP.

**1996**  
EPA issued the cleanup plan (a Record of Decision, or ROD) for the site. The remedy included

- digging up soil and sediment
- placing soil and sediment in the landfill
- putting a cap in place over the landfill
- monitoring groundwater, surface water and fish tissue.

**1997**  
EPA updated the remedy, changing the cap construction material and requiring on-site treatment or off-site disposal of dioxin-contaminated soils from the old incinerator building.

**2000**  
A further remedy update in 2000 clarified an issue related to the initial cleanup plan, updated cleanup goals for soil and groundwater, and added monitoring goals for surface water and fish tissue.

**2002**  
The site PRP dug up contaminated soil and sediments and placed them in a landfill. The PRP built a cap over a 40-acre portion of the site to prevent exposure to contaminated soil. The PRP purchased, fenced and installed monitoring wells on several nearby properties. The site now includes these properties.

In 2002, the PRP completed the cleanup.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11166379) was published by EPA HQs in 2021. The site remedy is protective of human health and the environment.

The PRP currently monitors fish in adjacent Rock Pit Lake.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Required institutional controls are in place to restrict land use and groundwater use.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The PRP continues to monitor fish in adjacent Rock Pit Lake. The owner of the lake is permitted to fill in the lake. When the lake is filled, fish monitoring will be discontinued.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the City of Fort Lauderdale, the site PRP, to investigate and clean up the site. The PRP continues to fund site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
