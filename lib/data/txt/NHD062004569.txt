Background
The 375-acre Tinkham Garage site is located in Londonderry, New Hampshire. In 1978, residents along Ross Drive complained of foam and odors in a small unnamed brook and in a residential supply well, which prompted an investigation. This investigation revealed that improper waste disposal had occurred. It also revealed that during 1978 and 1979 oil, oily wastes, washing from septic tank trucks and releases of other hazardous substances were discharged at the Site in the fields south and east of the Tinkham Garage. The State ordered the Site owner to prevent further degradation of the surface water and groundwater in the area through removal of sludges and diversion of stream flow. Early investigations indicated that disposal also occurred into the leachfields of a 13 unit condominium complex west of the Tinkham Garage as well as into a solvent swale which drained into a surface stream and through the complex towards Beaver Brook . In early 1983, drinking water wells at the Londonderry Green Apartment complex and several other private supply wells along Mercury and McAlister Avenue were closed due to contamination and residents were provided access to a municipal water supply line. A majority of the site includes wooded land and open fields; however, a Home Depot and Staples were constructed on the northeast corner of the property in 2003 and a residential development (active senior housing) was built on the center of the site from 2004-2013. The residential development consists of about 165 retirement homes. Currently, about 400 people reside within the condominium complex on the western boundary of the Site. Additional residences include private, single-family homes to the north, north east, and south. ﻿In 2015, five residential water supply wells east of the Site were found impacted by contaminants similar to those found in groundwater at the Site. A 2016 ESD (40 pp, 3 M, About PDF)﻿ called for providing these residents connection to a water line supply and required the initiation of supplemental remedial investigations to determine if additional remedial actions are needed at the Site to protect human health, control migration, or attain cleanup criteria. The supplemental remedial investigations are ongoing.
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The Site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. The construction and operations of the cleanup requiored by the 1986 Record of Decision (ROD) were completed by 2001. The provision of the 1983 alternate drinking water source reduced the potential for exposure to contamination via ingestion of groundwater at the Site and protected public health during cleanup. Contaminated soil from two leach fields and at soil piles have been removed from the condominium area and placed onto the contaminated soil area located east of the Tinkham Garage for cleanup.. The use of vacuum extraction in 1996 to remove and reduce VOC concentrations from shallow soils within the designated source area to below 1 ppm was successful. Additional pumping of groundwater and off-site treatment at the Derry POTW continued until 2001. Contaminated groundwater within the bedrock aquifer was extracted from two wells located in the condominium complex for approximately 9 months, or until concentrations reached steady state. Following a request by the PRPs to stop pumping, EPA issued an ESD which allowed for monitored natural attenuation to reduce the residual contamination to cleanup levels and minimize migration towards residential receptors downgradient.  EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the Site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The 2014 review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.However, more recent data indicates that contaminants from the source area may have been drawn through the aquifer along a bedrock fractures.   Further investigations were required to assess contaminant concentrations within discrete fractures within the complex bedrock. Those investigations indicated that elevated concentrations of 1,4-dioxane were present in bedrock groundwater proximate to the Tinkham Garage property. From 2014 through 2016, monitoring by the State of New Hampshire detected contaminants in residential water supply wells east of the Tinkham Garage indicating contaminants from the Site may have migrated along bedrock fractures. EPA issued an ESD in 2016, which required those homes be connected to a waterline, and that investigations into the nature and extent of groundwater contamination be conducted.In 2016, a large monitoring event indicated the widespread impact of 1,4-dioxane across the Site. In 2018, residential water supply wells within the Ross and Tokenal neighborhood were found to be impacted above state standards and offered bottled water as temporary measure. Also in 2018, PFAS was detected in Site source area groundwater and in water supply wells within the Ross and Tokanel neighborhood. Under GMP regulations, bottled water was offered by the PRP due to exceedances of New Hampshire State standards for drinking water. Groundwater investigations and monitoring of residential water supply wells have been on-going since 2018. 34 households were offered bottled water due to an exceedance of a state standard. In April 2024, EPA issued federal Maximum Contaminant Levels for PFAS in drinking water and an additional 23 households were offered bottled water. Currently, an estimated 80 households are monitored proximate to the Site and 59 households have been offered bottled water by the Potentially Responsible Parties.
What Is the Current Site Status?
The Site’s remedy included on-site treatment of contaminated soils by vacuum extraction, backfillingand revegetating source areas after contaminated soils were excavated, and extraction and off-site treatment of contaminated groundwater at the Town of Derry's wastewater treatment works, which required on-site pre-treatment; and groundwater monitoring. Soil cleanup began in early 1994 and finished in late 1995. The groundwater cleanup began in late 1994, following the construction of a municipal sewer line between the Site and the Town of Derry wastewater treatment plant. Pre-treatment was eliminated from the groundwater cleanup in late 1995 as contaminant levels continued to drop. Groundwater pumping from the bedrock was suspended in 1996 followed by the shallow aquifer in 2001. Groundwater monitoring is ongoing. Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. The state issued a health order in early 1983, advising residents not to drink their well water. Bottled water was initially provided until a municipal water supply line was installed and began operating in the fall of 1983. Waterline connections were provided to five impacted households northeast of the site in 2015 and 2016. Residential monitoring continues for nearby households which continue to rely on the bedrock aquifer as their drinking water supply. A supplemental remedial investigation is ongoingand a revised remedy is expected.   In the short term, EPA has determined that the collection of data from the on-going remedial investigations and the monitoring performed under the State GMP requies an interim remedial action to minimize exposures to residents who utilize groundwater as their drinking water source. EPA is expected to issue a Remedial Investigation Summary memorandum as well as a Focused Feasibility Study in the fall of 2024 to address the need for alternative water for these residents. Prior to issuance of its decision in an interim Recrod of Decision, EPA will release these documents, its proposed plan, and seek public comment on the proposed plan to provide alternative water.     
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Institutional controls are required for this site.
This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.
The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
