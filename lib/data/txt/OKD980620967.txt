### Background

The 3.5-acre Tenth Street Dump/Junkyard site is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. A salvage yard, city landfill and automobile junkyard formerly operated at the site. These operations contaminated soil with hazardous chemicals. Following construction of the site’s remedy, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in November 2000. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions. ODEQ conducts operation and maintenance activities.

About 9,800 cubic yards of PCB contaminated soil were capped. The cap provides a permanent barrier preventing exposure to the underlying PCBs. The barrier, which is constructed of impermeable materials, also prevents rainwater from percolating through the contaminated soils and leaching PCBs into the groundwater.

EPA and ODEQ have conducted several Five-Year Reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

A municipal landfill operated at the site between 1951 and 1954. The site was inactive between 1954 and 1959. Between 1959 and 1979, a salvage yard operated at the site. The salvage yard accepted materials such as tires, solvents and transformers. The dielectric fluids from the transformers contained PCBs. Site operators drained the fluids from the transformers, which were then transferred to barrels and sold. During the recovery process, substantial quantities of oil were spilled onto the ground. In 1979, an automobile salvage yard began operating at the site.A municipal landfill operated at the site between 1951 and 1954. The site was inactive between 1954 and 1959.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy, selected in 1990 and updated in 1993, included soil excavation, cap construction and maintenance, and groundwater monitoring. The remedial action finished in 1996. In August 2006, the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) placed a notice on the deed for the site to restrict site use and minimize potential exposure to contaminants. In 2009, ODEQ plugged the groundwater monitoring wells since sampling found that groundwater was not contaminated. Cap maintenance activities are ongoing.

Following construction of the site’s remedy, EPA took the site off the NPL in November 2000.

ODEQ evaluated the fifth Five-Year Review in 2020 and the final report is now available.

The most current site inspection is dated July 7, 2020 and was conducted as part of the fifth Five-Year Review that was completed in 2020. In addition, an annual site inspection is conducted by ODEQ as part of the site's Operation and Maintenance Plan.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Between September 1985 and April 1987, EPA removed and disposed of electrical equipment and drums containing hazardous substances, decontaminated and relocated automobiles, and other salvage material, consolidated contaminated soils to the center of the site, graded the site, installed a temporary liner and clay cap, and fenced the site.
