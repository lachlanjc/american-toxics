### Background

Lenz Oil Service, Inc site is a 4-acre former oil and solvent recycling facility located in Lemont, Illinois. From 1961 to 1985 Lenz Oil picked up waste oil and solvents from commercial and industrial businesses in the area and transported the waste to the site. Generators also transported waste to the facility. Waste was stored in lagoons and storage tanks prior to sale to facilities in the area for use as fuel or other purposes such as dust control on roads. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with heavy metals, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities at the site are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA selected the site’s long-term remedy in 1999 and updated it in 2007. Once the cleanup plan was in place, EPA completed the final site inspection in June 2010. Operation and maintenance activities at the site are ongoing.

EPA’s cleanup of VOC contamination at the site consisted of a containment wall surrounding the contaminated area; a groundwater and contamination collection and treatment system; a vapor extraction and air injection system; and a network of groundwater, contamination, and vapor monitoring points. EPA also implemented land use restrictions at the site that interfere with the remedy and prohibit the use of contaminated groundwater.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews at the site to ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review in 2019 concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short-term.

Long-term protectiveness requires implementation of use restrictions that protect the integrity of the remedy components, prohibit land uses that interfere with the remedy, and prohibit the use of contaminated groundwater.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is conducting the third fifth five-year review of the site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Sampling showed soil and groundwater at the site was contaminated with heavy metals, PAHs, PCBs, VOCs. A contaminated oil layer or light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) is floating on the aquifer beneath the site.

### Sampling and Monitoring

All monitoring data is included in the AR.

  

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions by Illinois EPA in 1986 and 1987 included drainage and filling of three surface impoundments; disposal of more than 35 storage tanks; construction of an incinerator and incineration of 250,000 gallons of liquid waste, 200 drums of hazardous substances and 7,000 tons of contaminated soil; construction of berms to reduce off-site surface water runoff; and public water system hookups for residences near the site.  

### Enforcement Information

In 1989, approximately 200 PRPs entered into an AOC with EPA to conduct an RI/FS at the site. A RD/RA CD was signed in August 2002. In addition, two deminimis settlements were also completed.
