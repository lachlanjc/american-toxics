### Background

**Summary:** The Hertel Landfill site in Plattekill, Ulster County, New York, is an 80-acre inactive municipal waste landfill, about 15 acres of which was used for disposal from 1963 until 1977, contaminating soil, groundwater, and surface water with hazardous chemicals. The EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List, or NPL, in 1986. The EPA then conducted cleanup actions between 1991 and 1998, with a modification in 2005, to protect people’s health and the environment. Long-term groundwater monitoring and controls over local groundwater use are ongoing.

**Landfill History:** Carlo Hertel established the Hertel Landfill in 1963 to accept municipal and industrial waste. Mr. Hertel and, later, his family owned and operated the facility through their company, Hertel Enterprises, until 1975. Dutchess Sanitation Services, Inc. began hauling trash from Dutchess County to the Hertel Landfill in 1970 and purchased the landfill in 1975. The Ulster County Department of Health revoked the landfill permit in 1976 due to violations, including allegations of illegal industrial dumping. The county’s action and a town ordinance prohibiting the dumping of out-of-town garbage caused the landfill to permanently close in 1977. Ownership of the site then passed from Dutchess Sanitation Services, Inc. to a partnership known as F.I.C.A. and then to Hudson Valley Environmental Services, Inc.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**Long-term Cleanup:** The EPA’s cleanup goals, found in a 1991 decision document called a Record of Decision, or ROD, were to 1) minimize rainfall and snow melt getting into the landfill to reduce the chance of it spreading contaminants within the waste pile; 2) minimize further contamination of the adjacent wetlands; and 3) reduce the movement and toxicity of the contaminated leachate into groundwater, and subsequent movement of contaminants into underlying aquifers, or areas of groundwater. Leachate is the wastewater formed when rainwater or snow melt filters through wastes in a landfill; when this liquid comes in contact with buried wastes, it leaches, or draws out, chemicals from those wastes.

The 1991 cleanup plan included removing about 50 drums of waste for off-site disposal; removing about 10,000 cubic yards of waste material from the adjacent wetland area and consolidating that waste in one main area of the landfill; capping the landfill; installing a collection system for rainwater and snow melt that filters through the waste, as well as other liquids from the decomposing waste; installing a gas venting system; and pumping and treating groundwater to remove dissolved metals and organic compounds. Capping involves placing a cover over contaminated material, such as landfill waste, that is left in place. Such covers are called “caps”. They isolate and contain the material to avoid the spread of contamination. This work was completed in 1998.

The EPA’s ongoing groundwater monitoring program showed that the systems improved surface water, sediment and groundwater quality such that the groundwater treatment system was no longer necessary. The EPA updated the site’s cleanup plan in a 2005 ROD Amendment to eliminate the groundwater pump and treat system, and modify the plan to include the following restrictions, or [institutional controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls): maintaining site access restrictions; prohibiting any use of the site that would risk damaging the landfill cap and leachate collection system; and prohibiting any digging of wells or extraction of groundwater in or immediately around the landfill.

**Potentially Responsible Parties:** The EPA issued an order in 1992 to six potentially responsible parties, or PRPs, directing them to perform site cleanup work. PRPs are individuals or companies that may have owned or operated the site; generated waste that was disposed of or released on the site; or may, in some way be responsible for causing or contributing to the contamination. Ford Motor Company was the only PRP at the time to comply with the order. In 1997, the EPA issued a second order to eight additional PRPs directing them to cooperate and participate in the site cleanup with Ford and with Golden Books Publishing Co., Inc. (formerly Western Publishing Co., Inc.), which had come into compliance with the first order. In 1998, the EPA entered into a settlement with eleven PRPs, all of which had been recipients of one of the two previously issued orders, for continued cleanup work. At the same time, the EPA entered into a second settlement with eight other parties to recover EPA’s costs associated with work at the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA addressed the site in two long-term stages focused on: (1) reducing contaminated soil from moving by installing a solid waste landfill cap and other actions; and (2) implementing institutional controls and long-term monitoring of surface and groundwater. The landfill cap, leachate collection system, gas venting system, long-term groundwater monitoring program, and institutional controls remain active.

In addition to ongoing oversight of the groundwater monitoring and other site activities, the EPA conducts a formal review of the site and all systems every five years, known as a “Five Year Review”. This thorough review uses site inspections, detailed record reviews, and discussions with the operators to ensure that the remediation systems are operating properly, that the current cleanup methods are still the best approach for the specific site and contaminants, and that the approach protects people’s health and the environment. These reviews have confirmed that the cleanup actions conducted at the site continue to be protective.
