### Background

The Rockaway Borough Wellfield site is located in Rockaway Borough, New Jersey. The site covers a two-square-mile area and includes three municipal water supply wells, which are located in a glacial aquifer designated by EPA as the sole source aquifer for Rockaway Borough and surrounding communities. Groundwater is contaminated primarily with tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE). The suspected sources of the contamination included industrial operations in Rockaway Borough, including the Klockner and Klockner (K&K) facility, and a dry cleaning operation (Lusardi's Cleaners, Inc.). Following initial actions to protect human health and the environment, the site’s long-term cleanup plan is ongoing. Remedial actions include the extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater and the identification and removal of contaminant sources.

Investigations, conducted by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) at the site since 1980, indicated the presence of VOCs, primarily TCE and PCE, in the groundwater. Several inorganic compounds, including chromium, lead and nickel, were also identified. This contamination, which has affected the wellfield, emanates from multiple source areas in Rockaway Borough.

The presence of VOC contamination caused the Borough of Rockaway to construct a three-bed granular activated carbon adsorption treatment system to treat the municipal water supply. The system began operating in July 1981, treating about 900,000 gallons per day of raw water pumped from the borough's wells. Overall, the system has reduced the VOC contaminant concentrations in the municipal water supply to levels meeting the state and federal drinking water standards.

After initial actions to protect human health and the environment, and site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Initial Actions: In 1981, an emergency was declared due to the groundwater contamination, and the residents supplied by the distribution system were advised not to use their tap water for drinking and cooking. The National Guard trucked in temporary drinking water supplies. In 1981, the borough installed an activated carbon water treatment system to reduce contaminant concentrations. Rockaway borough has since upgraded its existing treatment system with the installation of an air stripper to ensure compliance with Safe Drinking Water Act standards.

Groundwater: The September 1986 Record of Decision, or ROD, called for continuation of the existing wellhead treatment system and further study to identify sources and delineate the full extent of contamination. A supplemental study identified two separate plumes of groundwater contamination now known as the “Klockner and Klockner” (K&K) and “East Main Street/Wall Street” (EM/WS) plumes.

The site’s September 1991 ROD selected a remedial action that entails extracting and treating contaminated groundwater to restore the aquifer. The remedy included: (1) installation of extraction wells; (2) treatment of extracted groundwater by chemical precipitation and air stripping; (3) reinjection of treated groundwater; and (4) appropriate environmental monitoring to ensure the effectiveness of the remedy. The K&K groundwater treatment system started operating in January 2006. The EM/WS groundwater treatment system started operating in 2011.

Source Control: Additional investigations to further delineate contamination within the immediate source areas were necessary. The EM/WS and the K&K Property are the two areas identified as sources of the groundwater contamination.

EPA selected the remedy for the EM/WS Area in the site’s September 2006 ROD. This decision document called for excavation of contaminated soil and off-site disposal or treatment, with potential use of a soil Vapor Extraction (SVE) system. The SVE system has been operating since February 2010.

EPA selected the remedy for the K&K area in the site’s September 2007 ROD. The decision called for excavation of contaminated soil and off-site disposal or treatment, with potential use of a SVE system. The SVE system operated from July 2013 to February 2015. Subsequent soil sampling indicated a potential source area that was not addressed by the previous SVE system operation. To address this issue, new extraction points were installed and the SVE system was turned back on in December 2023. It will operate under EPA oversight until the new source area is addressed.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The installation of a water treatment system by the Borough has significantly reduced the threat of exposure to contaminants in drinking water while activities leading to the final cleanup take place.

The site is being addressed in three stages: initial actions and two long-term remedial actions focused on cleanup of groundwater and the sources of the contamination.

The Klockner and Klockner groundwater treatment system started operating in January 2006. The East Main Street/Wall Street groundwater treatment system started operating in 2011.

The construction of the East Main Street/Wall Street soil vapor extraction system (SVE) was completed in February 2010 and the SVE system is currently operational. Due to high levels of PCE in the vadose zone and groundwater near the SVE system, an expansion of the current SVE and the addition of chemical injections to facilitate the degredation of contamination found in the deeper soil are needed in this source area. EPA will conduct the additional injections beginning in August 2024. The injections are estimated to last for approximately two years.

EPA submitted applications to NJDEP to request a Classification Exception Area for the groundwater plume associated with the K&K plume and the EM/WS plume. NJDEP established the CEA in June 2022.

EPA selected the remedy for the Klockner and Klockner Property in the site’s September 2007 ROD. It called for soil vapor extraction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) beneath Building 12, excavation and off-site disposal or treatment of about 150 cubic yards of VOC-contaminated soil near Building 13, and excavation of about 27 cubic yards of lead-contaminated soil near Building 12. Construction of the SVE system, excavation of VOC-contaminated soil and excavation of lead-contaminated soil was completed in June 2013. The SVE became operational in July 2013 and operated until February 2015 when no further contamination was being removed. However, subsequent sub-slab air sampling inside buildings found elevated TCE and PCE levels. EPA requested that K&K conduct further soil sampling under building 12 to look for additional source areas. Recent soil sampling indicated a potential source area that was not addressed by previous SVE system operation and new extraction points were planned to be added to current SVE system to address this new area. The SVE system was restarted in December 2023 and will operate until the new source area is addressed.

### Enforcement Information

An administrative order on consent was issued in 1995 to compel the Klockner & Klockner partnership (K&K) to conduct RI/FS activites for the K&K source area and this led to a record of decision (ROD) in September 2007 for operable unit 3, that selected a remedy for the source area. This action was followed by a consent decree (CD) in January 2010 to order K&K to conduct all activities related to the remedial actions called for in the 2007 ROD.

A CD was issued to Thiokol, the potential responsible party, in October 1994, to order Thiokol, now Northrop Grumman Corporation, to conduct all activities related to the groundwater remedy called for in the September 1991 ROD.
