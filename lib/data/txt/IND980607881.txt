### Background

The 16-acre Douglas Road/Uniroyal Inc. Landfill site is located in Mishawaka, Indiana. Uniroyal operated an unlined landfill on site between 1954 and 1979. From 1954 to 1971, solvents, fly ash, paper, wood stock, rubber and plastic wrap were disposed of at the site. Facility operations led to soil and groundwater contamination. After closure, the landfill was covered with topsoil and seeded. According to Uniroyal, some 6,000 barrels of waste were disposed of at the landfill. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1991. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and groundwater treatment are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions. Working with local organizations during design and construction of the site’s groundwater remedy led to a creative approach that addressed EPA and community priorities. EPA partnered with the City of Mishawaka to design and build a filter strip to filter site discharge to Juday Creek. EPA paid for half of the construction costs. The city built and operates the strip. This was the first agreement of its kind with a local government in EPA Region 5.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included extension of public water supplies to 100 nearby homes, a multilayer landfill cap to prevent direct contact with contaminated soils, landfill gas collection, and groundwater extraction and treatment using an artificial wetland west of the landfill.

The site was transferred to the State of Indiana in November 2011. Operation and maintenance activities and groundwater treatment are ongoing.

On September 30, 2020, the EPA deleted the Operable Unit 1 (OU1) Landfill Cap Area, of the Douglass Road/Uniroyal, Inc., Landfill site (The Douglas Road Site) located in St. Joseph County, Indiana from the National Priorities List (NPL). This partial deletion pertains to the OU1 of the site. The groundwater portion of the site (OU2) will remain on the NPL
