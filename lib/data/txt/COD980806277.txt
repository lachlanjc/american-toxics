Background
The Smuggler Mountain site is in Aspen, Colorado. It was added to the National Priorities List in 1986 due to high levels of lead and cadmium in soils. These contaminants came from the lead and silver mining that was done from 1879 to 1920. The mining work left behind mining wastes, including mill tailings and smelter byproducts. The site is divided into two parts, called Operable Units (OUs). OU1 is largely developed and includes condominiums, a mobile home community, a tennis club, city parks, and single-family homes on the edge of Aspen. OU2 is the mining area. Today, people can take tours of the mine. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in 1999. Operation and maintenance activities are still happening today.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being done by Pitkin County. The county is called a “potentially responsible party” (PRP). The remedy for Operable Unit 1 (OU1) that was selected in 1993 has three goals:
contain the source of contamination
prevent direct exposure to contaminated soil and vegetables grown in contaminated soil
prevent people from breathing in contaminated soil particles and household dust
OU1 work included:
capping and covering the highly contaminated areas with 12 inches of clean soil
blood lead surveillance program for children
long-term monitoring of soil caps and plant covers
special rules, called “institutional controls,” to stop or slow the movement of contaminated soils in and from the site
For more on institutional controls, see Activity and Use Limitations. Cleanup on OU2 happened in 1995. The goals for the work were to keep people from touching, eating, drinking, or breathing in dust from contaminated soils and waste rock, and keep the contamination from spreading. The work also made sure we followed other environmental laws known as “applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements” (ARARs). OU2 work included:
regrading a mine dump back into the mountain
regrading a parking area to drain back into the mountain
controlling dust in the parking area
extending a fence to restrict access to the property

What Is the Current Site Status?
Pitkin County is still monitoring the site to ensure runoff, dust, and site access are controlled. EPA has done several five-year reviews of the site’s work. These reviews make sure that the work done still protects public health and the environment, and was done according to the site decision documents and plans. The most recent review found that response work was done as required and the remedy continues to protect human health and the environment. To read the latest five-year review report (2022), see Featured Documents. Based on the January 2024 Updated Lead Guidance, the EPA is evaluating the risks from lead in soils to sensitive populations. This analysis will include compiling available site data to determine the potential presence and extent of lead-contaminated soils. Lead can pose health risks to sensitive populations, especially children under 7 years old and pregnant or nursing women. The process to implement the Updated Lead Guidance will involve additional planning, data gathering, risk assessment and funding requests. EPA will coordinate with our state partners and request public feedback on our proposed cleanup plans before additional cleanups begin. 
  While implementing the Updated Lead Guidance may take several years to complete, the EPA and state counterpart will share information on planned activities and results as they become available. In the meantime, and out of an abundance of caution, if you live near the Smuggler Mountain Superfund Site, the EPA recommends you have your children tested for lead annually; especially those under 7 and if the soil at your property was not replaced previously. Additionally, you can take some simple actions to limit exposure to potential lead contamination in soils, including: 
Maintaining yards and other soil cover;  
Washing hands, especially children’s, after handling soil, playing outside, and before meals; 
Making sure children eat nutritious meals high in iron and calcium; 
Keeping dust levels down by mopping and damp dusting regularly;  
Regularly changing out furnace filters; 
Keeping kids’ toys and play areas clean; 
Taking shoes off at the door and keeping pets clean; 
Wearing gloves while gardening; and 
Cleaning homegrown produce and peeling root vegetables. 
The Smuggler Mountain Superfund Site team will communicate with residents affected by this guidance about the specific next steps the Agency will take in their community. Residents may also contact the site’s Community Involvement Coordinator with questions or concerns at tribbett.kate@epa.gov.
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
The EPA, the City of Aspen, and Pitkin County have agreed to rules, called upon “institutional controls” for the site. These rules are put in place by the City of Aspen and Pitkin County.
Anyone who would dig up or expose more than 1 cubic yard of soil must get a special permit prior to starting the work. Anyone who has a permit, and anyone who is developing on the site, must follow certain procedures about digging, dust suppression, and removal of contaminated material.
Landscaping, as well as vegetable and flower gardening, must also be done according to the requirements of the institutional controls.
All areas within the site are required to be maintained with a plant cover or hard surface cover, and in a way designed to reduce erosion.
Site visits are done routinely by Pitkin County Public Health to make sure people are still following these rules.
There are no institutional controls for OU2.
Emergency Response and Removal
From 1990 to 1996, before the final remedy decision was made, the mine owners did emergency work on the site. In 1995 they put up a fence to prevent people from coming onto to a heavily contaminated area south of the mine. They also put up signs to warn residents of contaminated soils. Removal work included regrading a part of the mine dump to drain back into the mountain, regrading the parking area to drain back into the mountain, controlling dust emissions, and extending the fence to restrict entry to the lower part of the mine site. No recent emergency work involving contaminated soils has been done on the site.
