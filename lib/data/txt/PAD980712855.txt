### Background

The 6-acre Bruin Lagoon Superfund Site is located along the western bank of the South Branch of Bear Creek in Bruin Borough, Pennsylvania. Operations at the site began in the 1930s when the Bruin Oil Company, located on adjacent property to the south, used the lagoon for disposal of mineral oil production wastes. Disposal operations continued for over 40 years. Material deposited in the lagoon included bottom residues from crude oil storage tanks and spent refining agents containing highly acidic sludge. Site activities contaminated soil, surface water and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. In September 1983, EPA added the site to the Superfund program's National Priorities List. Following cleanup activities, the site was removed from the National Priorities List in September 1997.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

After the remedial investigation, EPA contractors began the cleanup of the site in August 1983. During the site cleanup activities in May 1984, a previously unknown crust layer was penetrated resulting in a major release of sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and sulfuric acid mist. EPA suspended all the cleanup activities and mobilized emergency personnel to stabilize the site. EPA then conducted a second remedial investigation and initiated a second cleanup effort in March 1989. Because of the past chemical release, EPA remained vigilant in combating all unexpected challenges to ensure the safety of the surrounding community and the environment during the second cleanup activity.

EPA treated approximately 80,000 cubic yards of contaminated waste and securely capped the lagoon area despite the presence of acids and periodic release of highly toxic gases such as sulfur dioxide. EPA effectively completed the cleanup while ensuring the safety of the residents throughout the complex cleanup process. The cleanup was completed in July 1991. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania took over the responsibility of operation and maintenance and the site was removed from the National Priorities List in September 1997.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by decision documents. The most recent [2019 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2282884) found that the remedy remains protective of human health and the environment. The next five-year review will be completed in September 2024.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls are in place to protect the groundwater monitoring wells, cap, and fence around the site. No additional groundwater wells may be installed without prior approval from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.

Additional information about the institutional controls are available in the [2019 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2282884) (pages 7-9).

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup of the site included an emergency response action, or short-term cleanup, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1984, cleanup activities breached a previously unidentified sludge layer and released toxic gases. EPA declared an emergency situation to temporarily stop all remedial activities and started an emergency response action. This action addressed immediate on-site threats and ended in 1984 following the stabilization of the site.
