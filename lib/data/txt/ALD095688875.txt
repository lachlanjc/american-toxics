### Background

The 220-acre Stauffer Chemical Company (Cold Creek Plant) Superfund site is in Bucks, Mobile County, Alabama, approximately 25 miles north of Mobile. The Stauffer Chemical Co. (LeMoyne Plant) Superfund Site is located next to the site. The site’s surroundings are primarily industrial land uses. The nearest residential property is a few miles from the site.

Stauffer manufactured agricultural chemicals at the site from 1966 until 2008. Operations discharged wastewater into clay-lined ponds and the nearby 650-acre Cold Creek Swamp (CCS) until approximately 1975.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1984 because of contaminated groundwater, sediment and soil resulting from manufacturing operations.

The EPA, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) and Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc., the site’s responsible party (RP), have investigated site conditions. By treating site contaminants and undertaking Five-Year Reviews (FYRs), the EPA, ADEM and the site’s RP continue to protect human health and the environment from site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. A water line connects residences and businesses to the public water supply.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Site consists of 3 operable units (OU): OU1 covers groundwater at the LeMoyne and Cold Creek Sites; OU2 cover source areas., Four specific areas were identified as part of the Cold Creek Plant OU2:

Cold Creek North Landfill

Cold Creek South Landfill

Cold Creek LeCreek Wastewater Treatment Pond

Cold Creek Old Neutralization Pond

OU3 covers surface water and sediment at the LeMoyne and Cold Creek Sites.

Stauffer sold the site to ICI Americas, Inc. (now Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc.). Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. (Syngenta) is the site PRP and led site investigation and clean-up activities, with oversight provided by the EPA and ADEM.

Site investigations and clean-up activities have focused on the three OUs.

1970s

Contaminated groundwater was detected by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM). Groundwater monitoring wells were installed; the north and south landfills along with the Old Neutralization Pond (ONP) were closed.

1980s

Three intercept wells were installed along with a groundwater treatment system and air stripper - Groundwater Improvement Pond (GWIP).

1984

The EPA listed the Site on the NPL. In 1986 Stauffer sold the site to ICI Americas, Inc. (now Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc.). Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. (Syngenta) is the site PRP and led site investigation and clean-up activities, with oversight provided by the EPA and ADEM. Site investigations and clean-up activities have focused on the three OUs.

Historical Remedial Investigations

A Remedial Investigation (RI) for OU-1 conducted between 1986 and 1989, concluded that using the groundwater as a potable supply would result in human health risks and ecological risk to the wetland. Subsequent investigations were conducted in 1993 in a Limited Field Investigation/Remedial Investigation (LFI/FI) and determined that there was no risk from exposure to soil, surface water, and groundwater in the Cold Creek North Landfill, Cold Creek South Landfill, and the Cold Creek LeCreek Wastewater Treatment Pond, there were, however, risks from exposure to soil and thiocarbamates in groundwater in the ONP. The OU-3 RI was completed in 1993 and identified elevated mercury concentrations in sediment in the upper arm swamp zone (UASZ) and the middle lower swamp transition zone (MLSTZ).

Decision Documents

1989

The ROD for OU1 was signed in September 1989. A 1990's Consent Decree prohibits activities that would interfere with the groundwater remedy.

The site’s long-term remedy for OU-1 include:

- continuing use of the existing groundwater treatment system
- installing additional groundwater extraction wells
- modifying the groundwater treatment system
- monitoring groundwater and the groundwater treatment system.

1993

The ROD for OU3 was signed in September 1993.

An interim ROD for OU3 was signed in September 2010.

The site’s long-term remedy for OU-3, selected in 1993 and updated in 2010, includes:

Constructing an engineered cap over 17.5 acres of contaminated soil and sediment in the Upper Arm Swamp Zone (UASZ), monitoring CCS to evaluate the effectiveness of the clean-up activities, implementation of a monitoring and assessment program in the CCS, and institutional controls to prevent disturbance. Clean up goals for the uptake of mercury into fish tissue were established.

1995

The ROD for OU2 was signed in August 1995.

The site’s long-term remedy for OU-2, selected in 1995 and updated in 1999 and 2018 includes:

- undertaking no further action at the Cold Creek LeCreek Waste Treatment Pond
- maintaining the cap for the Cold Creek North Landfill and South Landfill
- continuing groundwater monitoring at the Cold Creek North Landfill and South Landfill
- using living organisms to break down contaminants in soil
- excavating and disposing of contaminated soils from the Old Neutralization Pond at a Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) approved off-site location.

1992 -1994

To reduce the remediation timeline, the groundwater treatment system for OU-1 was modified to intercept groundwater near sources areas. Additional Intercept wells were installed and directed discharge to the GWIP, and then to the Mobile River until 2002.

A fish consumption advisory was issued; "no fishing" signs were posted along the wetland.

1994

A LFI was conducted at the ONP determined that no current human health risks exist because contaminated groundwater is captured and treated in the GWIP. A focused feasibility study was recommended that would explore alternatives that would prevent thiocarbamates from leaching into groundwater.

1998-1999

The Remedial Action Work Plan (RAWP) was approved for OU2.

1999

Between September and December, Phase I of the Remedial Action for OU-2 was completed by excavating contaminated soil from the Old Neutralization Pond and placing it in a treatment cell (biopile).

2000

Phase 2 of the Remedial Action for OU-2 was completed between 2000 and 2004, during this time frame the biopile was operated. Material within the biopile had a 50% reduction in contaminant mass.

2010

The RP decommissioned the manufacturing facility in 2010.

2012

The groundwater treatment system was shut down for maintenance and repairs. A rebound study was conducted to observe constituent of concern (COC) concentrations. COC exceedances were observed during a rebound study and groundwater monitoring has continued.

2014

A long-term monitoring plan (Performance Standard Verification Plan) was developed for the Cold Creek Swamp and includes the annual collection and analysis of fish tissue, surface water, soil, sediment, sediment trap and sediment anchor samples.

2015

Construction of the 17.5-acre engineered cap for the Cold Creek Swamp was completed.

2016

The OU-3 Cold Creek Swamp cap was completed for the 17.5-acre area.

The Site’s fourth Five-Year Review, completed in 2016, found that the cleanup for OU-1 groundwater remains protective of human health and the environment and the newly installed cap for OU-3 has eliminated exposure to contaminated sediments. Performance monitoring will be conducted to ensure the OU-3 remedy is protective. The cleanup for OU-2 will be protective of human health and the environment following completion of the remedy.

2018

The treated ONP soils were analyzed, and data revealed the concentrations were below the soil treatment performance standards. An Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) was approved that would allow the treated ONP soils to be removed from the biopile and placed in an off-site landfill instead of keeping the material on Site and constructing a RCRA Subtitle C cap over it, which was Phase 3 of the OU-2 Remedial Action.

2019

The RP completed remedial action at OU-2 in March 2019.

2021

A Remedial Design Work Plan Addendum for OU-2 was approved that included more Site studies that were needed.

The Site's fifth Five-Year Review was completed in 2021 and found that the OU-1 groundwater is short-term protective: institutional controls are needed, and more groundwater investigations and optimizations of the current network are needed. The OU-2 remedy is expected to be protective after it is completed. Protectiveness at OU-3 is deferred, as additional sampling is needed in the Cold Creek Swamp.

2024

Investigations into the transition zone in the Cold Creek Swamp were initiated. A supplemental investigation revealed that source areas remain outside of the previously capped area, and a Remedial Design Work Plan for the Upper Arm Swamp Zone cap extension was approved. A groundwater optimization study was initiated for OU-1.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

A Fifth Five Year Review Addendum was completed in 2024. Regarding OU-1, a study is in progress that will consider potential alterations to the groundwater remedy. The source of thiocarbamate fluctuations is being evaluated for OU-2. The following are OU-3 recommendations:

Additional investigations into upstream areas of the Cold Creek Swamp along with targeted removals,

full investigation into the Middle Swamp Zone and Lower Swamp Zone, and a review of the previous feasibility study and evaluation of remedy alternatives via a focused feasibility study; revaluation of the human exposure routes and potential risks in the Cold Creek Swamp; reassess the need for a surface water-based cleanup/performance goal(s) for mercury and revise, as necessary; reinstitute monitoring (surface water, sediment, fish tissue) within the Mobile River as part of the OU-3 remedy. The existing remedy at the Cold Creek Swamp was determined to be not protective at this time.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Annual groundwater sampling is conducted for OU-1 to ensure rebound is not occuring and the remedy remains protective of human health and the environment.

Long-Term Post-Remediation Monitoring for OU3 includes fish tissue, surface water, sediment traps, soil/sediment, and anchor tile samples. Samples are collected from several locations including the UASZ, Middle Lower Swamp Transition Zone (MLSTZ) and surrounding background areas.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site PRP to investigate and cleanup the Site. The PRP continues to fund site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
