### Background

The Schmalz Dump site is located in Harrison Township in Calumet County, Wisconsin. It covers three-quarters of an acre near the northern shore of Lake Winnebago. Unauthorized dumping occurred at the site from 1968 to 1979. The site formerly included wetland areas. In 1972 and 1973, fly ash and bottom ash from a utility company were disposed of on site. In 1978 and 1979, building demolition debris contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was disposed of on site. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring have been ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In the 1980s and 1990s, EPA fenced off the site, excavated and removed 3,500 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated soil and sediment, and installed a soil cover. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources takes annual groundwater samples to confirm that contaminants remain below the state’s drinking water standards.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents.
