### Background

The 96-acre Ramapo Landfill site is located in Ramapo, New York.

In the 1950s and 1960s, parts of the propertywere excavated as a source of gravel. In 1971, the Rockland County Department of Health granted a permit to the Town of Ramapo to use the excavated area as a sanitary landfill.

The Town of Ramapo accepted wastes from a cosmetics company, a pharmaceutical company, and an automobile manufacturer. Other substances reportedly disposed of in the landfill include sewage sludge, municipal refuse, asbestos, construction and demolition debris, yard debris, paint sludge (presumably from the automotive plant) and liquid wastes from a paper company. In 1976, a contract was awarded to Carmine Franco of Sorgine Construction Services of New York, Inc., for operation and maintenance of the landfill. The contract was terminated by the Town of Ramapo in 1979, when the Town began operating the landfill directly. Municipal waste was accepted in the landfill until 1984. The Town of Ramapo continued to accept construction and demolition debris at the site until 1989.

Landfill activities resulted in the contamination of groundwater with metals and volatile organic compounds.

After site investigations, the EPA placed the site on the Superfund programâ€™s National Priorities List in September 1983.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The EPA is addressing the site in a single long-term clean up phase focused on the entire site.

After a remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the nature and extent of contamination at and emanating from the site and to evaluate cleanup alternatives, EPA selected a remedy in a 1992 Record of Decision, or ROD. It called for landfill capping, installation of groundwater extraction wells to supplement the existing leachate collection system, and discharge of collected leachate and groundwater to a publicly-owned treatment facility. Construction of the remedy started in 1994 and was completed in 1997.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The capping of the landfill has significantly reduced the threat to public health and the environment. Operation and maintenance of the remedy is currently underway.

Five-year reviews are undertaken at sites to ensure that implemented remedies protect public health and the environment and that they function as intended by site decision documents. Five-year reviews were conducted in December 1999, December 2004, December 2009, February 2015 and February 2020. The most-recent five-year review concluded that the remedy protects human health and the environmentin the shortterm because the remedy has interrupted exposure of humans and ecological receptors to landfill wastes and institutional controls to prevent the installation of drinking water wells at the site and to restrict activities which could affect the integrity of the cap are in place. For the remedy to be protective in the long-term, extraction well capture efficacy must be determined.i The next five-year review is expected to be completed by February 2025.
