### Background

The 2,500-acre Conrail Rail Yard site is located in Elkhart, Indiana. It consists of an active rail yard, a drag strip and other areas affected by contamination. The rail yard (Rail Yard Area) is an electronically controlled hump yard operated by Norfolk Southern Corporation; it serves as a classification distribution yard for freight cars. Primary contaminants at the site are trichloroethylene (TCE) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in soil and groundwater at the Rail Yard Area and CCl4 in soil and groundwater at the Drag Strip Area. Following immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, the site’s long-term remedy is now in place. Source area investigations, groundwater treatment, and groundwater and soil vapor monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions under state and federal oversight.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The site’s 2009 review concluded that additional remedial actions were necessary at both the Rail Yard and the Drag Strip Areas. With the installation of additional extraction wells in the Rail Yard Area in 2012, the groundwater containment system adequately contains the groundwater contaminant plume.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

##### January 2024

EPA is conducting a status review of the site's cleanup. This type of review is required at least every five years where the cleanup is complete but hazardous waste remains managed on-site. These reviews are done to ensure that the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This is the fifth five-year review. The review will include:  
• An evaluation of background information  
• Cleanup requirements  
• Effectiveness of the cleanup and any anticipated future actions  
• An analysis of ways for EPA to operate more efficiently  
• Maintenance and monitoring efforts  
The review is scheduled to be completed by July 2024.  
Additional information is available in the administrative record on this web page and at the Elkhart Public Library, 300 S. Second St., in Elkhart, Ind. The five-year review is an opportunity for you to tell EPA about site conditions and any concerns you have.
