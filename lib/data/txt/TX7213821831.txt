### Background

The approximately 17.4-acres site consists of the Old Demolition Area and is located within the Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant installation in Bowie County, approximately 12 miles west of Texarkana, TX. The site was used for disposal of explosives by detonation.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is a federal facility. Army is the lead agency with oversight by the EPA and State of Texas. The selected remedy at the site included: a 24-inch clayey soil cap, erosion control berms, ground water monitoring, and institutional controls. The cap eliminated exposure to explosives related source materials at the site and minimized rainwater infiltration and leaching of source materials to groundwater. The site is a federal facility.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA continues to conduct five-year reviews of the site remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place continues to protect human health and the environment.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
