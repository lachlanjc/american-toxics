### Background

The 150-acre Sand, Gravel and Stone site is located in Elkton, Maryland. Industrial waste disposal activities took place at the former sand and gravel quarry at the site from the late 1960s until the mid-1970s. Waste disposal activities contaminated soil and groundwater. The site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List in September 1983. Groundwater monitoring, extraction and treatment are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA is overseeing the cleanup work being conducted by the Responsible Parties at the Sand, Gravel and Stone Site.

The site cleanup areas are separated into Operable Units (OUs) to address contamination at different areas of the site.

**Operable Unit 1 (OU1):** The OU1 Record of Decision, issued September 30, 1985, documents the remedy addressing source material and the shallow groundwater, known as the Upper Sand Aquifer, in the Eastern Excavation Area. The first phase of this work, completed in 1989, involved erecting a perimeter fence around the Eastern Excavation Area. The second phase of this work involved excavation and disposal of nearly 1200 drums and offsite disposal of hazardous materials at an approved disposal facility. This phase of the work was completed in 1991. The final phase of the OU1 work was the groundwater extraction and treatment component to address shallow groundwater in the Upper Sand Aquifer. A groundwater extraction and treatment facility was constructed in 1996 and continues to operate today. Groundwater is extracted from shallow extraction wells, groundwater interceptor trenches, and deeper extraction wells. After groundwater is treated, it is discharged and ultimately flows into Mill Creek. As of July 2021, over 331 million gallons of groundwater have been collected and treated on-site.

**Operable Unit 2 (OU2):** The OU2 Record of Decision, issued on September 28, 1990, documents the remedy addressing the deeper aquifers and the Western Excavation Area. This work includes continued monitoring of groundwater in the deeper groundwater (the Middle Sand, the Lower Sand and the Bedrock), including selected residential and monitoring wells, and the recovery and treatment of groundwater. Three groundwater extraction wells and a groundwater interceptor trench were installed to reduce contaminant concentrations in the Middle Sand Aquifer. The groundwater extracted from the Middle Sand Aquifer is treated via the groundwater treatment system that was constructed under OU1 activities. Since the investigation performed in the Western Excavation Area provided no evidence of waste disposal activities, no further response actions are necessary in this area and the focus of the remedial actions are on the Eastern Excavation Area.

**Operable Unit 3 (OU3):** The OU3 Record of Decision, issued on October 25, 2002, documents the remedy addressing contaminated soils, sediments, and shallow groundwater. The existing groundwater extraction system was augmented under OU3 with the construction of an additional groundwater interceptor trench. In 2010, the most highly contaminated soil was excavated and treated on-site using thermal desorption. Thermal desorption removes organic contaminants from soil, sludge, or sediment by heat to evaporate the contaminants. A total of 57,500 tons of contaminated soil were treated and backfilled on-site. An additional ~10,000 tons of contaminated soil and waste were shipped off-site to approved hazardous waste disposal facilities. Afterward, the site was graded and seeded. Subsequently, a bioventing system was installed and operated at the site from 2011 through 2016 to stimulate biodegradation of contaminants remaining in the soil at relatively low concentrations.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Monitoring of the system and treatment of soil and groundwater are ongoing.

The final component of the groundwater cleanup began in March 2020. The goal of this work was to reduce the remaining contaminant concentrations in shallow groundwater by conducting a series of groundwater injections. Groundwater injections are being conducted in two phases. The first phase involved injecting a chemical oxidant into the groundwater and was completed in April 2020. Chemical oxidation uses chemicals called “oxidants” to help change harmful contaminants into less toxic ones. The chemical oxidant primarily targets contaminants such as 1,4-dioxane and chlorobenzene, but it may also reduce concentrations of tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE). Groundwater performance monitoring following the injections showed an overall 93% reduction in contaminant concentrations.

The second phase of groundwater injections was implemented in September 2021. The second phase of the cleanup used bioremediation to further reduce contaminant concentrations to site cleanup goals. Bioremediation is an engineered technology that modifies environmental conditions (physical, chemical, biochemical, or microbiological) to encourage micro-organisms to destroy or detoxify contaminants in the environment.

Operation of the current groundwater extraction and treatment system will continue to operate and residential well sampling will continue to be conducted until groundwater is restored.

### Enforcement Information

In 1988, a group of 40 potentially responsible parties (PRPs) signed a consent decree with EPA, agreeing to perform the site cleanup work.
