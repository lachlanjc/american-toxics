Background
The 12-acre former Beckman Instruments plant was located at 167 West Poplar Avenue in Porterville, California. The plant was shut down in 2017. Beckman Instruments, now operating as Beckman Coulter, Inc. (BCI), started manufacturing electronic equipment assemblies and printed circuit boards in Porterville in 1967. Industrial processes used at the plant included electroplating and degreasing. Past processes and materials handling at the Beckman plant were responsible for lead contamination in soil at the plant. From 1975 until early 1983, waste discharged to an on‐site evaporation pond resulted in groundwater becoming contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), primarily 1,1-dichloroethene. This contaminated groundwater migrated beyond the boundaries of the plant property. Top of Page
