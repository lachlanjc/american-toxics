### Background

The Ashland/Northern States Power Lakefront site sits on the shore of Chequamegon Bay, Lake Superior, in northern Wisconsin. The site is made up of several properties including those owned by Northern States Power Co. of Wisconsin (d/b/a Xcel Energy), Canadian National Railroad and the city of Ashland. Sixteen acres of contaminated lake sediment just off-shore are also part of the site.

The near-shore portion of the site was formed by the placement of fill consisting of sawdust, wood and wood waste, demolition debris, and other waste material. A former manufactured gas plant sits atop a bluff and now houses a system to pump out and treat oil and tar from underlying groundwater. Contaminants found in sediment, groundwater, soil and a buried ravine include tar, oil and other waste consisting of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, and metals. Soil, groundwater, and an adjacent residential area are contaminated.

Because groundwater is contaminated at levels of health concern, two artesian wells have been closed as a precautionary measure. Access to a portion of the bay and shore is restricted to boats and swimmers because when sediment is agitated, oil and tar can be released causing a slick to form. The contaminants can cause skin irritation and increased sensitivity to the sun.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Phase 2, the full-scale wet dredge cleanup in the Chequamegon Bay, was completed in 2018. This cleanup involved dredging contaminated sediment from 16 acres of the Chequamegon Bay.

A document called an [explanation of significant differences was signed in December 2016](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/928463.pdf) [(](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/928463.pdf) PDF) (50 pp, 2.2MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) which changed the sediment cleanup from dry to wet dredging. A 2016 pilot study showed that wet dredging would meet specific cleanup requirements.

Phase 1, soil and groundwater cleanup under the former gas plant and Kreher Park, was completed in 2016. This entailed removing contaminated soil and then covering the area with clean material. Barriers were installed to stop groundwater from moving outside the park. Certain areas were covered with clay/asphalt to limit rain and snowmelt from seeping through the ground. A metal “wall” was built along the shoreline to contain the groundwater before it was treated (cleaned) and discharged back into the Chequamegon Bay.

A permanent breakwater barrier was built in 2015 in the bay to control wave action during the wet dredge pilot study.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has completed a [five-year review of the Ashland site (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/949411.pdf) (72 pp, 5.17 MB) The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This was the first review of the site.

This review included an evaluation of background information, cleanup requirements, effectiveness of the cleanup, and maintenance and monitoring efforts. It also looked at ways to operate more efficiently.

The review found the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. The next scheduled review will be in 2024.

### Enforcement Information

There have been several legal agreements between EPA and Northern States Power Co. of Wisconsin. Four agreements called administrative orders on consent were signed in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 to study and run pilot tests at the site. Two other agreements called consent decrees for the design and cleanup of Phase 1 and Phase 2 were also entered in federal court in 2012 and 2017.
