Background
The Jones Road Ground Water Plume site is located in the northwest portion of Harris County, Texas.  The source of Site contamination is the former Bell Dry Cleaners facility, which was located within the Cypress Shopping Center at 11600 Jones Road, approximately one-half mile north of the intersection of Jones Road and FM 1960, outside the city limits of northwest Houston, Texas. The Cypress Shopping Center was constructed in 1984, and the former Bell facility began dry cleaning operations sometime in 1988. The former Bell facility continued operating through May 2002 when the dry cleaning operations were shut down. The hazardous substances present at the Site include tetrachloroethylene, also known as perchloroethylene (PCE), and related breakdown products, trichloroethylene (TCE), 1,2-dichloroethylene (DCE), and vinyl chloride (VC). The area around the Site is characterized by residential, commercial, and light industrial development. Residential development has been active since the 1960s effectively eliminating wildlife habitat from the area. Jones Road is the principal north-south corridor through the area, and FM 1960 (approximately one-half mile to the south) provides a southwest-northeast corridor. Commercial development is dominant along Jones Road with residential and limited commercial development along the side streets. Cypress Creek is located approximately one mile to the northwest of the subject area, and White Oak Bayou is located approximately 3,500 feet to the south. Benefits    Providing an alternate drinking water source to the community is an integral strategy to protect human health as well as conduct future remediation and restoration of the Chicot aquifer. Continuous use of private water wells may inhibit the effectiveness of aquifer restoration. National Priorities Listing (NPL) History    NPL Inclusion Proposal Date:  April 30, 2003

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The EPA conducted a time-critical removal action that included the installation of a water line and connections to homes and businesses at the Site. Construction of the water line began in January 2008 and was completed in November 2008. A total of 144 service connections were completed. The waterline is serviced by the White Oak Bend Municipal Utility District. The Record of Decision (ROD) for the Site was signed on September 23, 2010, and sets forth the selected remedy for the Site. The Selected Remedy as described in the ROD is In-Situ Enhancements to Pump and Treat. The in-situ treatments involve treating the soil and groundwater without removing them.  The EPA completed field work in October 2011, to address data gaps remaining from the first Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study. Based on that work through October 2011, an unsaturated zone, from approximately 60-110’ below ground surface, was found to contain significant vapor-phase concentrations of site contaminants.  The EPA received funding to plug and abandon the water wells of customers who were connected to the water line installed by EPA in 2008.   Plugging and abandonment of the water wells began on October 27, 2011, and was completed on November 17, 2011. The EPA completed investigation of the extent of the Deep Unsaturated Chicot Sand vapor-phase contamination in March 2012, with a pilot test confirming that a soil vapor extraction approach would effectively reduce the vapor mass. The EPA completed an Optimization Review for the Site in August 2014 which identified work needed to define the extent of contamination for the deep Chicot groundwater zone relevant to design/construction of the remedy. That work is ongoing. The August 2014 Optimization Review recommended that the remedial action prioritize the source mitigation of two zones of soil vapor-phase contaminants contributing to the deep Chicot groundwater contamination and initiate the in-situ bioremediation (ISB) of the Shallow Water -Bearing Zone, the third source contributing to the deeper migration of contaminants. The Optimization Review concluded that addressing the continuing sources for contaminants to the dissolved phase ground water will be more cost-effective at this time, with long-ranging benefits over time. The source mitigation of the two soil vapor sources is the focus of the ROD Amendment #1 for the site. I﻿n-situ bio-remediation (ISB) for the Shallow WBZ selected in the 2010 ROD was initiated in January 2016 with the injection of amendments to support enhanced reductive dechlorination (ERD) to degrade the Site contaminants.  This was followed up by hot spot treatments in March 2018. . Sampling shows a successful reduction in chemical contaminat levels in the shallow groundwater. In May 2018, EPA installed indoor exhaust systems in three of the suites in the Cypress Shopping Center to remove chemical contaminants that migrated into the building from the soils below. Sampling conducted after the exhaust systems were installed shows the contaminant levels in the indoor air have returned to safe levels. The ROD Amendment #1 for the Site was signed on September 29, 2017 which focuses on the source mitigation of the two soil vapor sources - the shallow source area soil and the deep unsaturated Chicot sand.  The Remedial Design for the Soil Vapor Extraction System was completed in September 2018.  The fieldwork for the SVE system began in April, 2019.  The SVE system began operations in July 2019 and continues to operated. Remedial action for the Deep Chicot aquifer will be initiated once the effectiveness of the Selected Remedy SVE in the Shallow Source Area Soil and the Deep Unsaturated Chicot Sand and the on-going in-situ bio-remediation in the Shallow WBZ are determined and the groundwater monitoring data are evaluated.  Any future need for pump and treat to contain the migration of groundwater contaminants will be further assessed.

The EPA is providing another opportunity for the property owners to connect to the public water supply. The EPA currently is reaching out to the property owners in the waterline area to sign them up to be connected to the public water supply. The EPA will continue to work with  White Oak Bend Municipal Utility District to connect the private properties to the public water supply and provide additional water. The EPA anticipates starting installation of the connections in 2024.. The EPA plans to pay for the installation of these connections and for plugging and abandoning private wells. Remedial action for the Deep Chicot aquifer will be initiated once the effectiveness of the Selected Remedy SVE in the Shallow Source Area Soil and the Deep Unsaturated Chicot Sand and the on-going in-situ bio-remediation in the Shallow WBZ are determined and the groundwater monitoring data are evaluated.  Any future need for pump and treat to contain the migration of groundwater contaminants will be further assessed.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation designated restricted water well drilling area and the Harris County well installation prohibition are currently the Institutional Controls at the Site to protect exposure to the contamination in the soil and groundwater.  Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
EPA continues to sample the indoor air, sub-slab, and groundwater monitoring wells and private wells. Remedial action for the Deep Chicot aquifer will be initiated once the effectiveness of the Selected Remedy SVE in the Shallow Source Area Soil and the Deep Unsaturated Chicot Sand and the on-going in-situ bio-remediation in the Shallow WBZ are determined and the groundwater monitoring data are evaluated.

Emergency Response and Removal
Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. A time-critical removal action included the installation of a water line and connections to homes and businesses at the site. Construction of the water line began in January 2008 and finished in November 2008. A total of 144 service connections were completed. In October and November 2011, EPA plugged and abandoned the water wells of customers connected to the water line.
