### Background

The 50-acre Crater Resources, Inc./Keystone Coke Co./Alan Wood Steel Co. site is located in Upper Merion Township, Pennsylvania. The site consists of four inactive quarries. Beginning in 1919, Alan Wood Steel Company disposed of wastes generated by its coking facility in Swedeland, Pennsylvania, in three of the quarries at the site. In 1977, Keystone Coke Company purchased Alan Wood Steel Company. The firm continued to dispose of wastes at the site until 1980, when all operations at the facility ceased. Site activities contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program's National Priorities List in 1992. Construction has been completed at a majority of the site. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1994, three of the potentially responsible parties signed an Administrative Order on Consent to perform the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) under EPA oversight. The RI/FS began in 1995 and was completed in June 1999. In 2000, EPA selected a remedy for the site in a Record of Decision (ROD). The ROD addressed contaminated groundwater, soil, sediment and the waste ammonia liquor (WAL) pipeline.

EPA revised the remedy for the Quarry 3 area of the site in a 2009 Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD). The current remedy, as described in the 2000 ROD and modified by the 2009 ESD, includes dewatering and on-site treatment of contaminated water within Quarry 3 ponds; excavation, and off-site disposal of Quarry 3 soil and sediment; backfilling and regrading of Quarry 3; construction of permanent caps over Quarries 1, 2 and 4; and monitored natural attenuation of contaminated groundwater.

The selected remedy also included further investigation of the former WAL pipeline, performance of any remedial actions deemed necessary based on those investigations, and implementation of institutional controls. In the years following the 2000 ROD, EPA divided the site into 10 separate operable units (OUs) to facilitate cleanup of the different parts of the site, which are as follows:

- OU1 Quarry 1 soil
- OU2 Quarry 2 soil
- OU3 Quarry 3 soil and sediment
- OU4 Quarry 4 soil and sediment
- OU5 WAL pipeline soil and sediment
- OU6 [Monitored natural attenuation](https://clu-in.org/download/Citizens/a_citizens_guide_to_monitored_natural_attenuation.pdf) of groundwater
- OU7 Cinder/Slag Fill Area soil
- OU8 Area 6 soil
- OU9 Southeast Disposal Area soil
- OU10 Lot 7 and nearby daycare soil

In December 2016, EPA issued another [ESD (2016, PDF)](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2239753) to describe a modification to the selected remedy for the Quarry 4 portion of the Crater Resources Superfund Site. An additional [ESD (2017, PDF)](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2247124) was issued in July 2017 to modify the remedy for Quarries 1 and 2 to allow for residential development.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site's potentially responsible parties completed remedy construction for OU1, OU2, OU3, OU5, OU6, OU7, OU8, OU9 and OU10. No additional work is required for OU4.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent [2021 Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2321343), concluded that the remedy is functioning as designed and is protective of human health and the environment. The Review recommended EPA continue to evaluate groundwater under OU6 to ensure long-term protectiveness of the remedy. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2026.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls are in place to restrict on-site soil, sediment, surface water and groundwater use and/or disturbance at the site in order to reduce the potential for human exposure to contamination. Additional information about the institutional controls is available in the [2021 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2321343) (page12).
