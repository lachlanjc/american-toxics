### Background

The 13-acre First Piedmont Corporation Rock Quarry Site includes two parcels located in Pittsylvania County, Virginia. One 12-acre parcel includes a former rock quarry. Between 1970 and 1972, the First Piedmont Corporation leased the on-site rock quarry and used it as an industrial landfill. The business disposed of 65,000 cubic yards of waste material, including 15,000 gallons of liquid waste, in the quarry. The Virginia State Health Department ordered the landfill to close following a fire. Waste disposal activities contaminated soil and surface water with hazardous chemicals. The Site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in July 1987. After achieving all cleanup goals, the Site was deleted from the NPL in August 2020.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Site is being addressed through actions performed by the responsible parties and overseen by federal and state agencies.

The Site’s long-term remedy included excavation and off-site disposal of non-landfill-related wastes; off-site disposal of drums and surface debris; installation of a cap over the landfill area; collection and treatment of leachate; groundwater monitoring; and land use restrictions. Construction of the remedy took place between 1994 and 1995 in accordance with the [1991 Record of Decision](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/03/137600.pdf) (ROD).

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the Site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. In 2005, the five-year review identified zinc contaminated soils in a second area in the Lawless Creek floodplain. This triggered a remedial investigation and feasibility study, resulting in a [ROD Amendment](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/03/2179982.pdf) in 2014. Cleanup activities in 2017 included excavation and off-site disposal of zinc contaminated soils, soil backfilling, and vegetation planting at the Site. No waste was left in place at the Site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Following the cleanup of the Lawless Creek floodplain area in 2017, all known risks to human health and the environment have been addressed at the Site. EPA considers all short and long-term threats under control.

In October 2018, EPA and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality conducted a Site inspection to verify that the excavation area had been restored. This inspection was conducted shortly after Hurricane Michael, which resulted in heavy rain over a short period of time in the Danville area. The storm resulted in extensive flooding in the Danville area. Flooding also occured along the floodplain of Lawless Creek. No evidence of damage to the excavated area was noted during the inspection. The landfill portion of the Site, located approximately 100 feet above the floodplain, also showed no evidence of impact from flooding.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the Site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by Site decision documents. EPA finalized the [fifth Five-Year Review (FYR) Report](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2292990) in January 2020, which concluded that the remedy is functioning as intended.

In August 2020, once all response actions were complete and cleanup goals were achieved, EPA deleted the Site from the National Priorities List.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

A Universal Environmental Covenants Act (UECA) covenant for the Site was signed and recorded with Pittsylvania County. The UECA covenant ensures that institutional controls will be reflected on land records and enforced over time. In addition to protecting human health and the environment, the UECA covenant promotes economically viable reuse of the property.
