Background
The Hiteman Leather site was the location of a former tannery and leather manufacturing facility located in the Village of West Winfield, New York. The former tannery property, currently owned by the Village of West Winfield, is bordered to the north by commercial buildings and residences, to the east by South Street, to the south by a residential property, to the southwest by a landlocked, privately-owned two-acre parcel and to the west by the West Winfield Cemetery. Appromately 800 feet of the Unadilla River traverses the 12-acre site. Ten acres of the site are located on the northern bank of the river and two acres are located on the southern bank. Two structures associated with former tannery operations are located in the eastern part of the 10-acre portion of the site. One of these structures, a metal shed, is currently used by the Village of West Winfield Department of Public Works (DPW) as a garage and for storage. The other building, a small concrete shed, is also used by the DPW for storage. Remnants of the foundation of the former tannery buildings (i.e., the tannery buildings which were demolished) and a macadam parking lot are located to the east along South Street. A two-acre area to the west and behind the former buildings had been the location of three former wastewater lagoons (each approximately 50 feet wide by 350 feet long), which have since been leveled and backfilled. To the far west is a 1.8-acre wetland. A four-acre open field area lies in the northern and middle part of this 10-acre area. Most of the 10-acre area is fenced, whereas the southern part of the site is unfenced, undeveloped, low lying and thinly-wooded, with a small open field area. A gentleman named Mr. Adsit established a tannery business at the site property in 1820 on the northern bank of the Unadilla River. After several changes in ownership, the Hiteman family acquired the tannery business in 1910. The name of the business was later changed to the Hiteman Leather Company. In 1922, the company was reorganized as a corporation under the name Hiteman Leather Company, Inc. The name remained unchanged until the business closed in 1968. The Company originally discharged waste from tannery operations at the site from the tannery buildings directly to the Unadilla River. During operation under the Hiteman family, the tannery and tannery property experienced many changes over the years to expand business and increase production, including a major change during the early 1900s to incorporate chromium-based tanning into the process. The chromium-based process, in combination with mechanization, reduced the time to manufacture leather from years to months to weeks; however, the wastes that were generated were more toxic and produced in larger quantities. As a result, the company constructed two unlined lagoons in 1931 and a third unlined lagoon in 1959 to hold the waste. Berms were constructed around the lagoons to increase their capacity. Wastewater was discharged via a sluiceway (man-made water channel) to the lagoons. The wastewater lagoons reportedly discharged to the Unadilla River and to the wetland area to the northwest of the lagoons (which ultimately drains to the Unadilla River). Approximately 180,000 gallons of chromium-containing wastewater was discharged from the tannery into the three unlined lagoons and nearby wetlands. Wastewater from the coloring process was discharged into two 240-cubic foot concrete dye tanks before being discharged to the Unadilla River. Sludge from the bottom of the lagoons was periodically dredged and was reportedly deposited as berm material surrounding the lagoons. The inability to treat contaminated wastewater from the tannery economically forced the Company to end tannery operations at the site in 1968. The real property and buildings were sold in 1969 to Erle Davis who subsequently rented the buildings in the 1970s, mostly for storage, to various small businesses, including a cookie company and a tire company. The former tannery buildings were no longer occupied after 1982 and they gradually deteriorated. Discarded hides, hide scrapings and shavings and other tannery wastes were reportedly disposed of in the Village of West Winfield Dump, located approximately 1/3 mile to the southeast of the former tannery property. The former dump was subsequently covered with soil and was operated as a trailer park known as Crumb's Trailer Park. In 2008, EPA covered the contaminated soil and relocated the trailers to another portion of the property.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In 1985, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) added the site to its Registry of Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Sites. From 1988 to 1992, NYSDEC conducted environmental investigations of the site, which resulted in the site being referred to EPA for further evaluation. The northern 10 acres of the site were fenced in 1994 to limit public access. A structural evaluation determined that wood-frame sections of the main tannery building and the smokestack were structurally unsound. EPA demolished the wood-frame sections in 1996. Asbestos was removed from the buildings prior to demolition and disposed of at an approved off-site facility. In addition, about 600 linear feet of riprap was installed along the northern bank of the Unadilla River to ensure riverbank stability. The estate of the former owner demolished the remaining concrete and steel parts of the tannery building in 1998. The site was listed on the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) on January 19, 1999. Following a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine the nature and extent of the contamination and to evaluate cleanup alternatives, EPA selected a cleanup plan in the site’s 2006 Record of Decision (ROD). The plan included excavating contaminated soil hot spots from the former tannery property; excavating and dredging contaminated wetland and river sediment next to the former tannery property; solidifying (adding cement additives to change the physical and chemical characteristics to immobilize contaminants) and consolidating the excavated/dredged soil and sediment on the former tannery property; placing a soil cover; and intermittent groundwater extraction and treatment. The ROD also indicated that the need for adressing river sediment downstream of the former tannery would be determined based on further testing. During the design of the cleanup plan, EPA determined that soil did not require solidification prior to disposal, that downstream sediment did not need to be adressed, and that groundwater contamination was not related to disposal activities at the site. EPA updated the site’s cleanup plan to reflect these findings in 2008. EPA's contractor, WRS Infrastructure and Environment, Inc., mobilized to the site in 2008. Over the course of the five-month construction effort, 16,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil, 8,700 cubic yards of contaminated wetland sediments and 200 cubic yards of contaminated riverbank soil and sediment at the toe of the riverbank were excavated and consolidated in low-lying areas of the site (the footprint of the disposal area is 62,500 square feet). A geomembrane liner (demarcation layer) and a two-foot thick soil cover were placed over the consolidated soil and sediment (Consolidation Area). In addition, in areas where residual soil contamination exceeded the cleanup objective for chromium, a demarcation layer and soil cover with a thickness of two feet was placed in areas with “active” exposure potential (e.g., playing fields) and a thickness of one foot in areas with “passive” exposure potential (e.g., walking trails, parking lots). The “active” and “passive” areas were based on the future-use plan prepared by the Village of West Winfield. Approximately seven acres of the site (upland and the soil and sediment disposal area) were covered with a two-foot soil cover and 1.5 acres (building foundation) were covered with a one-foot cover. During the excavation of the wetland sediment, it was determined that excavating along the western edge of the wetlands would likely undermine the stability of the West Winfield Cemetery. While the chromium concentration in this sediment exceeded the cleanup objective, it was not believed that the levels posed a significant risk to ecological receptors. In addition, since the wetland is a depositional area, the removal of the upland sources would allow clean sediment to eventually cover the contaminated sediment along the western edge of the wetlands. Furthermore, since the groundwater which flows into the wetland exhibits high concentrations of naturally-occurring chromium, it will likely recontaminate the wetland sediment. For these reasons, this area was not excavated. After the removal of the contaminated soil and its replacement with clean soil, a section of the northern bank of the Unadilla River was replanted with native shrubs (potted and live stakes) and seeded with a native seed mixture. Erosion control matting and coir logs were also added to minimize erosion during vegetation establishment. The ROD required institutional controls to restrict the future development and use of the site where contaminated sediments and soils were consolidated, to prohibit excavation below the soil cover unless the activities are in accordance with a Site Management Plan (SMP), and to restrict groundwater use. An environmental easement with these restrictions was recorded with the Herkimer County Clerk in 2010. The ROD called for the development of an SMP to provide for the proper management of all post-construction remedy components. Specifically, the purpose of the SMP is to manage residually-contaminated soil and contaminated soil and sediment in the Consolidation Area in perpetuity. The SMP also addresses how to implement institutional controls required by the ROD, including groundwater restrictions, and describes post-construction maintenance and monitoring requirements for the remedy. EPA issued the SMP in 2010. After addressing all of the contaminated soil and sediment at the site, a﻿ notice proposing the deletion of the site from the NPL was published in the Federal Register on December 13, 2011. Becausee no adverse comments were received, the site was deleted from the NPL on February 13, 2012. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
Five year reviews are conducted at sites to ensure that the cleanup continues to be protective of human health and the environment. Five-years were conducted at the site in April 2013, May 2018, and February 2023. The third five-year review concluded that the implemented remedy is functioning as intended by the decision documents and is protecting human health and the environment. The next five-year review will be conducted before February 2028.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Institutional controls are in place at the site, in the form of an environmental easement, to restrict residential use of the property, prohibit the use of groundwater at the site until groundwater quality standards are met for the intended use, prohibit intrusive activities in the on-site wetlands, and prohibit construction over the soil consolidation area or excavation below the site-wide soil cover unless such actions are in conformance with the SMP.
