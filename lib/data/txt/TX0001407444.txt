### Background

The 180-acre Sprague Road Ground Water Plume site is located near Odessa, Texas. The site consists of three separate inactive or abandoned chromium plating facilities and three groundwater plumes. Facility operations contaminated groundwater with chromium. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the selected remedy and that EPA cannot determine the protectiveness of the remedy until the new groundwater treatment system is operable.

The site consists of three separate inactive or abandoned chromium plating facilities and three groundwater plumes. Leigh Metal Plating, Inc., National Chromium Corporation, and Machine and Casting, Inc. owned the three facilities. Workers at the three facilities had improperly managed and disposed of contaminated substances during facility operations. All facilities had been abandoned or closed by 1993.The site consists of three separate inactive or abandoned chromium plating facilities and three groundwater plumes.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included groundwater pumping and treatment, reinjection of treated groundwater and groundwater monitoring. Construction of the remedy finished in 2003. EPA switched the treatment technology in 2010. The new technology will achieve significantly lower treatment goals for chromium levels. Operation and maintenance activities began in 2003 and are ongoing.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Removal actions in 1996 removed and disposed of liquids and sludges in storage tanks and excavated and disposed of contaminated soil. A second action in 1998 supplied bottled water to affected residences. A third removal action connected those residents to the municipal water supply and addressed risks posed by the abandoned plating room shops.
