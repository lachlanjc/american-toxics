### Background

The Horseshoe Road site is a 12-acre property located in Sayreville, New Jersey, near the Raritan River. The Horseshoe Road site contains three distinct areas. The first area is the Atlantic Development Corporation (ADC) Facility, which was used for chemical processing of coal tar, asbestos, sealants, epoxy resins, pesticides and solvents. The ADC facility contained three buildings that were owned or leased by many companies during the years of operation. The second area, the Horseshoe Road Drum Dump, was used for disposal from 1972 into the early 1980s. The last area, the Sayreville Pesticide Dump, was also used for disposal, from about 1957 into the early 1980s.

The neighboring Atlantic Resources site was a precious metals recovery operation. Both sites, Atlantic Resources and Horseshoe Road, were originally addressed together as the Horseshoe Road site. In response to concerns from a responsible party group, Atlantic Resources was listed as a separate Superfund site. However, the remedies for both sites have been addressed together due to their close proximity and intermixing contaminant plumes.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site first came to EPA’s attention in 1981, when a brush fire at the Horseshoe Road Drum Dump exposed about 70 partially filled drums containing acetonitrile, silver cyanide and ethyl acetate.

The site has been addressed in several stages: initial actions and long-term remedial phases.

Initial actions: EPA and NJDEP removed more than 3,000 drums (found buried and on the surface), emptied and disposed materials found in numerous tanks and vats throughout the site, and excavated and disposed contaminated soils and debris at an off-site disposal facility. Following initial actions to protect human health and the environment, EPA conducted site investigations and placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1995.

In April 2001, EPA completed the first or three long-term remedial actions for the Horseshoe Road site by removing the buildings and surface debris from the ADC facility.

In August 2010, EPA completed its second long-term remediation at the Atlantic Development and Sayreville Pesticide areas of the Horseshoe Road Site. That remediation effort removed approximately 190,000 tons of contaminated soil including deep soils that acted as a source of groundwater contamination. The contaminated soil was sent off site for disposal at an approved disposal facility.

The final long-term remediation of the site addressed contaminated river and marsh sediment. The remediaiton included hydraulic dredging of contaminated sediments in the Raritan River, capping of the dredged area, and mechanical dredging of a marsh area adjoining the river. The dredging project began in the summer of 2015 and the restoration of the marsh and river was completed in November 2017. Due to acid conditions in the upper marsh soil, restoration plantings in the upper marsh did not succeed and lime was applied to the acidic soils in January of 2020. The upper marsh was replanted in June 2020 and full vegetative restoration was completed by April 2021.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA continues to monitor the groundwater to ensure contaminant levels in groundwater do not increase.
