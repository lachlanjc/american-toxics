### Background

The 3.3-acre Highland Acid Pit site is located in Highlands in Harris County, Texas, on a peninsula in the San Jacinto River 10-year floodplain. Early in the 1950s, the area received an unknown quantity of industrial waste sludge, believed to be spent sulfuric acid, from oil and gas refining processes. The waste disposal activities contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

Remedy construction and operation have effectively reduced risk from 22,000 cubic yards (33,000 tons) of contaminated industrial sludge. The San Jacinto River has been protected from off-site migration of wastes, precluding fish kills similar to prior events.

EPA has conducted five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Long-term protectiveness requires semi-annual groundwater monitoring, evaluation whether additional action is necessary for chemical concentrations above cleanup levels, implementation of surface water and sediment monitoring, and upkeep of wells and other site maintenance.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy for source control, selected in 1984, included excavation of waste and contaminated soil with off-site disposal. The remedy also included backfilling the excavation, revegetation and installation of a fence. Cleanup removed 22,200 cubic yards of waste and soil from the site. Cleanup finished in December 1987. Institutional controls, including a deed notice, were implemented.

The long-term remedy for groundwater, selected in 1987, was “no action.” Despite its name, the "no action" remedy included installation of groundwater monitoring wells and a 30-year monitoring program for groundwater and surface water. Monitoring is ongoing.

EPA completed its FY 2018 Five Year Review (FYR) for the Site on May 24, 2018. The FYR is a document that determines if a Site is protective of both human and environmental health. This document is available on the Site webpage and at the local repository.

In December 2020 & June 2021 TCEQ performed monitoring events for groundwater, surfacewater, and sediment at the Site. They also conducted operations and maintenance activites at the Site. EPA has expected the results for these field activities in the Annual 2021 Groundwater Monitoring Report and have made the results avaialble on the Site webpage.

EPA uploaded a copy of the FY 2022 Highlands Acid Pits Superfund Site Superfund Site-Data Review Memorandum—November-December 2021 Groundwater, Surface Water, and Sediment Sampling Report. It was added to the Site webpage on Friday June 24, 2022.

EPA is currently in the process of performing a FY 2023 Five Year Review (FYR) for the Highlands Acid Pit Superfund Site. The FYR is a document that determines if a Site is protective of both human and environmental health. The completion of this document is projected for sometime during Summer 2023. Copies of the FY 2023 FYR will be availalbe on the Site webpage and at the local repository.

### Sampling and Monitoring

TCEQ performs semi-annual sampling events for groundwater, surface water, and sediment. They also conduct operations and maintenance activites at the Site.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Site cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In May 1984, EPA constructed a fence around the pit to prevent further illegal dumping and to protect monitoring wells from vandalism. In July and August 1985, EPA repaired the fence and posted warning signs.
