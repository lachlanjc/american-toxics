### Background

The 5-acre Silver Mountain Mine site is located in Horse Springs Coulee, six miles northwest of Tonasket, Washington. It includes the area where a mine operated sporadically from 1928 to the 1960s to extract silver, copper and gold from soil and ore. From 1980 to 1981, site owners constructed a cyanide heap leach pile to extract silver and gold from the previously mined tailings by applying a sodium cyanide solution to the top of the heap. The cyanide-laden solution was then collected in a leachate pond at the base of the heap. The heap leach operation was abandoned in 1981 without cleanup of cyanide-contaminated materials. Mining operations generated mine-tailing wastes that contaminated groundwater.

The site was added to the NPL in October 1984. A cleanup plan was developed by EPA in March 1990. The cleanup was completed in 1992. During the cleanup, the mine tailings and the heap leach pile were consolidated and covered to limit exposure to the wastes. The waste pile continues to be regularly inspected by the Washington Department of Ecology. EPA removed the site from the Superfund programâ€™s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1997.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Silver Mountain Mine occupies a five acre site located in Okanogan County, Washington, approximately six miles northwest of the town of Tonasket. Silver Mountain Mine was originally opened as the Silver Star in 1902 by the Silver Star Mining Corporation, Tonasket, Washington. Silver, gold, and copper were all extracted from the mine. The mine went through a number of changes in ownership between its opening and cessation of mining-related activities in 1981.

From 1980 to 1981, a cyanide leach heap of previously mined material was constructed and operated in an attempt to extract silver and gold - sodium cyanide was mixed with water and sprayed on the top of the heap. The cyanide-laden effluent was then collected in a leachate pond at the base of the heap. The leach heap operation was abandoned in late 1981 without cleanup of contaminated material.

In June 1981, the owner of the surface rights to the property informed Okanogan County Health Department officials of the heap leaching operation. The Health Department collected samples from the site, and the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) also investigated the site. In 1982, Ecology took an early action to treat the cyanide at the site by using sodium hypochlorite to partially neutralize the leachate pond and heap. EPA conducted a Preliminary Assessment and Site Inspection in 1984. In 1982, Ecology conducted a site stabilization effort which included removal of liquids from the leachate pond and installation of a plastic cover over the heap and pond to reduce infiltration. In 1985, empty cyanide drums were also removed from the site.

The site was listed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1986. The U.S. Bureau of Mines, under an Interagency Agreement with EPA, performed a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) at the site in 1988 and 1989. Special notice letters were issued to the identified Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs), but all of the recipients of the Special Notice letters declined to participate in the RI/FS. The Record of Decision (ROD) was issued in 1990 and an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) was issued in 1994. The ROD established that the following remedial actions would be taken to address site-related contamination:

- Consolidation of the arsenic and cyanide contaminated soil and mined rock.
- Leach heap, mine dump and soil cleanup standards were established for arsenic (200 mg/kg) and cyanide (95 mg/kg).
- Construction of a soil/clay cap over the consolidated soil and rock.
- Closure of the mine entrance to divert the flow of mine drainage away from the site and for safety reasons.
- Fence the site to protect the cap.
- Place deed restrictions on the property to prevent future disturbance and to make future owners aware of the site.

Construction of the remedy was deemed complete in November 1992. During implementation of the remedy, EPA was unsuccessful in finding water when they attempted to drill a new well to provide an alternate stock water supply. An Explanation of Significant Differences was completed in October 1994 to identify a small spring as an alternate source for stock water. The site was removed from the NPL on September 22, 1997. Measures implemented included:

- The heap leach pile and an on-site pond were treated to neutralize the cyanide;
- Mine tailings and heap leach piles were consolidated, covered, and seeded;
- Drums of hazardous materials were removed from the site;
- Mine entrance was blocked for safety and to divert runoff; and
- Site fenced for safety and to restrict access.

The site is currently used to graze cattle one or two months per year.

The Washington Department of Ecology periodically inspects the site and, every five years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency conducts a review to make sure that the cleanup measures continue to protect people and the environment. The reviews conducted to date, have indicated that the protective measures were in place and effective at preventing further exposures to people and the environment.

  
  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The remedy at the site was completed in 1994.

The site was removed from the NPL in 1997.

Washington Department of Ecology periodically inspects the site.

Every five years, EPA reviews the effectiveness of the cleanup.

**Cleanup Progress**

In 1982, Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) completed an early action to treat the cyanide at the site, using sodium hypochlorite to partially neutralize the leachate pond and heap. In addition, Ecology removed liquids from the leachate pond and installed a plastic cover over the heap and pond to reduce infiltration.

In 1985, Ecology removed empty cyanide drums from the site.

In 1990, EPA issued a long-term cleanup plan for the site. It included consolidating, grading and covering contaminated materials with a clay cap; fencing the site and sealing the entrance to the mine; disconnecting the mine drainage pipe from the existing stock tank and provide an alternate water supply for cattle; deed restrictions to protect the cap; EPA completed these actions in 1992.

In 1994, EPA issued an Explanation of Significant Differences to modify the source of the stock water supply from a new well to an on-site spring and reported the cleanup was complete.

In 1997, the site was removed from the NPL. Periodic inspections and Five-Year Reviews continue to be required.
