### Background

The 40-acre Westline site is located in Westline, Pennsylvania. A lumber processing plant operated at the site during the early 1900s. A chemical facility on site converted lumber into charcoal, methanol and acetic acid until 1952 when a fire caused the facility to close. Activities at the site contaminated soil and groundwater. The Westline Inn began operating on the site in 1975. EPA discovered toxic tar deposits from the former operations in soil and groundwater in the early 1980s. Following removal of exposed tar deposits, thesite was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1983. Following cleanup of several additional tar deposits and monitoring groundwater for contaminants, EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 1992.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1983, property owners placed a fence and warning signs around the property and EPA emergency workers capped the largest tar deposit. After cracks and leaching began to occur at the capped area, EPA began excavating and removing 2,000 tons of tar and contaminated soils from the site.

In 1990, EPA completed the removal of tar deposits and associated contaminated soils. The soil was replaced and all contaminated materials were transported off-site to an EPA facility. EPA has completed all planned cleanup activities. Groundwater and soil studies confirmed the area has been cleaned up to levels that do not pose a threat to public health or the environment.

EPA deleted the site from the Superfund programâ€™s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1992.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 2015, EPA identified another tar area in the creek and conducted a site evaluation. Based on the evaluation, it was determined additional excavations of wood tar seepage was necessary. A removal of approximately 250 tons of wood tar and wood tar contaminated soil and debris was transported and disposed of off-site in 2017. In accordance with recommendations from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, EPA implemented wetland restoration activities. Routine, periodic monitoring of site conditions was conducted by EPA through mid 2018 to ensure there was no change in site conditions. No new seep areas were identified.

In 2020, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation conducted a bridge replacement project in the area. EPA worked closely with the agency to address wood tar seeps. EPA continues to monitor the area for any additional wood tar.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions in 1983 placed a fence and warning signs around the property. Removal actions also included capping the largest tar deposit with clay, covering and grading the area, and putting down seed and mulch. When cracks appeared in the cap, additional actions excavated and removed 2,000 tons of tar and contaminated soil from the site. Removal of tar deposits finished in 1990. Additional wood tar excavations were conducted in 2017.
