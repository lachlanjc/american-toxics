Background
The Austin Avenue Radiation site is located in Lansdowne Borough, East Lansdowne Borough, Upper Darby Township, Aldan Borough, Yeadon Borough and Darby Borough in Pennsylvania. The site consists of 40 privately owned properties. W.L. Cummings Radium Processing Company conducted radium-refining operations at the site from 1915 to 1925. These operations generated radioactive wastes. Waste disposal practices contaminated residential properties with radium, thorium, radon, and asbestos. The Site was added to the National Priorities List on October 14, 1992. Following cleanup, EPA deleted the site from the National Priotrities List in 2002. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In June 1994, following a comprehensive site investigation, the EPA selected a remedy to clean up the Site. The remedy included the removal of materials contaminated with radioactive waste, the demolition of contaminated houses, the repairing of one contaminated house, the permanent relocation of residents of eight of the demolished houses, the rebuilding of ten of the houses, and the removal of contaminated soils on 21 different properties in five municipalities. Under an Interagency Agreement with the EPA, the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers cooperated on the design phase for the remedy selected in 1994. Site cleanup activities began in late 1995 and were completed in November 1997. All the permanent residential relocations have been completed. All radiologically contaminated structures have been dismantled, and the associated contaminated soils on the affected properties have been excavated and shipped off site for disposal. Excavation of the warehouse property, the most heavily contaminated property, began in April 1997 and was completed in November 1997. EPA and USACE transferred ownership of the warehouse property back to its owner. By February 1998, all 11 home rebuilds were completed, and the properties were returned to their respective owners. Some properties were not rebuilt, because the home owners chose to be permanently relocated. These properties have been transferred as vacant lots to the local municipalities in which they lie, as requested by the municipalities which agreed to assume ownership and to use the properties for the benefit of the communities. In September 1996, EPA issued a No Action Record of Decision (ROD) for groundwater at the Site. The total amount of radiologically contaminated materials disposed off site was 241 rail cars (approximately 20,000 tons). A Five-Year Review (PDF) was completed in 2000 and demonstrates that the cleanup has been effective. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
The EPA deleted the Austin Avenue site from the National Priorities List, a list of the nation's most hazardous waste sites, in 2002. The close-out report for the Site was finalized in August 2001, and the Site's Five-Year Review demonstrates that the cleanup remedies have been effective and continue to be protective of human health and the environment. No additional Five-Year Reviews or Institutional Controls will be needed at the Site, as all cleanup goals have been met. All the properties at the Austin Avenue Site have been returned to their original owners or transferred to the local municipalities in which they are located.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Institutional controls are in place. The Record Of Decision for operable unit 1 includes a provision for institutional controls for instances where soils could not be removed to a level where the property is available for unrestricted use and unlimited access. Additional information about the institutional controls is available in the 2000 Five-Year Review (PDF).
