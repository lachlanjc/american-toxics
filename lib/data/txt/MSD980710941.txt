### Background

The 225-acre Flowood [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in the wetlands and lowlands area of the Pearl River floodplain in an industrial area of Flowood, Rankin County, Mississippi. Industrial and commercial land uses border the site to the north and east. A forested area and a road border the site to the east. A forested area borders the site to the west. The nearest residences are located over a half-mile from the site. The Sonford Products Superfund site is located approximately one-mile north of the site.

The site includes an area where various manufacturing facilities have operated since the 1940s. The Continental Forest Company owned and operated at the site’s northern facility from 1956 to 1983. In 1983, Stone Container Corporation purchased the facility and continues to operate at the site. The Marmon Group owned and manufactured ceramic tiles at the site’s southern facility from the 1950s until the early 1970s, when Rival Manufacturing Company purchased the facility and manufactured stoneware cooking pots until 2003.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1983 because of contaminated sediment and soil resulting from facility operations. EPA, the [Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ)](https://www.mdeq.ms.gov/) and the site’s [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) United Gas Pipe Line Company, Continental Group, Rival Manufacturing and the Mormon Group, have investigated site conditions.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. By undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, MDEQ and the PRPs continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The PRP, including United Gas Pipe Line Company, Continental Group, Rival Manufacturing and the Mannon Group, led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.

**1983**  
EPA investigated the site and discovered five areas containing lead contamination.

**1984**  
Site PRPs placed 47,000 cubic yards of treated materials under a cap on site and completed cleanup actions in 1994.

**1988 - 1993**  
EPA issued the site’s cleanup plan and updated it in 1991 and 1993. The final plan included digging up, solidifying and stabilizing contaminated soil and placing it in a capped 2.2-acre landfill, and covering, regrading and reseeding dug-up areas. In addition, the plan included monitoring groundwater for a year after completion of cleanup activities and placing institutional controls on the site property.

**1996**  
EPA took the site off the Superfund National Priorities List in 1996.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11160250.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2021. The remedy at the Site is currently protective of human health and the environment.

Operation and maintenance activities as well as monitoring activities are ongoing.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Operation and maintenance activities as well as monitoring activities are ongoing.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site's Potentially Responsible Parties to investigate and clean up the site. The PRPs continue to fund monitoring and oversight activities.
