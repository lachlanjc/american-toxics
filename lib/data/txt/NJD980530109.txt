### Background

The Goose Farm site is located in Plumsted Township, New Jersey. A manufacturer of polysulfide rubber and solid rocket fuel propellant disposed of solid and liquid hazardous wastes at the 6.6-acre area from the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s. The majority of wastes were dumped into a pit dug through fine sand. Waste chemicals from laboratories, drums and bulk liquids were dumped into the pit, contaminating soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Soil cleanup has been completed. Long-term groundwater treatment is ongoing. Under current conditions at the site, potential or actual human exposures are under control.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Immediate Actions: In September 1980, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) installed and operated a groundwater recovery, treatment and spray irrigation system. This system operated for seven months, until March 1981, and treated about 7.8 million gallons of contaminated water. About 5,000 containers (drums, lab packs and pails) holding 9,000 gallons of bulked liquid waste were removed from the waste pit and disposed of at an approved off-site facility. In addition, cleanup activities included the removal of contaminated soil. About 3,500 tons of grossly contaminated soil and an additional 12 drums of PCB waste were disposed of off-site. The site was fenced to prevent access.

Long-term Cleanup: In 1985, EPA selected a remedy to clean up the site. It included recovery and treatment of contaminated groundwater and soil flushing with the treated effluent, in conjunction with evaluating the need to cap the site, and testing the soil for contamination. A slurry wall to contain the area of contaminated groundwater and a groundwater treatment system were put in place. System startup took place in June 1993. Its operation is ongoing.

EPA has conducted six five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in two stages: immediate actions and a long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.  

In 1985, the EPA selected a remedy to clean up the site that includes recovery and treatment of contaminated groundwater and flushing the soil with the treated effluent, in conjunction with evaluating the need to cap the site, and testing the soil for contamination. Start-up of the groundwater remediation system occurred in June 1993 and the operation of the system is ongoing.

Removing the liquid and solid hazardous wastes and installing the preliminary groundwater treatment system greatly reduced the potential for exposure to contaminants at the Goose Farm site, while long-term groundwater cleanup activities are taking place.

EPA continues the oversight of all cleanup activities. To date, the siteâ€™s groundwater treatment system has treated over 400 million gallons of contaminated water at the site. The system will operate until groundwater meets safe drinking water standards. Under current conditions at the site, potential or actual human exposures are under control.
