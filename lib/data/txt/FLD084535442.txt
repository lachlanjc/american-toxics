### Background

The 170-acre Munisport Landfill site is located in North Miami, Florida. It includes the area where a former municipal landfill operated from 1974 to 1981. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1989 because of contaminated groundwater resulting from the landfill. EPA, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and the City of North Miami, the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP), have investigated conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination.

Studies completed in the late 1980s found that while landfill contamination did not potentially threaten people living on or near the site, the area did pose a significant threat to aquatic organisms (e.g., plants and animals) in wetlands next to the site. Cleanup has addressed the threat to aquatic organisms. By addressing groundwater contamination and closing the landfill, EPA, FDEP and the site’s PRP continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is a 170-acre former municipal landfill located in the center of North Miami, a city situated between Miami and Fort Lauderdale in southeastern Florida. The landfill is part of a larger 291-acre parcel of land formerly planned to be part of a trade and cultural center and, later, a recreation center. The 291-acre parcel includes the 170-acre landfill, a 15-acre upland area, a 93-acre altered wetland and a 13-acre wetland next to Biscayne Bay. The 291-acre parcel borders a post office and retail businesses to the west, 151st Street to the north, and residential areas, including a mobile home park, to the south. Florida International University borders the site to the northeast. Biscayne Bay is located east of the site and includes a State of Florida mangrove preserve.

The City of North Miami owns the site. Part of the landfill is now Biscayne Landing, a mixed-used, master-planned residential and commercial development. Redevelopment also included the construction of a school on part of the site next to the landfill after the EPA completed site cleanup work. The site is the location of a former municipal landfill that operated from 1974 to 1981. The landfill filled in low-lying wetland areas with construction debris and solid waste in an effort to raise the area’s elevation for the construction of a trade and cultural center known as Interama. The landfill disposed of the solid waste without the use of a liner or leachate control mechanisms, which control water that collects contaminants as it passes through contaminated material. Rainfall moving slowly through the solid waste caused the release of contaminants into underlying ground water as well as nearby surface water. The EPA completed a remedial investigation in 1988 and a water quality and toxicity assessment in 1989 and found that while landfill contamination did not potentially threaten people living on or near the site, the site did pose a significant threat to aquatic organisms (e.g., plants and animals) in the wetlands next to the site. The EPA listed the site on the NPL in 1983.

The PRP, the City of North Miami, led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and FDEP.

EPA implemented the site cleanup plan in phases: tidal restoration of the wetland area; construction of access and service roads; installation of hydraulic barrier recovery wells; and development of the groundwater treatment and disposal system. EPA completed the tidal restoration of the wetland area, including the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve and the State of Florida mangrove preserve, in 1995. EPA completed construction of access roads and recovery wells for the hydraulic barrier in 1996. After extensive study of the changes in water quality and toxicity conditions in the mangrove preserve, EPA concluded that increased tidal circulation had eliminated the movement of contamination from the site into the preserve. As a result, EPA updated the cleanup plan in 1997, stating that no further action was necessary to address site groundwater. In 1999, EPA took the site off the NPL.

In 2004, Miami-Dade County provided funding to the City of North Miami to close the landfill and clean up underlying groundwater contamination. Miami-Dade County and the City of North Miami are overseeing the closure of the landfill and groundwater cleanup. Following the completion of cleanup activities under Superfund and the removal of the site from the NPL, EPA does not require Five-Year Reviews for the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1990, EPA issued the site’s long-term cleanup plan. It included a hydraulic barrier – a system of groundwater wells – to collect contaminated groundwater before it flowed from the landfill into the nearby mangrove preserve; treatment of contaminated groundwater using air stripping; and discharge of treated groundwater to the underlying aquifer. Associated activities included the tidal restoration of a State of Florida mangrove preserve and a hydraulically altered wetland area. In 1997, EPA revised the cleanup plan, indicating that no further action was necessary to address site groundwater.  

Miami-Dade County and the City of North Miami are overseeing the closure of the landfill and ground water cleanup. Following the completion of cleanup activities under Superfund and the deletion of the site from the NPL, the EPA does not require Five-Year Reviews for the site. The site’s status does not warrant further updates at this time.

### Enforcement Information

EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site PRP, the City of North Miami, to investigate and clean up the site. The PRP funded site cleanup activities and continues to fund monitoring and oversight activities.
