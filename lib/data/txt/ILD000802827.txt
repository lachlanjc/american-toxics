### Background

The Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC) site is located in the northern section of Waukegan Harbor in Waukegan, Illinois. The 100-acre area along the shore of Lake Michigan is the former location of an outboard-boat-motor manufacturing plant and a former railroad tie, coal gasification and coke plant facility. Contaminants of concern include [polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)](https://www.epa.gov/pcbs), which OMC used in hydraulic fluids at its boat motor manufacturing plant, and [trichloroethene (TCE)](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/trichloroethylene.pdf), a chlorinated solvent that OMC used to degrease newly made parts. Following immediate and long-term actions to protect human health and the environment, the site's few remaining cleanup steps are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA divided the site into [four areas for cleanup, referred to as operable units (OUs) (pdf)](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/955683) (2.69MB) ( [About pdf](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ).

[Many site cleanup milestones have already been achieved](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.schedule&id=0510399). The cleanup of each area is discussed below.

**Operable Unit 1 (OU1)** – Waukegan Harbor: OMC, under EPA oversight, first cleaned up Waukegan Harbor in 1992 by dredging PCB-contaminated [sediment](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-contaminated-sediments). To fully clean up the harbor, from 2012-2013 EPA hydraulically dredged harbor sediment with residual PCB contamination and placed it in a consolidation facility on site between the East and West Containment cells. During 2014, the dredging-related equipment was removed, and the consolidation facility with the dredged PCB-contaminated sediment was capped. The State of Illinois Department of Natural Resources will continue to monitor PCB levels in harbor fish annually.

**Operable Unit 2 (OU2)** – Former Waukegan Manufactured Gas and Coke Plant (WCP): Soil cleanup began in November 2004 and finished in November 2005. Thousands of tons of contaminated soil were dug up and removed. Once cleanup levels were met, excavated areas were backfilled with clean material, and a clean topsoil layer placed over the site for commercial / industrial reuse. The City of Waukegan owns and maintains the property. [Groundwater](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-groundwater-introduction) cleanup consists of two phases, one active and one passive. The active phase began in the fall of 2008 with construction of a groundwater treatment plant. Treatment took place in innovative aerobic (oxygen-loving) bacterial reactors in which the organic chemical contaminants served as food for the bacteria. “Digested” water was then filtered and pumped back into the ground. Active groundwater cleanup finished in September 2011. All machinery has since been dismantled. The passive phase began in early 2012.North Shore Gas and EPA monitor remaining groundwater contamination beneath the property, now owned by the city, until cleanup goals are met, which is expected to take nearly 90 years. Institutional controls have already been recorded on the city’s property, and EPA is working with Illinois EPA and Larsen Marine Service to record proper institutional controls for portions of the site that Larsen obtained from the city. In 2015, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers placed clean sediment dredged from the outer section of Waukegan Harbor onto the Waukegan Coke Plant site under an agreement between EPA, Illinois EPA, and the City of Waukegan. The sediment will be part of a city-planned 3-foot-thick clean soil barrier to permit residential development of the property.

**Operable Unit 3 (OU3) – PCB-Containment Cells:** Three PCB containment cells were constructed and filled in 1992. These are known as the East and West Containment Cells and the former Slip 3. The City of Waukegan, under EPA oversight, is in charge of the operation and maintenance of the Slip 3 and East containment cells. Since 2005, the city has maintained surface covers on the containment cells, conducted routine inspections, and operated groundwater pumps to remove and treat water from inside the cells. To date, monitoring shows that the cells are robust, and no leaks have occurred. In 2014-15, two new containment cells – the consolidation facility and the Old Die Cast cell – were completed to encapsulate very contaminated soil discovered in the southwestern portion of the site and sediment from the Harbor dredging activity of 2012-2013. Illinois EPA is in charge of the operation and maintenance of the West Containment Cell, the consolidation facility and the Old Die Cast cell.

**Operable Unit 4 (OU 4)** – OMC Plant 2: EPA received funding under the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to begin cleanup on the PCB-contaminated Plant 2 building. Demolition work on the 600,000-square-foot building began in January 2010 and finished in July 2010. About 5,000 tons of steel were recovered, most of which was recycled locally. In 2010, EPA also began digging up and removing contaminated soil and sediment for off-site disposal. Excavation and off-site disposal of over 350,000 cubic yards of soil and sediment was substantially completed in 2015. A groundwater plume highly contaminated with site-related solvents (referred to as [dense non-aqueous phase liquids, or DNAPLs](https://www.epa.gov/remedytech/dense-nonaqueous-phase-liquids) ) was treated in 2011 with bentonite clay and zero-valent iron to break down the contaminants. Other lower concentration contaminated groundwater plumes were treated in 2014 by injecting the groundwater with an oxidizer (sodium permanganate) to break down the solvents.

To address groundwater contamination near the property’s south boundary, an air sparging system was installed in September 2011. In 2020 U.S. EPA transfered operation and maintenance of this Water Treatment System to Illinois EPA as the lead agency. Also in 2020, EPA built an on-site wetland in the northwest corner of the site that serves as a infiltration treatment wetland to remove naturally occurring levels of ammonia from water being discharged from the water treatment system. The approximate size of the wetland is 1.6 acres. The location of the wetland allows Waukegan to expand it to manage additional stormwater associated with any future city needs. EPA will continue to perform operation and maintenance (O&M) activities related to the wetland until early 2022 when it plans to transfer those activities to Illinois EPA as the lead agency. EPA will monitor residual groundwater contamination until mid-2025, when EPA plans to hand that task over to Illinois EPA.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is developing [Institutional controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls) that will need to be placed on the property to protect the integrity of the implemented remedies. They will include the concrete mattresses installed over the sediment along the harbor walls that were part of the final dredging remedy.

Additional actions to be taken as a result of the 2022 five-year review of the site include:

- Maintain a fish-consumption advisory for the harbor until fish concentrations reach safe levels
- Develop and implement an operation and maintenance plan for capped sediment areas

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

### Enforcement Information

In 1988 U.S. EPA, Illinois EPA, and Outboard Marine Corp. (OMC) signed an agreement that required OMC to clean up PCB-contamination from the Waukegan Harbor and the OMC property. In 2005 a supplemental consent decree was issued that listed [operation and maintenance (O&M) obligations](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-operation-and-maintenance-and-long-term-response-actions) for U.S. EPA, Illinois EPA, and the City of Waukegan. O&M is an important component of a Superfund response, ensuring that the remedy continues to perform as intended and remains protective of human health and the environment.
