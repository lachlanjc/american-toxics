### Background

The 2.7-acre Mowbray Engineering Co. [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in Greenville, Alabama.

It includes an area where Mowbray Engineering Company discharged used transformer oil from its facility, which repaired and reconditioned electrical transformers.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1983 because of contaminated soil resulting from waste handling practices.

EPA, the [Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM)](http://www.adem.state.al.us/default.cnt) and Alabama Power Company, the site’s [primary potentially responsible party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), have investigated conditions. By conducting operation and maintenance activities, placing institutional controls on the site property and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, ADEM and the site’s primary PRP continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

Contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA led the site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with ADEM. Alabama Power Company, the site’s primary PRP, leads site operation and maintenance activities, with oversight provided by EPA and ADEM.
