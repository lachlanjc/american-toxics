### Background

The 213-acre Nineteenth Avenue Landfill is located in Phoenix, Arizona. The landfill contains about nine million cubic yards of waste. Landfill activities and improper waste management practices at the site contaminated groundwater and soil with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides. EPA deleted the site from the Superfund National Priorities List in 2006.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal, state and local actions. The City of Phoenix implemented a long-term remedy including containment of landfill wastes on site with a cap and collection and flaring of landfill-generated gases to make sure off-site migration of landfill gas is prevented. Levees were constructed at the Salt River to prevent future flooding and waste wash-out. Construction of the remedy finished in 1996. The landfill methane gas collection and flaring system has been operating since 1997. The landfill has not impacted off-site groundwater quality and continues to be monitored.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The City of Phoenix provides on-going maintenance of the landfill cap and methane gas collection and flaring system, and continues groundwater monitoring.

EPA took the site off the NPL in 2006.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the siteâ€™s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. EPA completed the Fifth Five Year Review in September 2020. This most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Short-term cleanup actions included covering the site with sand, gravel and stones, and constructing earthen berms and a fence on the site to limit access. In 1981, the city installed a system to collect methane gas and monitoring wells to sample groundwater.
