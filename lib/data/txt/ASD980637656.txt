The site consists of a warehouse and trailer where the Government of American Samoa stored outdated agricultural chemicals and pesticides. Improper storage practices contaminated the floors of the warehouse and trailer. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund programâ€™s national Priorities List (NPL) in 1986.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Removal actions, or short-term cleanups, included sealing the warehouse opening to restrict site access; repacking, shipping and disposing of pesticides; sweeping, vacuuming and washing exposed surfaces; painting; concrete pouring; and access controls.

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1986.
