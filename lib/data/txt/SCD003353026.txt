### Background

The 145-acre Koppers Co., Inc. (Florence Plant) Superfund site is located 1.5 miles east of Florence. Site surroundings include residential areas, hospitals, schools and a day care center. Agricultural lands, an airport, commercial businesses and light industrial operations are also located nearby. The site is the location of an active wood treating and preserving plant.

The site includes the area where a wood-treating and preserving plant has operated for several decades. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1984 because of contaminated groundwater, sediment and soil resulting from facility operations.

EPA, the State of South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC), and Koppers Co., Inc., the site’s [potentially responsible party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site.

In 1991-1992, EPA’s Superfund program deferred the site to EPA’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Corrective Action program. In 1996, EPA’s RCRA program deferred the site to the State of South Carolina’s RCRA program. Because of the deferral process, the state is directing site investigations and cleanup. EPA deleted the site from the NPL under its policy for deferred RCRA-lead sites. Cleanup activities under the RCRA program will continue. By monitoring the facility, treating groundwater, and cleaning up contaminated soil and sediment, EPA, SCDHEC and the site's PRP continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The plant uses three preservatives in its operations: creosote, pentachlorophenol (PCP) and chromated copper arsenate.

**1971 - 1983**  
State and federal permits for wastewater discharges required the plant to upgrade operating practices, starting in 1971. SCDHEC required plant operators to spray the plant's liquid wastes over a field and allow the liquid to evaporate. Plant operators also pumped penta-oil wastes into four unlined lagoons, where they released the oil through evaporation and seepage.

In 1974, the plant violated the limits of its federal discharge permit, and the EPA ordered the company to study and control runoff. In addition to numerous difficulties with contaminated runoff, the EPA and the state later identified additional problems at the site.

**1984**  
EPA listed the site on the NPL.

**1991 - 1996**  
In 1991-1992, EPA’s Superfund program deferred the site to EPA’s RCRA program.

In 1996, the EPA’s RCRA program has formally deferred all activities to SCDHEC. It is because of the deferral process, the SCDHEC’s RCRA program is directing site investigations and cleanup activities. The site’s PRP is undertaking a number of corrective actions at the site under the State of South Carolina’s RCRA program.

**2013** EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 2013 under its policy for deferred RCRA-lead sites. Cleanup activities under the RCRA program will continue. No further updates from the Superfund Program are expected.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 2013 under its policy for deferred RCRA-lead sites. It is because of the deferral process, the SCDHEC’s RCRA program is directing site investigations and cleanup activities. The site’s PRP is undertaking a number of corrective actions at the site under the state of South Carolina’s RCRA program.
