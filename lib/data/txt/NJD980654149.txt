### Background

The Asbestos Dump site consists of an 11-acre property in Millington, New Jersey, and three separate satellite sites: 1) the 12-acre White Bridge Road site, 2) the 30-acre New Vernon Road site, and 3) the 7-acre Dietzman Tract site in the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge (GSNWR). An asbestos products manufacturing facility operated at the Millington site; asbestos wastes were disposed of at the satellite sites. Long-term operation and maintenance of the remedy at the Millington property is ongoing. Cleanup of the satellite sites has been completed. EPA took the site off the Superfund programâ€™s National Priorities List in July 2010.

The Millington site lies in a residential and commercial area. Beginning in 1927, a succession of owners operated an asbestos products manufacturing plant at the Millington site. Asbestos was disposed of at the Millington site, comprising a large mound approximately 1.5 acres in size. Prior to remediation, erosion and weathering of the mound exposed areas of asbestos along the Passaic River bank. The Dietzman Tract site (Operable Unit 3), is approximately 7 acres and is loctaed within the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge (GSNWR), 2 miles southeast of New Vernon Road. This site was used as a refuse and asbestos disposal area for approximately 40 years and is bordered by Great Brook and a woodland habitat. The New Vernon Road and White Bridge Road satellite sites are residential properties. The New Vernon Road site occupies approximately 30 acres. Broken asbestos tiles and siding, as well as loose asbestos fibers, were landfilled on this former corn and dairy farm during the late 1960's. The White Bridge Road site, covering 12 acres, is bounded by the GSNWR and private residences. This property was a farm until 1969, when the current owner started landfilling asbestos waste from the Millington facility. The wastes were present on the site as subsurface fill or as part of an asbestos waste mound. Disposal continued until 1975. Site Responsibility: This site is being addressed through Federal actions.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Construction activities have been completed on all three operable units comprising the Site. Operation and Maintenance activities are ongoing. The White Bridge Road portion of the site was deleted from the NPL on February 8, 2002. A close-out inspection of all operable units was conducted by EPA on September 8, 2008 as part of the Superfund Site Deletion Process. The site deletion for the remaining portions of the site, including OU1, OU2-New Vernon Road, and OU3, became effective on July 12, 2010.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents.  
The reviews concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The next five year review for OU3 is scheduled to be completed by September 2025.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Cleanup at the four subsites included erecting signs and fences, capping, installing a soil cover over areas of exposed asbestos, stabilizing slopes along asbestos mounds, removing asbestos-containing materials on the ground surface, and in-place solidifying and stabilizing of asbestos-containing materials. Workers excavated asbestos materials from the Dietzman Tract site and either disposed of the material off site or consolidated the material on site in a landfill. Workers also excavated, consolidated, solidified/stabilized and then capped on-site asbestos-containing material from about 5 acres of the New Vernon Road site and the White Bridge Road site. A 25-acre part of the New Vernon Road site was transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2002 and is now part of the GSNWR. A residential property and horse farm are now located on the White Bridge Road site.

EPA removed the White Bridge Road site from the National Priorities List in 2002. EPA removed the other satellite sites from the National Priorities List in 2010. Operation and maintenance activities for the remedy at the Millington site and the OU3 Dietzman Tract site are ongoing.
