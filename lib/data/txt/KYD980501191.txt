### Background

The Howe Valley Landfill site is located in Howe Valley, Kentucky. It includes an area used as an industrial waste landfill from 1967 to 1976. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1987 because of contaminated soil resulting from disposal operations. EPA, the Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection (KDEP) and Dow Corning, the site’s lead potentially responsible party (PRP), investigated site conditions and took steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from m contamination. In 1994, the PRP removed all site-related contamination. In 1996, EPA took the site off the NPL. No additional Superfund actions at the site are required.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site includes 11 acres of rolling terrain in Howe Valley, Hardin County, Kentucky. The site is a mile south of Highway 86 (Hardinsburg Road) and a mile east of Highway 920 (Salt River Road). The site sits in a remote area surrounded by forested and agricultural land. A few rural homes are located north of the site. Elizabethtown, the largest nearby city, is about 10 miles east of the site.

From 1967 to 1976, Kentucky Industrial Services, Inc. operated an industrial waste landfill on 2.5 acres of the site. Operators disposed of drums of sludge and bulk wastes associated with various manufacturing and insulation operations on site. Operations ceased in 1976 after the state landfill permit expired. The Kentucky Division of Water Quality (KDWQ) visited the site in 1979 and found waste material and drums exposed on the surface of the landfill. Groundwater samples collected by KDWQ indicated that the site might have been contaminating local groundwater. In 1987, EPA listed the site on the NPL.  
The site’s lead PRP conducted site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and KDEP.

In 1988, two site PRPs agreed to conduct the site’s remedial investigation/feasibility study, as well as to dig up and properly dispose of buried wastes on the site property. The PRPs completed cleanup activities in 1994. Although not required to do so, lead PRP Dow Corning removed all contamination from the site so that no contaminants remain on site above levels that will restrict use of the site or threaten people.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1990, EPA issued the site’s cleanup plan. It included digging up and disposing of 100 cubic yards of outlying soils containing high levels of inorganic contaminants; replacing removed soils with clean dirt; digging up and treating 7,400 cubic yards of central area soils using on-site aeration; conducting a study to make sure the aeration process would effectively lower contaminant levels; and monitoring air on site to protect workers and nearby residents. It also included installing water diversion ditches; restoring the site to its natural conditions; monitoring Boutwell Spring and additional springs on a quarterly basis for five years; and placing restrictions on the site property deed to limit uses of the property and associated groundwater.  

EPA took the site off the NPL in 1996. Five-Year Reviews are not required for the site. No further updates are warranted at this time.
