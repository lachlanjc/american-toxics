### Background

The Whitewood Creek site covers an 18-mile stretch of Whitewood Creek in Lawrence, Meade and Butte counties in South Dakota. Since the 1870s, gold mining operations in the area included the discharge of millions of tons of mine tailings into the creek. These mine tailings settled along the Whitewood Creek floodplain, contaminating soil, groundwater and surface water with heavy metals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1996.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires revegetation of the disposal area and remediation of properties with geofabric breaches.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The long-term remedy included excavation of 4,500 cubic yards of contaminated soil from 16 residential yards, disposal of the contaminated soil in an on-site landfill, institutional controls and surface water monitoring. Remedy construction took place between 1991 and 1993. Butte, Meade and Lawrence counties adopted ordinances in late 1993 and early 1994 that prohibited construction of new residential or commercial structures on the tailings deposits, restricted future development in tailings-impacted areas of the site, and prohibited removal and use of tailings outside the tailings areas. Surface water monitoring is ongoing.
