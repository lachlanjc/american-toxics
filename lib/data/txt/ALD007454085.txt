### Background

The 16.4-acre T.H. Agriculture & Nutrition Co. (Montgomery Plant) [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) Site is located on the west side of Montgomery, Alabama, approximately two-miles south of the Alabama River and just west of Maxwell Air Force Base. There are two adjacent parcels of land – the T.H. Agriculture property and the former Pennwalt property (now owned by Elf Atochem) included within the Site's footprint. Commercial and industrial land uses border the Site to the north, east and south. An undeveloped residential area borders the Site to the west. A mobile home park is located northwest of the Site.

It includes the area where operations formulated, packaged and distributed pesticides, herbicides and other industrial and water treatment chemicals.

The EPA placed the Site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1990 because of contaminated groundwater, sediment, and soil resulting from operations at the Site.

The EPA, the [Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM)](http://www.adem.state.al.us/default.cnt) and the Site’s [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) have investigated site conditions. By monitoring groundwater, placing institutional controls on the site property and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, the EPA, ADEM and the site’s PRPs continue to protect people and the environment.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the Site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Elf Atochem North America Inc. (Elf Atochem) and THAN, the Site’s Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs), led Site investigation and cleanup activities during the OU-1 activities, while Elf Atochem has implemented the design and cleanup phase of the final OU-2 cleanup. The EPA and ADEM have provided oversight of all Site activities.

The EPA has divided the work at this Site into two parts, or [Operable Units (OUs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#o):

- OU-1 was an interim action addressing groundwater only
- OU-2 was a final action addressing groundwater, soil, and sediment at the Site

**1997 - 2002**  
The OU-1 remedy was put in place in 1997 and consisted of a groundwater extraction system that pumped contaminated groundwater to the city of Montgomery's local water treatment facility. The groundwater extraction system operated from 1997 to 2002.

**2002 - 2004**  
The OU-2 remedy was constructed. Approximately 2,850 cubic yards of contaminated soils and sediment were excavated from five areas at the Site and consolidated for treatment using biological soil additives. These biological additives used living organisms to break down Site contaminants until soil cleanup standards were met. Excavated areas were backfilled. Both the excavated areas and the treated soils were re-vegetated. Treatment of the soils/sediment was completed in 2004.

**2010**  
Elf Atochem completed demolition of all on-site buildings:

- The OU-2 remedy also called for the groundwater to be monitored until groundwater cleanup standards were met
- The OU-2 remedy called for institutional controls to restrict groundwater use until cleanup goals were met, while also restricting land use to commercial use only. These institutional controls were put in place in 2014

**2012 – 2017**  
Since the 2012 FYR, groundwater wells, at the site, were monitored in 2012, 2013, 2016, and 2017. In 2017, several groundwater wells that were no longer being used were plugged with bentonite and abandoned.

**2017-2024**  
Since the 2017 FYR, groundwater wells, at the site, were monitored annually from 2017 to present. The [fifth Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11173695.pdf) was completed in 2022. Groundwater monitoring will continue until Site cleanup goals are met.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11173695.pdf) was published in 2022. The final soil and groundwater remedies at the T.H. Agriculture and Nutrition Site are expected to be protective of human health and the environment, and in the interim, exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks are being controlled.

Currently, the Site is vacant. There are no plans to redevelop the Site. Groundwater monitoring will continue, while the sixth Five-Year Review will be conducted in 2027.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Fencing has been installed, and ICs have been put in place to control future land use.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Groundwater monitoring will continue. The sixth Five-Year Review will be conducted in 2027. The report will be posted here when complete.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, the EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the Site’s PRP to investigate and clean up the Site. Elf Atochem continues to fund Site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
