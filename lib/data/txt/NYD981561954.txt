### Background

The C&J Disposal site is located in the Town of Eaton, Madison County, New York, near the intersection of Routes 12B and 46. The site originally included a rectangular disposal trench that measured approximately 140 feet by 40 feet. The disposal trench was situated between a former railroad bed and an active agricultural field and was on property immediately adjacent to residential property owned by C&J Leasing of Paterson, New Jersey. Approximately 100 feet south of where the trench was located is a small pond and adjacent wetlands which drain to Woodman Pond, a back-up water supply for the Village of Hamilton. There are twelve residences in the vicinity and downgradient of the site that use private wells as their source of drinking water.

In March 1976, C&J Leasing personnel were observed dumping what appeared to be paint sludges and other liquid industrial waste materials in a trench on its property. Inspections were subsequently conducted by the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), and Village of Hamilton Engineer. Approximately 100 drums were observed lying in a stagnant pool of liquid wastes in the previously-described trench. The trench was subsequently covered with fill, reportedly by C&J Leasing, apparently burying the drums. Sampling was conducted at the site by NYSDEC in 1985 and EPA in 1986. Surficial soil samples obtained from the site revealed the presence of phenolic compounds, phthalates, various volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and lead. Bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate was detected in the sediments of the adjacent pond. EPA sampled two private wells downgradient of the site during its 1986 sampling effort, but did not detect any contaminants. Additional sampling by NYSDOH in 1988 of four private wells downgradient from the site did not reveal any contamination.

The site was placed on the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) in March 1989.

In April 1989, prior to the start of an EPA remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine the nature and extent of the contamination and to identify and evaluate remedial alternatives, the site was subject to an unauthorized excavation by the principals of C&J Leasing, leaving two large holes and three stockpiles of contaminated soil and waste material. The drums that were believed to have been previously buried may have been removed at this time, or earlier, and taken off-site. An extensive follow-up investigation failed to determine where the drums may have been taken.

The site was cleaned up in 1993 and removed from the NPL in 1994.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed in two stages: immediate actions and a single long-term remedial phase focused on the cleanup of the entire site.

Immediate Actions: EPA stabilized several stockpiles of soil and waste material. Fences and gates were installed to upgrade site security measures. Sampling of the site was performed for waste disposal classification.

Long-term Cleanup: Based upon the results of an RI/FS performed from 1989-1991, EPA selected a remedy in the siteâ€™s 1991 Record of Decision, or ROD. It included digging up and removing contaminated soil and debris and disposing of it at an EPA-approved disposal facility. The remedy also included quarterly monitoring of both on-site and off-site wells for one year. Remediation of the adjacent pond was not required.

The excavation and removal of contaminated 2,400 cubic feet of soil and debris was completed in 1993. The waste material was taken to a permitted off-site disposal facility and the trench was backfilled and revegetated. Quarterly testing of on-site groundwater monitoring wells and local residential wells took place for one year following the completion of on-site remedial activities; no contaminant migration was found.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Following completion of cleanup activities, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1994.
