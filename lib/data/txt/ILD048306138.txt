### Background

The 66-acre Tri-County/Elgin Landfills Site is located in Kane County, Illinois. The landfill operated between 1968 and 1976. Municipal, commercial, and industrial wastes were disposed of during those years, some of which were disposed of improperly. Investigation at the Site from 1988 to 1992 identified contamination in soil, sediment, and groundwater, and contaminants could migrate off-Site through rain and snowmelt infiltrating through waste fill materials, leaching contaminants from those materials, and transporting them to groundwater and surface water by surface and subsurface flow. The landfill was closed under court order in 1981.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The cleanup which occurred from 1999 to 2001 included excavation and capping of contaminated soil, construction of a landfill cover to prevent infiltration, collection and treatment of landfill gas, monitoring of groundwater, and restrictions on land and groundwater use. Very low levels of inorganic contaminants, including aluminum, manganese, iron, and lead still exist in soil and groundwater on the site. There is no contamination at locations away from the site.

Long-term protectiveness requires compliance with land-use restrictions that prohibit interference with the cap; restrict any land use that would allow the continued presence of human exposure; and limit groundwater use. Compliance with state-required institutional controls known as “continuing obligations” will be accomplished by monitoring and enforcing them. Site cleanup components will also be maintained. This has been in place since 2013.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA completed a five-year review of the Tri-County/Elgin Landfills Superfund site in July 2019. The site is located at 7N 500 Illinois Route 25, Elgin, Illinois. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This was the fourth review of the site.

This review included an evaluation of background information, cleanup requirements, effectiveness of the cleanup, and maintenance and monitoring efforts. It also looked at ways to operate more efficiently. The review concluded the cleanup is protecting people and the environment. The next review is scheduled for 2024.

The five-year review report and other site-related information are available at the Gail Borden Library, Gail Borden Public Library, 270 N. Grove Avenue, and under Reports and Documents on this web page.
