### Background

The 30.5-acre Clinch River Corporation [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) Site is located in Harriman, Tennessee. It includes the area where a paper and pulp mill operated from 1929 to 2002. The Site is located in the 100-year floodplain on the Emory River.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 2012 because of plant operations, that resulted in contaminated debris, soil, sediment and groundwater.

EPA and [Tennessee Department of Environment & Conservation (TDEC)](https://www.tn.gov/environment/about‐tdec‐home.html) oversee data collection and remedial action activities by WestRock and another local individual.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**2012**  
In early 2012, EPA conducted a removal action of drums and former process fluids from the Site because it is located in the 100-year floodplain on the Emory River.

The EPA lead removal action addressed asbestos from former turbine house in time-critical removal July 2012.

The Site was listed to NPL in September 2012.

Mead-Westvaco, now known as West Rock, conducted a full EE/CA for the process area to collect data for all media along with including demolition and remaining debris.

**2018**  
On March 5th 2018, the EPA and West Rock entered into an agreement to conduct a non-time critical removal action (NTCRA) and remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) which were completed simultaneously.

The NTCRA l removed previous operations buildings, create a stormwater management system, and repair a breached flood wall.

The remedial investigation began in 2018 and will include groundwater and soil sampling. This work is expected to be complete in 2026 at which time a Record of Decision will be completed at the Site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

After the non-time crticial removal action is conducted and data collection efforts confirm next steps, WestRock will compile the data in a remedial investigation and present a feasibility study for any potential remediation that may be needed. The City of Harriman is currently utilizing portions of the Site as riverfront park, complete with boat slips and walking trails.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The Site is fenced off with a lock.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA and WestRock entered into an administrative order on consent for the non-time critical removal action and a consent decree on the remedial investigation/feasibility study on March 5, 2018 and the RI/FS is ongoing
