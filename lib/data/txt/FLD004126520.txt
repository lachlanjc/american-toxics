### Background

The7-acre Standard Auto Bumper Corporation [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located in Hialeah, Florida. The site is located in a commercial and industrial area of Hialeah, Dade County, Florida. The area surrounding the site includes industrial properties and businesses. A railroad borders the site to the west; to the north, a furniture company, which the site boundary now includes; to the east, an automobile storage area; and to the south, a tile company.

Standard Auto Bumper Corporation operated a small electroplating facility from 1959 to 1993. Operators initially discharged wastewater into a ditch behind the facility, then treated wastewater and discharged it to a percolation pit on site. From 1959 until 1972, Standard Auto Bumper Corporation discharged wastewater into a ditch behind its facility. Between 1972 and 1979, the company treated the wastewater and discharged it into a percolation pit. Miami-Dade County found contamination at the site in 1977.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) of contaminated sites in 1989, because of contaminated soil and groundwater resulting from facility operations. The site now also includes two properties next to the original site boundary.

EPA, the [Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP)](https://floridadep.gov/) and Miami-Dade County have investigated site conditions. By monitoring institutional controls and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA and FDEP continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

In 2007, EPA deleted the site from the NPL and restricted land use to clarify future site use potential. Today, three businesses operate on site. Services include truck parking, concrete fencing and roofing. A bakery and a furniture company are located on an area that became part of the site after EPA expanded the original site boundary.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. Both residents and businesses use the public water system for drinking water. Groundwater currently meets federal and state drinking water standards and groundwater monitoring no longer occurs.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Standard Auto Bumper Corporation, the site’s [potentially responsible party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), initially led site investigation and cleanup activities and abandoned the site property in December 1992. Since 1993, EPA has led site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with FDEP.

Site investigations and cleanup activities have focused on two areas, which the EPA refers to as operable units, or OUs. These areas include

- OU-1: source control of the contaminated materials associated with the facility
- OU-2: groundwater contamination associated with wastewater disposal practices at the facility.

**1992 – 1994**  
To address immediate concerns, the PRP removed and disposed of contaminated soil at solid waste landfill and hazardous waste disposal facilities.

Prior to starting the cleanup of OU-1, the PRP abandoned the site in December 1992. EPA took the lead on the site’s cleanup, removing all hazardous material from the site, including low-pH metal plating solutions, plating waste sludge, contaminated soil and chemical containers. In 1994, following completion of the cleanup, EPA demolished and removed all buildings and other on-site structures.

The site’s long-term remedy for OU-1, selected in 1992, included

- digging up contaminated soil above the water table
- disposing of excavated soil at a Florida Class I landfill
- monitoring groundwater for five years.
- The site’s long-term remedy for OU-2 included
- using monitored natural attenuation for groundwater contamination
- implementing groundwater use controls
- monitoring groundwater quality.

**2001**  
FDEP conducted five years of operation and maintenance activities that included groundwater monitoring and sampling. FDEP completed groundwater monitoring in 2001 when site groundwater met cleanup standards for industrial land uses.

**2005**  
A roofing company purchased the parcel as a storage area for vehicles and supplies. A bakery and a furniture company are located on the 5-acre and 1-acre properties, respectively, that became part of the site after EPA expanded the original site boundary.

**2007 – 2011**  
In 2007, EPA added a restrictive covenant to the main facility property deed limiting future operations to industrial land uses.

In 2011, EPA updated the remedy to require institutional controls.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [fifth Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11150455) was published by EPA HQs in 2020. The Sitewide Protectiveness Status is protective of human heaith and the environment in the short term..

Institutional controls will remain in place at the site.

Monitoring of the two properties outside the original site boundary will continue due to potential soil contamination underneath building foundations.

The EPA plans to complete the next Five-Year Review in 2020.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site PRP to investigate and clean up the site. In 1991, Standard Auto Bumper Corporation abandoned the site property. The EPA assumed responsibility for the cleanup in cooperation with FDEP. In 2004, the City of Hialeah and Miami-Dade County assumed ownership of the portion of the site previously used for electroplating operations due to unpaid property taxes.
