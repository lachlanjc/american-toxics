### Background

The Croydon TCE Site is located in a 3.5 square mile area within the southernmost portion of Bristol Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The area includes residential, commercial, and industrial properties. EPA identified the Croydon TCE site in 1985 after an investigation at a neighboring Rohm & Haas industrial plant revealed a plume of groundwater contamination that did not appear to be associated with that plant. Elevated levels of volatile organic contaminants (VOCs), primarily trichloroethene (TCE), have been detected in the groundwater and in surface water. However, to date, no source has been identified. This site was proposed to the National Priorities List on September 18, 1985 and was formally added to the list on June 10, 1986.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**Operable Unit 1 (OU1)**  
  
EPA began construction of the OU1 water line in November 1989. EPA installed water mains on portions of Bellevue Avenue and Bristol Pike and connected 10 residences and 1 commercial business to the new water mains. EPA transferred control of the water lines to the Borough of Bristol Water and Sewage Department in June 1990. Groundwater monitoring required by the OU1 ROD has been conducted as part of OU2 activities.  
  
**Operable Unit 2 (OU2)**  
  
EPA constructed the groundwater extraction and treatment system between June 1994 and March 1995. The groundwater system included extraction and observation wells, an air stripper tower, a flow equalization tank, granular activated carbon as a polishing step for treated water and for off-gas treatment, and a building to house all equipment. The extraction wells were designed to reach the deeper parts of the unconsolidated aquifer, about 55 feet below ground surface, where the highest levels of TCE were detected. The discharge point of the treated water was the West Branch of Hog Run Creek. The Site achieved construction completion status when EPA issued the Site’s Preliminary Close-Out Report in March 1997. From March 1995 through January 2006, EPA and its contractors conducted operation and maintenance (O&M) activities during the long-term response action (LTRA) for the groundwater extraction and treatment system. In January 2006, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) assumed responsibility for all future O&M activities associated with the system, in accordance with the Superfund State Contract (SSC).

Between March 2007 and September 2009, all wells on site were sampled for the contaminant, 1,4-dioxane. The analytical method used during the September 2009 sampling event achieved a detection limit of 0.5 μg/L. All samples came backnon-detect, except for observation well OW-9, which showed 1,4-dioxane at an estimated concentration of 0.5 μg/L. EPA and PADEP determined that sampling for 1,4-dioxane in groundwater was no longer necessary at the Site. In May 2008, EPA’s contractor conducted a direct push groundwater sampling event in residential area of the Site to address data gaps remaining from previous investigations, including the potential for vapor intrusion. TCE was detected in 6 of the 13 groundwater samples at concentrations below the MCL. Based on the low detection of VOCs in the 2008 groundwater samples, and the relatively low levels of VOCs in sitewide groundwater, EPA determined that vapor intrusion was not a concern at that time. Question B of the Five Year Review Report re-evaluates the potential for vapor intrusion to indoor air using the most recent groundwater data and updated screening criteria. Due to low contaminant concentrations remaining in groundwater and low contaminant concentrations in the treatment system influent, PADEP and EPA shut down the groundwater extraction and treatment system in March 2009 to conduct a contaminant rebound evaluation. Subsequent sampling rounds did not show any contaminant rebound.

The [2015 OU2 ESD (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/03/2217903.pdf) officially discontinued extraction and treatment of groundwater and allowed for the dismantling of the system (expected to occur in 2022). The treatment system building, and components currently remain on site. TCE concentrations in groundwater have generally remained below 15 µg/L in all site wells with no change in the plume extent since system shutdown.

EPA and PADEP have been exploring alternative groundwater remedies to address remaining contamination. In 2014, PADEP initiated an enhanced monitored natural attenuation (MNA) evaluation. Between December 2017 and February 2018, PADEP’s contractor conducted a pilot test to evaluate injections of bio-stimulants (nutrients, sodium bicarbonate and dissolved methane) in certain areas where TCE levels were still above the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL), primarily near the treatment building on the Heritage Conservancy parcel. The in-situ bioremediation (ISB) injections were conducted to enhance the natural degradation of TCE. Thestudy found that increased methane concentrations in groundwater resulted in significant increases in methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) (methanotrophs) and soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO). The increased MOB and sMMO concentrations accelerate the natural TCE degradation rate by oxidizing the chlorinated solvents. PADEP’s contractor submitted an Enhanced Natural Attenuation Injection Activities and Data Evaluation Memorandum to PADEP in 2018, summarizing the activities and results. The 2018 ISB pilot study showed an immediate reduction of nearly 50% in TCE concentration but, subsequent sampling events demonstrated a rebound in concentrations close to the pre-pilot study concentrations.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent, [2021 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/03/2321358.pdf), concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short-term. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2026.
