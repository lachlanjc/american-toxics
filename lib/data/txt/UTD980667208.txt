Background
The Monticello Radioactively Contaminated Properties site consists of 424 private and commercial properties in and around the city of Monticello, Utah, covering approximately four square miles. Tailings were removed from the nearby Monticello Mill Tailings site, which is also on the Superfund National Priorities List. These tailings were used by various parties as fill for open lands; backfill around water, sewer, and electrical utilities; sub-base for driveways, sidewalks, and concrete slabs; backfill against basement foundations; and as sand mix in concrete, plaster and mortar.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) led cleanup activities under a Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) with EPA and the state. The long-term remedy included excavation and removal of contaminated tailings, soil and construction materials from properties surrounding the site. Contaminated materials were later disposed of at a repository about one mile south of the former mill. Remedy construction took place between 1984 and 2000.
