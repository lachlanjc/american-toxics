### Background

**Current Status**

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) are working with the Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) to address or continue the recommendations listed in the Five Year Review (FYR). EPA is in the process of starting the next Five Year Review which is due January 14, 2021. Thesecond FYR report was signed on January 14, 2016.,. Based on the information available during the first FYR, the selected remedy for the Combustion Inc. site is currently performing as intended. The remedy is considered protective because ICs are in place; therefore, there are no current or potential exposures. The recommendations and follow-up actions identified in this FYR process should be addressed or continued for long-term remedy protectiveness of human health and the environment until remedial action objectives are met.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  
  
EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires implementation of recommendations and follow-up actions.
