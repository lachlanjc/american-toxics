### Background

The 8-acre Folkertsma Refuse site is located in Walker, Michigan. Prior to 1969, a licensed yet improperly zoned landfill operated on site. From 1969 to 1972, an industrial disposal facility operated on site. Today, a pallet manufacturing business continues to operate on part of the site. The site includes 57,000 cubic yards of landfilled waste consisting of foundry sand, chemical products, construction debris and other industrial wastes from heavy manufacturing operations. Waste disposal operations resulted in contaminated groundwater, sediments and landfilled materials. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1996. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included excavating contaminated sediments and placing these sediments in the landfill, landfill capping, improved drains and installation of gas vents. Additionally, the pallet manufacturing company relocated to an area north of the landfill limits. Fencing and deed restrictions control access and use of the site, and groundwater and drainage water monitoring ensure the effectiveness of the cleanup. Construction of the remedy finished in 1994. EPA took the site off the NPL in 1996. Operations and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Groundwater beneath the landfill was contaminated with arsenic. Sediments from two drainage ditches on the property and landfilled materials contained polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and metals, including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, nickel, and lead. Possible health threats could have occurred from direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated groundwater, sediments, or landfilled materials as well as from inhaling contaminated dusts. Contaminated sediments posed an environmental risk because of the possibility that the chemicals could bioaccumulate.
