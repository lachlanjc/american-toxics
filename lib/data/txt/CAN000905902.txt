### Background

The Southern Avenue Industrial Area (SAIA) is located in South Gate, California. The site is currently vacant and occasionally used for truck parking. From 1972 to 2012 the site was occupied by a facility that manufactured hot-melt adhesive tape for laying carpets. Prior to 1972, Pacific Screw Products Corporation manufactured screw products at the property. These operations may have contaminated soil and groundwater with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Remedial investigation activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA completed characterization of environmental media for the site in several efforts from 2012 to 2017 with the collection of soil, soil gas, groundwater, and air samples. The Remedial Investigation (RI) report describing this work will be completed in summer, 2019.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA listed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2012. Adding the site to the NPL enables EPA to study site conditions further, identify possible sources of contamination and develop a comprehensive strategy to address all locations and sources of VOC contamination.

The site’s remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) are ongoing. The remedial investigation looks at the nature and extent of contamination. The feasibility study looks at how cleanup can be conducted safely, effectively and in compliance with state and federal laws. EPA will use results from the RI/FS to develop a long-term cleanup plan.

The preferred remedy and remedial action objectives will be described in a Proposed Plan, which will be published in a fact sheet and distributed to the community. The Proposed Plan provides for a public comment period and community meeting. The selected remedy is then documented in a Record of Decision, which is implemented in the remedial design and remedial action at the site.
