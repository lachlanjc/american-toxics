### Background

The 115-acre Jacks Creek/Sitkin Smelting & Refining, Inc. Site is located in a rural agricultural area of Mifflin County, Pennsylvania. From 1958 to 1977, Sitkin Smelting Company operated a smelting and precious metals reclamation facility on Site. These activities contaminated soil, sediments in Jacks Creek and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. The Site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) on October 4, 1989. Following the cleanup, operations and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party actions.

The Site’s long-term remedy included excavation and off-site treatment of highly-contaminated soil; consolidation and capping of waste piles and remaining contaminated soil; dredging and consolidation of contaminated creek sediment; fish consumption advisories; wetlands replacement; monitoring of groundwater, surface water, and the health of the fish and benthic organisms in Jacks Creek; demolition of on-site buildings; removal of underground storage tanks, ash material, transformers and drums; and construction of a multi-layer cap.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The PRP Group conducts long-term maintenance activities at the Site. These activities include quarterly inspections of the site’s security fencing and gates, erosion controls, multi-layer cap integrity, stormwater management system, groundwater monitoring wells, wetlands and building areas. The PRP Group also conducts groundwater and sediment monitoring at the site and fish and biota sampling every five years.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the Site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by Site decision documents. The most recent [2021 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2314117), concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2026.

A fish consumption fish advisory is in place for bluegill, rock bass and fallfish from the portion of Jacks Creek adjacent to the Site. Consumption advisories for brown trout and white sucker have been lifted as of December 2009.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls are in place to restrict groundwater use, soil restrictions and to protect the remedy. Additional information about the institutional controls is available in the [2021 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2314117) (pages 11-15).

### Sampling and Monitoring

EPA continues to monitor sampling results to ensure the remedy remains protective in the long term. Long-term protectiveness of the remedial action will be verified by continued monitoring of the multi-layer-cap, surface water, sediment, groundwater and fish and biota.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions between 1990 and 1992 included the construction of berms to control the erosion of on-site soils and waste piles into Jacks Creek; placement of a plastic cover over a large pile of waste; removal of low-level radioactive switches from the Site; and removal of hazardous chemicals from an on-site building.
