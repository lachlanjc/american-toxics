### Background

Micro Storage/Intel Magnetics is a three-acre groundwater site located in a light industrial park in Santa Clara, California. The site is one of several South Bay Superfund sites impacted by pollution from the early electronics industry. Intel Magnetics (IM) produced and tested magnetic products on-site. Adjacent to IM, International Diagnostic Technology (IDT) tested electro-optical instruments, and Micro Storage Corporation (MSC) later researched and pilot-developed microcomputer disk drives. Past activities are believed to have resulted in contamination of soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals.

In the mid-1980s, federal and state agencies and potentially responsible parties (PRP) began actions to protect human health and the environment from potential effects of the contamination. Site investigations and cleanup work have been conducted, and monitoring is ongoing. The State of California transferred lead agency oversight to EPA in 2006.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Cleanup actions included:

- removal of an underground storage tank;
- excavation of contaminated soil;
- operation of a groundwater treatment system
Due to a significant decline in the contaminant removal rate, the state approved shutting down the groundwater extraction and treatment system. It also gave interim approval for a monitored natural attenuation trial to begin. These actions have resulted in reduced contamination and potential exposure risks.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Groundwater monitoring continues and contaminant concentrations have declined or remain stable. Elevated tetrachloroethylene (TCE) concentrations in groundwater have been observed upgradient of known sources. Even so, TCE concentrations appear to be decreasing.

Evaluations have indicated that natural attenuation is likely occurring. EPA is evaluating next steps.
