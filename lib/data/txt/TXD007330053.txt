### Background

The 12-acre Site is an abandoned creosote wood-treating facility in Longview, Texas (Figure 1). Garland Creosoting Company (GCC) operated a wood-treating facility at the Site from 1960 to 1997. Wood-treating operations included the disposal of recycled wood-treating wastes from tanks into unlined on-site surface impoundments. Site activities and waste disposal practices contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater with hazardous chemicals.

The Site includes a 2-acre Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C containment cell (Containment Cell), a groundwater treatment plant (GWTP), gravel access roads and two abandoned buildings. A chain-link fence topped with barbed wire surrounds the Site. Locked gates and warning signs control access to the Site. Garland Road and the Texas Eastman Company’s wildlife refuge border the Site to the east, State Highway 149 borders it to the west, light industry is north of the Site, and industrial facilities, wooded land and homes are south of the Site. The nearest residences are about a mile south of the Site, across the unnamed tributary, which is intermittent and runs east to west through the southern part of the Site. There are two drainage ditches on-site that feed stormwater runoff to the unnamed tributary. About 1,800 feet south of the Site, the unnamed tributary connects with Iron Bridge Creek, which eventually flows to the Sabine River.

Groundwater occurs in two hydrogeologic units: the SWBZ and the deep water-bearing zone (DWBZ); contamination is limited to the SWBZ. The depth to groundwater in the SWBZ ranges from about 7 feet below ground surface (bgs) near the intermittent unnamed tributary to about 12 feet bgs in the northern part of the Site. Groundwater flow in the SWBZ is to the south-southwest. The DWBZ has a depth of about 52 feet to 75 feet bgs and is separated from the SWBZ by a confining green clay. Groundwater flow in the DWBZ is to the south. The groundwater at the Site is not used as a drinking water source. Based on criteria established by the state of Texas, the groundwater beneath the Site is considered a potential water supply. However, the high iron content and low pH of most of this water render it unusable unless treated. There are no private or public drinking water wells located within 1 mile of the Site. The city of Longview derives 88 percent of its drinking water from surface water sources.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In September 2006, EPA signed the Site’s Record of Decision (ROD) to address the creosote/DNAPL-contaminated soil and groundwater impacted by volatile organic compounds (VOCs). EPA selected a remedy to address the following remedial action objectives (RAOs) for the Site:

Prevent or reduce the potential for exposure of the future outdoor worker to contaminated soil (0 to 2 feet bgs) in the pressure treating building and tank area.

Remove DNAPL and DNAPL-laden soils from the former impoundments that pose an unacceptable risk to the future outdoor worker in the event that soil in the impoundments is brought to the surface. In addition, this RAO would entail removing elevated concentrations of contaminants at the hot spots near soil samples K17, K19, JS30, D8 and F8 (Figure D-1) to the maximum extent practicable.

Prevent or reduce the potential for exposure of ecological receptors to on-site contaminated soil by removing stockpiled soil at JS02 and JS16.

Prevent or mitigate the potential for exposure of the future outdoor worker to groundwater contamination in the SWBZ.

Implement or continue the operation of engineering controls to prevent off-site migration of contaminated groundwater (naphthalene) and DNAPL to the intermittent unnamed tributary.

EPA completed the remedial action between August 2008 and August 2011.

The remedial actions included:

Excavation of DNAPL-laden soil and consolidating into a lined 2-acre RCRA Subtitle C Containment Cell constructed over the former impoundment areas (impoundments 1 through 4)\[1\] on-site.

Installation of 11 groundwater RWs connected to the existing GWTP, which was installed in 2003.

On-site groundwater treatment in the existing GWTP that receives groundwater from the RWs and two groundwater ICTs (ICT-3 and ICT-2). The GWTP also periodically receives groundwater from a third ICT-1 (a French drain) and leachate liquid from the Containment Cell’s leachate collection sump. ICT -1 is no longer sending groundwater to the GWTP.

Discharging of treated extracted groundwater and leachate liquid to the unnamed tributary located south of the Site.

Separation of DNAPL from groundwater and sending it off-site to an incineration facility as a hazardous waste.

Monitoring for CVOCs, semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and groundwater quality parameters associated with natural attenuation.

In 2016, EPA completed an Optimization Review Report that included suggested remedy improvements. The improvements included modifications to the GWTP, installation of new monitoring wells on-site and off-site, and the plugging and abandonment of existing monitoring wells. In March 2019, EPA contractors completed an Optimization Implementation Report that summarized implemented actions to address the review report’s findings

In 2022 The TCEQ assumed responsibility for the Operation and Maintence Activiites at the Site.

Maintenance duties are currently being performed by TCEQ’s contractorin accordance with the Site’s 2021 O&M Plan. TCEQ has been responsible for Site landscaping and Containment Cell O&M activities since August 2013. In May 2022, EPA transitioned responsibility for the following O&M activities to TCEQ: the groundwater treatment system, effluent sampling and groundwater monitoring.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The Garland Creosoting Superfund is currently in the Operation and Maintenance phase of the Superfund Program. The TCEQ is responsiable for O&M activities at the Site. EPA maintains oversight of O&M activities.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The 2006 ROD required implementation of Institutional Controls to restrict the future use of the Site to commercial and industrial land uses and to restrict future use of groundwater from the SWBZ. TCEQ implemented ICs to restrict the future use of the Site to commercial and industrial land uses. TCEQ also implemented ICs for three of the five parcels in the TI zone to restrict future exposures to subsurface soil and groundwater use (Table 4, Figure 3). EPA is reviewing whether ICs are needed for the remaining two parcels because the dissolved PAH plume, as represented by Figure 3 is interpreted to potentially appear located outside the TI zone to the west and northwest Site boundary. EPA and the state are recommending further delineation is warranted to determine if further ICs prohibiting the use of groundwater in the SWBZ is warranted.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Currently TCEQ monitors effluent from the groundwater treament plant on a monthly basis and collects groundwater samples on annual basis. The results are documented in the Annual O&M Report for the Site. The groundwater and groundwater treatment plant effluent is analyzed for Volatile Organic Compounds and Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds.

### Emergency Response and Removal

In May 1997, the TNRCC began an emergency response action in response to a dark, oily discharge observed emanating from the sump of the ICT. During TNRCC’s pumping of the recovered groundwater from the ICT into tanks, several previously unidentified areas of creosote-saturated soil and storage vessels were discovered.

In October 1999, EPA initiated a time-critical removal action that included disposal of above-ground storage tank contents; demolition and disposal of buildings, vessels and piping; and excavation and disposal of creosote-contaminated soil and sludge from the on-site waste pond, the impoundments and the creosoting process area. Contaminated soils were excavated near the process area structures and in impoundments 1, 2 and 3. Excavation continued until either 1 foot of clean soil was excavated or groundwater was encountered. Contaminated soils were staged pending further action. In February 2000, EPA completed the removal action. These activities consisted of off-site disposal of a portion of the stockpiled soils, with some of the stockpiled soils returned to the excavated area of impoundment 3 after its lining with polyethylene sheeting. Polyethylene sheeting was spread over the waste, which was then recapped with 1 to 2 feet of clean soil from the Site and brought back to grade. Similar action was taken on excavated and staged soil in the former pressure treating building and tank area. Soil was removed from the pressure-treating building and related process operations area. Impoundments 4, 5 and 6 were not addressed during the removal action because of funding limitations.

Between October 2000 and May 2003, EPA and its contractors completed a non-time-critical removal action. It included the construction of ICTs along the southern border of the Site property north of the unnamed tributary to prevent migration of creosote from the Site and to capture on-site contaminated groundwater and DNAPL. EPA’s contractors also constructed a new GWTP to treat groundwater from the ICTs and discharge it to the unnamed tributary. The recovered DNAPL was sent to an off-site hazardous waste disposal facility.
