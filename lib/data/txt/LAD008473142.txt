### Background

**Current Status**

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) have been evaluating implementing a new cleanup strategy at the Marion Pressure Treating Company. Superfund site (MPTC Site) located in Marion, Louisiana (see Figure 1). On September 30, 2016, EPA signed the Record of Decision (ROD) Amendment for the site. The ROD Amendment identifies the revised remedy selected to address the source contaminants which consist of creosote. Creosote is comprised of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL). The revised remedy was chosen in accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq, and, to the extent practicable, the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), 40 CFR Part 300.

The ROD Amendment was developed after careful consideration of all public comments on the final Proposed Plan that was issued on June 30, 2016, and the ontents of the Administrative Record file for the site. The EPA coordinated with LDEQ throughout the revised remedy evaluation process and LDEQ concurred on the selected remedy. Details of the Selected Alternative Remedy The revised remedy for the MPTC Site consists of the following elements:

- Cap Improvement of the Residual DNAPL area
- Deep soil mixing with solidification/stabilization in the Free-Phase DNAPL area
- Consolidation and capping in the Big Creek Exposure area
- Limited action with longterm monitoring for the Shallow Ground Water area

**Site Background and History**

The MPTC Site covers approximately 22 acres in a rural area northwest of Marion, Louisiana. The site is located about 14 miles northeast of Farmerville and 35 miles north-northwest of Monroe, Louisiana. The site is on the east side of State Highway 551 about 0.5 miles north of the intersection of State Highway 551 and State Highway 33. An abandoned building, tanker trailer, and publicly owned treatment works sump are past woodtreating operations. During an EPA removal action in 1996, creosote contaminated soil was consolidated in an on-site area (Consolidation Area) and capped. The consolidation Area measures about 280 feet by 210 feet and is surrounded by a fence. Additionally, two small creosote contaminated spoil piles are located 500 to 600 feet south of the Consolidation Area. These features, in addition to a shed located near the spoil piles which presents the current site layout. During the 2000 Remedial Investigation, a fence was constructed around the perimeter of the Site to restrict access. Big Creek is an intermittent stream located to the east of the property, and an unnamed tributary to Big Creek is located west of the property. The former woodtreating operational area drains: (1) to the east towards Big Creek through drainage gullies collectively called the East Drainage Ditch, and (2) to the west towards the gullies collectively called the West Drainage Ditch.

MPTC began operations on November 1, 1964. MPTC produced pressure-treated wood products including poles, bridge pilings, fence posts, and other lumber. Creosote was reported to be the only wood preservative used during the wood treatment process. Between September 1996 and March 1997, EPA performed a removal action at the MPTC Site. Activities included the off-site disposal of fluids and sludge stored in the tanks, decontamination, dismantling, off-site disposal of the tanks and retort vessels (used for the distillation of the creosote), excavation of contaminated soil, and placement of the contaminated soil in a capped Consolidation Area. Approximately 10,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil were excavated and placed into the Consolidation Area. The contaminated soil was capped with a 2-foot-thick clay cover and an 18-inch-thick topsoil layer during this removal action.

**Public Comments on the Selected Remedy**

As part of EPA’s community relations efforts, public notices announcing the public comment period and opportunity for a public meeting were printed in the Bernice Banner. The Proposed Plan Fact Sheet was distributed to those on the site mailing list on July 6, 2016. The Final Proposed Plan was made available at the Marion City Hall, the LDEQ offices in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and the EPA offices in Dallas, Texas. A public meeting was held on July 20, 2016, to inform the public about the Revised Feasibility Study and the Proposed Plan. The comment period began on July 11, 2016, and ended on August 9, 2016, which provided the public 30 days to comment on alternatives to remediate the site. At the July 20, 2016, public meeting, EPA discussed the hazardous substance contamination problems at the site, presented the various remedial alternative that were considered, and presented the preferred alternative for remediation of the MPTC site. Twelve people attended the July 20, 2016, public meeting including representatives of the City of Marion and a representative for a local Congressman. The public was given the opportunity to make comments or ask questions. A full account of the public meeting can be found in the public meeting transcript that has been placed in the MPTC Administrative Record file. Questions from the City or Parish and the Congressional representative were received during the public meeting. No other questions or comments were received from the public during the public comment period. The Administrative Record file is available for public review at the information repositories listed in the next section of this fact sheet.

**National Priorities Listing (NPL) History**  
Proposal Date: 10/22/1999  
Final Date: 2/4/2000

**Location:** The former facility is situated on a 10-acre tract of land along State Highway 551, approximately 0.5 miles north of the junction of State Highways 551 and 33 in the town of Marion, Union Parish, Louisiana. Facility operations extended beyond the 10-acres and current areas of concern cover over 22-acres.

**Population:** Marion, one of the oldest towns in Union Parish, was settled by pioneers from Alabama, who named it after their old home county in that state. It was first incorporated on January 13, 1909. There is currently a reported population of 775. A population of approximately 1038 people is reported within a two mile radius.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included excavation, treatment, stabilization and disposal of residual wastes. The remedy also required backfilling and revegetation of excavated areas. Difficulties with a cleanup technology delayed implementation of the remedy. EPA and its contractor studied other options to replace the technology. More soil investigations and sampling began in 2013 and are ongoing.

The area is the former location of a wood-treating facility that used creosote in its treatment process. Operations started in 1964 and stopped in 1989 due to bankruptcy. Wood-preserving operations used creosote exclusively. The company disposed of creosote-contaminated process wastewater in an on-site, unlined surface impoundment from 1964 to 1985. MPTC began closure in 1985, but resulted in several unresolved Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) enforcement actions for lack of post-closure plans, ground water sampling plans, and invalid certification of clean closure.

In June 1989, LDEQ found the facility abandoned with no signs of recent activity and referred the site to the Inactive and Abandoned Sites Division. MPTC filed for bankruptcy in October 1989. The Inactive and Abandoned Sites Division requested a removal action by the EPA Response and Prevention Branch.

Between September 1996 and March 1997, EPA performed a removal action at the MPTC site. These activities included the offsite disposal of fluids and sludge stored in the tanks, decomtamination, dismantling and offsite disposal of the tanks and retort vessels at the site, excavation of contaminated soil, and placement of approximately 10,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil into a capped Consolidation Area. The contaminated soil was capped with 2-foot thick clay cover and an 18-inch thick topsoil layer.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Since the original Remedial Investigation Feasibility Study in 2001, there have been sampling or monitoring events conducted in December 2010, March 2011, March 2013, November 2014, and January 2015. Results of these additional sampling and monitoring events are included in the February 15, 2015, *Supplemental Field Investigation Report".*

Additoinal sampling and monitoring were completed as part of the Remedial Design and the results are included in the May 2021 *Final Remedial Design*.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. A removal action in 1997 removed several site structures and tank contents and consolidated sections of surface soil contaminated with creosote. EPA also installed a fence around the site to restrict access to suspected areas of contamination.
