Background
The 62-acre Koppers Co., Inc. (Texarkana Plant) site is located in Texarkana, Texas. A wood treatment facility operated on site from 1903 to 1961. Wood processing operations contaminated the site with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), creosote, pentachlorophenol (PCP) and zinc. Carver Terrace, Inc. acquired the northern 34 acres and built a subdivision of 79 homes in 1964. Bruce Kennedy purchased the remaining southern 28 acres and mined it for sand and gravel until the Texas Department of Water Resources (TDWR) ordered the company to cease operations in 1984. Following construction of the site’s remedy, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring ongoing

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires repairing fencing and removing vegetation from the fence line, deed restrictions to limit future excavation and drilling activities at the site, evaluation of the DNAPL removal system, assessment of sediment contamination, investigation of oily sheens and the development of a natural attenuation program. The area was the location of a 62-acre wood treatment facility that started operating in 1903. Koppers Co., Inc. purchased the site in 1933 and operated the facility until 1961, when the plant closed, the land was sold and, in 1962, the facilities were demolished. Carver Terrace, Inc. acquired the northern 34 acres and built a subdivision of 79 homes in 1964. Bruce Kennedy purchased the remaining 28 acres and mined it for sand and gravel until the Texas Department of Water Resources (TDWR) ordered the company to cease operations in the fall of 1984.The area was the location of a 62-acre wood treatment facility that started operating in 1903.

What Is the Current Site Status?
Remedy SelectedThe site’s long-term remedy included treatment or off-site disposal of contaminated soils, oil-water separation, and either carbon adsorption or fluidized carbon bed treatment of groundwater. EPA later updated the remedy to include the purchase of homes in an affected neighborhood, provision of relocation assistance funding to affected residents and reclassification of the future use of the property from residential to commercial. EPA later updated the remedy again to change the treatment approach for dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) to in-place treatment and natural attenuation.Cleanup ProgressThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed the buyout and relocation of affected residents in 1993. Soil removal and replacement activities removed about 3,000 tons of soils and materials from the site and finished in 1996. Construction of the DNAPL/groundwater remedy finished in 2002. The in-place treatment and natural attenuation remedies are ongoing.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.

Sampling and Monitoring
The TDWR and EPA sampled the Site in 1980 and 1981, respectively; onsite soil and ground water contaminated with PCP, arsenic, and creosote were identified.  Based on this information, TDWR referred the Site to EPA for inclusion on the National priorities List (NPL); the Site was listed on June 6, 1986.  Preliminary Site investigations began in October 1984 by collecting soil and surface/ground water samples.  Ground water samples were collected from several drinking water taps; no measurable levels of the constituents of interest were measured in the public water supply.  Based on Site soil sample results, EPA determined that portions of 24 lots in the Carver Terrace Subdivision needed a soil/sod protective low permeability barrier.  The RP implemented these actions in July 1985 while a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) was conducted.  Investigations of the subsurface soils and ground water defined subsurface areas of stable DNAPL (creosote) pools, which rest on low areas of the basal clay aquitard.

Emergency Response and Removal
From 1985 to 1986, the potentially responsible party (PRP) placed clean dirt and sod in the yards of 24 residences to prevent exposure to contaminated soils during site investigations.
