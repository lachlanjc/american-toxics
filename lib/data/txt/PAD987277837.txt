Background
 The Willow Grove site is located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The Navy portion of the site (NASJRB/WG), around 900 acres in size, was used for aircraft operations, maintenance, and personnel training.  This portion was closed under BRAC 2005 and ceased operations in 2011.  The Biddle ANGB side, around 200 acres in size, is still an active Air National Guard base. Past/present activity at the two adjacent facilities resulted in contamination that includes volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater, PFAS in soil, surface water, sediment and groundwater, and metals in soil. The Site was added to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in 1995.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
This site is being addressed through federal actions. A 2005 Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA), between the EPA, the  Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) and the Navy, identified areas for investigation and possible cleanup. The FFA provided the framework and a schedule to accomplish this work. Currently, there are 11 2 Navy operable units and two Air National Guard operable units being being addressed under the Superfund program.  The site team is currently working on an FFA amendment to add the Air National Guard as a party to the FFA with the Navy. EPA has signed Records of Decision (RODs) selecting remedies for eight operable units: Operable Units (OUs) 1 (Privet Road Soils, 2006), 5 (Antenna Field Landfill Soil, 2010), 7 (Antenna Field Landfill Groundwater, 2010), and 4 (Fire Training Area Soils, 2007) – No Action or No Further Action OU 3 (Privet Road Groundwater) – an interim remedy of institutional controls and groundwater monitoring – the Navy has transferred this property to the Air National Guard OU 6 and OU 10 (9th Street Landfill soil and groundwater) – Soil cover, hotspot excavation and disposal, land use controls, and monitoring OU 11 (South Landfill soil only) - Soil cover, hotspot excavation and disposal, land use controls, and monitoring
A full list of operable units can be viewed under the Operable Units section.

What Is the Current Site Status?
There are currently four Operable Units under investigation which may require a remedy at the site. This includes a polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) Operable Unit for both the NASJRB/WG and Biddle ANGB. The Navy has the lead role for cleaning up the NASJRB/WG portion of the site and the Air National Guard has the lead role for cleaning up the Biddle ANGB portion of the site. Per the Federal Facilities Agreement between EPA, the PADEP and the Navy, a Site Management Plan (SMP) is annually updated with activities at each operable unit and area of concern. For detailed information on the current cleanup status, see the Navy Administrative Record.
A full list of activities per each operable unit can be found under the Cleanup Progress section. 
Five Year Review The lead agency conducts five-year reviews for remedies when hazardous substances remain on site above levels that permit unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent Navy Five-Year Review can be found here, 2023 Five-Year Review (PDF)Exit. The most recent Air National Guard Five-Year Review can be found Exit The next five-year reviews are scheduled for 2028. Top of Page
Emergency Response and Removal
