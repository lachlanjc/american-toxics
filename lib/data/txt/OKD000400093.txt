### Background

The 160-acre Hardage/Criner site is located in Criner in McClain County, Oklahoma. Royal N. Hardage owned and operated an industrial hazardous waste land disposal facility at the site from 1972 to 1980. During its operation, the facility received about 21 million gallons of waste for storage or disposal. Wastes included acids, caustics, lead, cyanide, arsenic, aromatic solvents, chlorinated solvents, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), oil recycling waste and other hazardous substances. Poor waste management practices contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous substances. Wastes were capped in place and ground water cleanup activities have been ongoing since the 1990's.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

The initial actions taken by site PRPs to excavate or decontaminate soils and cap the source areas have reduced the potential exposure of nearby residents to site wastes. Additional protective activities include monitoring of attenuation in downgradient wells, tracking the volume of contaminants recovered and incinerated, and tracking the volume of water recovered from trench and water wells.

The EPA has conducted five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by the court and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is under the jurisdiction of the United States District Court of Western Oklahoma and operates under a 1990 court-ordered remedy and not under a traditional EPA Record of Decision (ROD). The court order specified remedial objectives for the site without specifying cleanup goals for individual media. The remedial objectives are to control the surface water pathway, preclude site access and direct contact with the waste, control air emissions from the source areas, and preclude the use of affected groundwater. The court orderâ€™s remedy components form the basis of a waste containment remedy that must be monitored in perpetuity.

The remedy included an interceptor trench and wells to collect and remove contaminated groundwater for treatment, a composite cap over source areas, vertical liquid recovery wells to remove pumpable liquids for off-site treatment by incineration and disposal, groundwater treatment, natural attenuation, institutional controls, and groundwater and surface water monitoring. Construction of the remedy began in November 1993 and finished in February 1995. EPA issued its Preliminary Close-Out Report for the remedy in September 1997. Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

The EPA completed the Fifth Five Year Review Report for the site on March 8, 2022, which concluded the remedy is protective of human health and the environment and the remedial objectives of the Court Order are being met.
