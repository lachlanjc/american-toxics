### Background

The 20-acre Lewisburg Dump [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) Site is located on a tract of farmland, one half-mile north of Lewisburg and 40 miles southeast of Nashville, Tennessee. The Site property includes a landfill and an abandoned limestone quarry, which is now a pond. Site surroundings are mostly farms and pastureland. A rock quarry processing plant is located just south of the Site. There are 10 homes and about 30 people residing within a half-mile radius of the Site.

The City of Lewisburg owned and operated the dump, using four acres in the western portion of the quarry as a landfill, between the late 1950s and 1979. The city allowed surrounding communities to use the landfill for both residential and industrial waste dumping. Industrial wastes reportedly placed in the dump included paint, paint strippers and solvents, industrial plastic waste, spent pickle liquor with residual metals, empty containers of adhesives, cements, lacquers and paints.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the Site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1983 because of contaminated groundwater and soil resulting from disposal operations. The EPA, the T [ennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC)](https://www.tn.gov/environment/about‐tdec‐home.html), and the City of Lewisburg, the Site’s lead [potentially responsible party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), have investigated Site conditions and taken steps to clean up the Site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The City of Lewisburg, the site PRP, leads site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by the EPA and TDEC.

| When | What |
| --- | --- |
| **1990** | The EPA issued the site’s long-term cleanup plan. It included:  - putting institutional controls in place, including a security fence and deed restrictions - removing all site surface debris and disposing of it in either one of the test pits on site or an approved sanitary or hazardous waste landfill - replacing plastic test-pit caps with landfill cap material - regrading the landfill cap to stabilize conditions - monitoring groundwater - reseeding and maintaining the landfill cap. |
| **1992 - 1993** | The site’s lead PRP began site cleanup activities in 1992 and completed them in September 1993. Cleanup included removing and disposing of exposed debris off site, reconstructing the existing landfill cover, and long-term monitoring. The PRP removed over  - 382 cubic yards of debris and soil, - 172 tires, - 50 empty drums and two drums of lead paint and sludge from the site, - and properly disposed of the material at approved facilities.  Monitoring of the landfill cap and groundwater is ongoing. |
| **2012** | The EPA sampled private drinking water wells in April for the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-VOCs and metals. Initial sampling results detected metals but did not detect VOCs or semi-VOCs. However, the levels of metals that were detected were below federal drinking water standards established under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. |

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA completed the site’s [sixth Five-Year Review in 2022](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11174380.pdf) and found that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires ongoing monitoring and five-year reviews.. EPA plans to complete another review in 2027.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The EPA put institutional controls in place, including a security fence and deed restrictions.
