### Background

The Vega Alta Public Supply Wells site is a public water supply well field in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico. The 50-acre area consists of six inactive and 15 active wells. The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) has been responsible for operating and maintaining the public water supply system. The U.S. Geological Survey sampled the wells and surrounding areas and found volatile organic compounds (VOCs), potentially harmful contaminants that can easily evaporate into the air, in the groundwater and soil. PRASA shut down contaminated wells. Affected residences were hooked up to a new distribution system. In 1984, groundwater treatment equipment was installed at one of the contaminated wells.  
The site’s long-term remedy is now in place. Groundwater treatment is ongoing. Under current conditions at the site, potential or actual human exposures are under control.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The community drinking water is provided by a public water supply that meets appropriate Federal and State drinking water standards and there is no exposure to contaminated drinking water emanating from this Site. The results of the fourth FYR issued in 2014 demonstrate that the immediate threats from the Site have been addressed, the remedies are protective of public health and the environment, and the groundwater cleanup goals are expected to be achieved through continued treatment of the contaminated groundwater.

In 1983, the U.S. Geological Survey sampled site wells and found VOCs in the Ponderosa well. This well and the GE 1 well were shut down due to the contamination. PRASA then installed the Bajura 3 well to eliminate the water supply shortage. In 1989, PRASA shut down the GE 2 and Bajura 3 wells because of non-compliance with drinking water standards. PRASA put in the Maguayo wells to compensate for the shortage.

After investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1984.

EPA selected two cleanup plans to address the site’s groundwater and soil contamination. In September 1997, EPA updated the remedy to address the remaining source of contamination to avoid further migration of contaminants to the groundwater. A soil vapor extraction (SVE) system, which acts as a vacuum to absorb vapors from the soil, was selected as the remedial alternative for cleanup of contaminated soil. Field activities for the installation of the groundwater treatment system started in April 2001 and finished in December 2001. The source area groundwater extraction and treatment system has been operating continuously since December 2002. About 20 million gallons of water are treated each month. Under current conditions at the site, potential or actual human exposures are under control.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site consists of two Operable Units (OUs). The first operable unit (OU-1) addresses the groundwater contamination at the Site. The second operable unit (OU-2) addresses the sources(s) of the contamination. The soil remedy has been completed and allows for use without restriction and it not discussed further in this FYR.

This site two long-term remedial phases focused don (1) cleanup of the entire site including soil and (2) groundwater cleanup. Under an Unilateral Administrative Order, the PRPs placed in operation a groundwater treatment system at the Ponderosa well in July 1994 with a treatment rate of 600 gallons/min. The OU-II ROD was signed in September 1997; it selected soil vapor extraction to address the soil contamination within the PRIDCO industrial park.

In 1987, EPA selected a remedy to clean up the groundwater by: (1) installing individual treatment systems for PRASA wells GE 1, GE 2, and Bajura 3 and discharging the treated effluent into the PRASA distribution system; (2) treating the Ponderosa well by air stripping and discharging the treated effluent into Honda Creek; (3) shutting down the Monterrey 2 and G & M private wells and hooking up the affected residents to the PRASA distribution system; and (4) conducting an investigation to fully assess and evaluate the source of the contamination. In 1989, EPA modified the 1987 remedy at the urging of the Environmental Quality Board to discharge the treated water from all the wells to Honda Creek. Some of the parties potentially responsible for the site contamination designed the technical specifications for the well treatment systems which was approved in March 1992. Construction of the treatment system at the Ponderosa Well was completed on December 22, 1993, and groundwater treatment commenced in July 1994. Connection of the G&M private user to the PRASA distribution system was completed on October 28, 1993. The Bajura 3, GE 1 and GE 2 PRASA wells are no longer in appropriate locations to capture the plume due to a change in the plume configuration resulting from a change in groundwater pumping conditions. On September 29, 1994 an Explanation of Significant Difference was issued by EPA that modified the selected remedy by requiring the installation of an extraction well in a new location, in substitution for Bajura 3, GE1 and GE2 known as Well A. New developments and information caused EPA to reconsider the idea of placing Well A at the leading downgradient edge of the plume of contamination. It was initially determined that a preferable location for this well would instead be near the center of the plume and as such this well was known as Centroid Well (CAW). On December 5, 1997 an Explanation of Significant Differences was issued by EPA that modified the selected remedy by requiring a well or a series of wells which will be known as the Source area Well(s). The SAW(s) will be located within close proximity to the source of contamination which has been determined to be within the PRIDCO Industrial Park. Final Remedial Design Work Plan submitted to EPA on November 25, 1998. Preliminary Remedial Design Report submitted to EPA on February 17, 1999. EPA’s approval of the Preliminary Remedial Design Report granted and a Final Remedial Design Report submitted to EPA on January 13, 2000. Five year Review Report signed on April 19, 1999. The Final Remedial Design Report was approved on June 19, 2000. The Remedial Action Work Plan was submitted to EPA on September 29, 2000 and approved on December 2000. Initiation of field activities for the installation of the groundwater treatment system was initiated in April 2001. Construction of the Source Area Wells (SAW) system was completed in December 2001. The Source Area groundwater extraction and treatment system has been operating continuously, with the exception of regional power outages or necessary system maintenance/repairs, since its startup in December 2002. Second Five Year Review Report signed on August 18, 2004 Third Five Year Review signed on August 2009. EPA has approved the permanent shutdown of the Ponderosa Treatment System. Soil: On September 30, 1997 a Record of Decision was signed to select a remedial alternative for the cleanup of the remaining source of contamination in order to avoid further migration of contaminants to the groundwater. A Soil Vapor Extraction System was selected as the remedial alternative for the cleanup of the contaminated soil. Unilateral Administrative Order issued on September 30, 1998. The Remedial Design Work Plan was submitted to EPA on December 18, 1998. EPAs comments provided to PRPs and a revised work plan received by EPA on September 15, 1999. EPA’s approval to proceed with the Preliminary Remedial Design report granted to GE on February 15, 2000. EPA’s approval of Preliminary Remedial Design Report (30%) granted on September 13, 2000. The Final Remedial Design Report (100 %) was submitted to EPA on September 29, 2000 and approved by on December 2000. Construction of the Soil Vapor Extraction System (SVE) was completed in December 2001.

The SVE System was brought on-line full time in December 2002 and is comprised of 10 nested wells in Area A and 6 nested wells in Area B/C. The wells are screened at various intervals (shallow clay, deep clay, weathered limestone), at lateral locations designated as Area A, B and C, depending upon the location of contamination. The SVE systems were operated from December 2002 until October 2008. Through October 2008, the SVE systems removed 2,750 pounds of VOCs. On September 25, 2008 EPA approved the Draft Revised Remedial Action Report and the recommendation to permanently shutdown the SVE. The SVE systems were shut down on October 1, 2008.

The West Company, and the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Corporation were issued a Unilateral Order by the EPA in 1989 to clean up groundwater contamination at the site. This Administrative Order was amended in December 5, 1997. A second Unilateral Administrative Order was issued by EPA in August 1990 to General Electric, Motorola, Harman Automotive, The West Company, and Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company to investigate the contamination source and groundwater plume that migrated from the treatment area. Another Unilateral Administrative Order was issued on September 30, 1998 for the implementation of OU-II ROD.

In December 2002 the SAW Treatment System was placed into continuous operation to hydraulically capture the source area groundwater and remove VOCs. The system has been operating continuously since its startup in December 2002, with occasional shutdowns resulting from regional power outages and necessary system maintenance/repairs.

In its August 2004 FYR, EPA documented its approval of the temporary shutdown of the Ponderosa Treatment System, in favor of continued remediation by the SAW Treatment System. Pumping from the Ponderosa Treatment System ceased in November 2004.The sixth FYR was issued in June 2024 whch determined that the The remedy at the Vega Alta Public Supply Wells site is still protective of human health and the environment.
