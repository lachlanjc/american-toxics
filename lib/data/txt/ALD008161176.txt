### Background

The 730-acre Stauffer Chemical Co. (LeMoyne Plant) Superfund site is in Axis, Alabama. The Stauffer Chemical Co. (Cold Creek Plant) Superfund site is located next to the Site. The Site’s surroundings are primarily industrial land uses. The nearest residential property is a few miles from the Site. A water line connects residences and businesses to the public water supply. Stauffer began manufacturing hazardous chemicals at the Site in the 1950s. From 1965 to 1974, operations included discharging waste into an unlined landfill on the eastern side of the Site. In 1975, the landfill closed. From 1965 to 1979, Stauffer leased a small area on the western end of the site to Halby Chemical Company for manufacturing operations. Halby Chemical Company discharged waste into a pond on the southwest portion of the Site next to the Norfolk Southern rail line and eventually into Cold Creek Swamp. The EPA placed the Site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1984 because of contaminated groundwater, sediment and soil resulting from manufacturing operations. The EPA and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) Exit have investigated site conditions and the site’s responsible party (RP), Nouryon (former Specialty Chemical business of Akzo Nobel, Inc.) have taken steps to remediate the Site and ensure the Site is protective of human health and the environment.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Site consists of 3 operable units (OU): OU1 covers groundwater at the LeMoyne and Cold Creek Sites; OU2 cover source areas, and OU3 cover surface water and sediment at the LeMoyne and Cold Creek Sites. 1970s Contaminated groundwater was detected by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. Groundwater monitoring wells were installed; the north and south landfills along with the Old Neutralization Pond (ONP) were closed. 1980s Three intercept wells were installed along with a groundwater treatment system and air stripper (GWIP). 1984 The EPA listed the Site on the NPL. Nouryon currently owns the site property, manufactures carbon disulfide, sulfuric acid, and a propriety sulfur compound at the Site and leads site investigation and clean-up activities with oversight provided by the EPA and ADEM. Historical Remedial Investigations An RI for OU-1 conducted between 1986 and 1989, concluded that using the groundwater as a potable supply would result in human health risks and ecological risk to the wetland. Subsequent investigations were conducted in 1993. An RI for OU-2 was completed in 1997. Identified source areas include subsurface soils in the former Halby Pond area that had thiocyanate and cyanide. The OU-3 RI was completed in 1993 and identified elevated mercury concentrations in sediment in the upper arm swamp zone (UASZ) and the middle lower swamp transition zone (MLSTZ). Decision Documents The ROD for OU1 was signed in September 1989. A 1990's Consent Decree prohibits activities that would interfere with the groundwater remedy. The ROD for OU3 was signed in September 1993. The ROD for OU2 was signed in March 1999. An interim ROD for OU3 was signed in September 2010. 1992 -1994 The groundwater treatment system for OU-1 was modified to intercept groundwater near sources areas in an effort to decrease the remediation timeline. Additional Intercept wells were installed and directed discharge to the GWIP, and then to the Mobile River until 2002. 1999 Between September and December, Phase I of the Remedial Action for OU-2 was completed by excavating contaminated soil from the Old Neutralization Pond and placing it in a treatment cell (biopile). 2000 Phase 2 of the Remedial Action for OU-2 was completed between 2000 and 2004, during this time frame the biopile was operated. Material within the biopile had a 50% reduction in contaminant mass. 2001 Chemtura Corporation (the PRP for the former Halby Pond) completed a Remedial Design Work Plan. 2002 The local influence of pumping at the intercept wells and the Courtaulds North America (CNA) extraction wells (south of the LeMoyne Site) caused the groundwater flow to shift to flowing south/southeast instead of east toward the Mobile River. The CNA wells were shut down. 2006 Additional intercept wells were installed to capture new groundwater flow. Groundwater pump and treat system begins operations at AOC M to address carbon disulfide contamination. 2008 RCRA corrective actions are ongoing at two Areas of Concern (AOC A and AOC M) due to the presence of Dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPL) in groundwater. Groundwater injections and a soil vapor extraction (SVE) were implemented in these source areas. 2009 Chemtura Corporation filed for bankruptcy, and the Remedial Design Work Plan was not implemented. 2010 EPA updated the Site’s remedy for the Cold Creek Swamp (CCS) Operable Unit 3 (OU-3). The new clean-up plans included constructing an engineered cap over 17.5 acres of contaminated soil and sediment in the Upper Arm Swamp Zone (UASZ) as well as monitoring CCS to evaluate the effectiveness of the clean-up activities. 2012 The groundwater treatment system was shut down for maintenance and repairs. A rebound study was conducted to observe COC concentrations. COC exceedances were observed during a rebound study and groundwater monitoring has continued. 2013 Groundwater injections discontinued at AOC A and AOC M. 2014 A long-term monitoring plan (Performance Standard Verification Plan) was developed for the Cold Creek Swamp and includes the annual collection and analysis of fish tissue, surface water, soil, sediment, sediment trap and sediment anchor samples. 2015 Temporary perforated flushing lines were installed in the former Halby Pond area to increase the contaminant migration into the soil and groundwater. Construction of the 17.5-acre engineered cap for the Cold Creek Swamp began. 2016 The OU-3 Cold Creek Swamp cap was completed for the 17.5-acre area. The Site’s fourth Five-Year Review, completed in 2016, found that the cleanup for OU-1 groundwater remains protective of human health and the environment and the newly installed cap for OU-3 has eliminated exposure to contaminated sediments. Performance monitoring will be conducted to ensure the OU-3 remedy is protective. The cleanup for OU-2 will be protective of human health and the environment following completion of the remedy. 2018 The treated ONP soils were analyzed, and data revealed the concentrations were below the soil treatment performance standards. An ESD was approved that would allow the treated ONP soils to be removed from the biopile and placed in an off-site landfill instead of keeping the material on Site and constructing a RCRA Subtitle C cap over it, which was Phase 3 of the OU-2 Remedial Action. 2019 A Remedial Design Work Plan was approved for OU-2. 2021 An Remedial Design Work Plan Addendum for OU-2 was approved that included more Site studies that were needed. The Site's fifth Five-Year Review was completed in 2021 and found that the OU-1 groundwater is short-term protective: institutional controls are needed, and more groundwater investigations and optimizations of the current network are needed. The OU-2 remedy is expected to be protective after it is completed. Protectiveness at OU-3 is deferred, as additional sampling is needed in the Cold Creek Swamp. 2024 Investigations into the transition zone in the Cold Creek Swamp were initiated. A supplemental investigation revealed that source areas remain outside of the previously capped area, and a Remedial Design Work Plan for the Upper Arm Swamp Zone cap extension was approved. A groundwater optimization study was initiated for OU-1.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

A Fifth Five Year Review Addendum was completed, and has the following OU-3 recommendations: Additional investigations into upstream areas of the Cold Creek Swamp along with targeted removals; Full investigation into the Middle Swamp Zone and Lower Swamp Zone, and a review of the previous feasibility study and evaluation of remedy alternatives via a focused feasibility study; revaluation of the human exposure routes and potential risks in the Cold Creek Swamp; Reassess the need for a surface water-based cleanup/performance goal(s) for mercury and revise, as necessary; Reinstitute monitoring (surface water, sediment, fish tissue) within the Mobile River as part of the OU-3 remedy. The existing remedy at the Cold Creek Swamp was determined to be not protective at this time.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Long-Term Post-Remediation Monitoring for OU-3 is underway, and includes fish tissue, surface water, sediment trap, soil/sediment, and anchor tile samples. Samples are collected from several locations including the Upper Arm Swamp Zone (UASZ), Middle Lower Swamp Transition Zone (MLSTZ) and surrounding background areas. Baseline sampling for Year 0 (2014) before construction and Year 1 (2016) after construction as well as Year 2 (2017), Year 3 (2018), Year 4 (2019), Year 5 (2020), Year 6 (2022), Year 7 (2023), Year 8 (2024). The Year 9 report is expected May 2025. The objective is to evaluate the integrity of the engineered cap and its ability to perform to meet remedial goals.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

On August 3, 2018 the EPA entered a disbursement agreement to utilize funds received in the bankruptcy settlement to complete the remedial action at OU-2. The responsible parties continue to fund site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities for OU-1 and OU-3.
