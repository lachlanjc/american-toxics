Background
The 730-acre Stauffer Chemical Co. (LeMoyne Plant) Superfund site is located in Axis, Alabama. The Stauffer Chemical Co. (Cold Creek Plant) Superfund site is located next to the Site.  The Site’s surroundings are primarily industrial land uses. The nearest residential property is a few miles from the Site. A water line connects residences and businesses to the public water supply. Stauffer began manufacturing hazardous chemicals at the Site in the 1950s. From 1965 to 1974, operations included discharging waste into an unlined landfill on the eastern side of the Site. In 1975, the landfill closed. From 1965 to 1979, Stauffer leased a small area on the western end of the site to Halby Chemical Company for manufacturing operations. Halby Chemical Company discharged waste into a pond on the southwest portion of the Site next to the Norfolk Southern rail line and eventually into Cold Creek Swamp.
The EPA placed the Site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1984 because of contaminated groundwater, sediment and soil resulting from manufacturing operations. The EPA and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) Exithave investigated site conditions and the site’s responsible party (RP), Nouryon (former Specialty Chemical business of Akzo Nobel, Inc.) have taken steps to remediate the Site and ensure the Site is protective of human health and the environment.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In 1984, the EPA listed the Site on the NPL. Nouryon currently owns the site property, manufactures chemicals at the Site and leads site investigation and clean-up activities with oversight provided by the EPA and ADEM. 2010
EPA updated the Site’s remedy for the Cold Creek Swamp (CCS) Operable Unit 3 (OU-3). The new clean-up plan included constructing an engineered cap over 17.5 acres of contaminated soil and sediment in the Upper Arm Swamp Zone (UASZ) as well as monitoring CCS to evaluate the effectiveness of the clean-up activities. 2016
The Site’s fourth Five-Year Review, completed in 2016, found that the cleanup for OU-1 groundwater remains protective of human health and the environment and the newly installed cap for OU-3 has eliminated exposure to contaminated sediments. Performance monitoring will be conducted to ensure the OU-3 remedy is protective. The cleanup for OU-2 will be protective of human health and the environment following completion of the remedy.

What Is the Current Site Status?
Site investigations and clean-up activities have focused on three areas, which the EPA refers to as operable units, or OUs. These areas include OU-1: contaminated groundwater; OU-2: source contamination; and OU-3: contaminated surface water and sediment in Cold Creek Swamp (CCS). The Site’s long-term remedy for OU-1, selected in 1989, included continuing use of the existing groundwater treatment system; installing additional groundwater extraction wells; modifying the groundwater treatment system; and monitoring groundwater and the groundwater treatment system. The Site’s groundwater treatment system for OU-1 will continue to operate and treat groundwater until all contaminants of concern meet clean-up goals. The Site’s long-term remedy for OU-2, selected in 1999, included constructing a system to speed up the movement of contaminants from subsurface soil into groundwater; treating groundwater contamination with a groundwater treatment system; and placing an institutional control on the site property. One of the PRPs for OU-2, the Halby Chemical Company, filed bankruptcy and the EPA received a settlement to conduct the remaining cleanup. On August 3, 2018 the EPA entered a disbursement agreement to utilize funds received in the bankruptcy settlement to complete the remedial action at OU-2. Under this disbursement agreement, Nouryon is currently conducting a pilot study for OU-2.  The Site’s long-term remedy for OU-3, selected in 1993, included capping the soil in the Upper Arm Swamp Zone (UASZ) of CCS. Construction of the OU-3 17.5 acre engineered cap was completed in Fall 2015 and environmental monitoring is ongoing.
The EPA completed the last Five-Year-Review (FYR) in 2016 and plans to complete the next FYR in 2021.

Sampling and Monitoring
Long-Term Post-Remediation Monitoring for OU-3 is underway to include fish tissue, surface water, sediment trap, soil/sediment, and anchor tile samples. Samples are collected from several locations including the Upper Arm Swamp Zone (UASZ), Middle Lower Swamp Transition Zone (MLSTZ) and surrounding background areas. Baseline sampling for Year 0 (2014) before construction and Year 1 (2016) after construction as well as Year 2 (2017), Year 3 (2018) and Year 4 (2019) sampling has been conducted. Year 4 data is currently being analyzed. The objective is to evaluate the integrity of the engineered cap and its ability to perform to meet remedial goals during the next Five-Year Review in 2021.

Enforcement Information
Enforcing environmental laws is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws. On August 3, 2018 the EPA entered a disbursement agreement to utilize funds received in the bankruptcy settlement to complete the remedial action at OU-2. The responsible parties continue to fund site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities for OU-1 and OU-3. Top of Page
