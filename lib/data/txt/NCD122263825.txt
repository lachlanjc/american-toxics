### Background

The 13-acre JFD Electronics/Channel Master [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located at 620 West Industry Drive, two miles southwest of downtown Oxford in Granville County, North Carolina. Pine Tree Road borders the site to the north. West Industry Drive borders the site to the west. A Norfolk Southern rail line borders the site to the south. A residential area borders the site to the east. The residential area includes homes and an apartment complex, which includes low-income and minority residents.

From 1961 until 1984, an antenna, amplifier and booster manufacturing facility operated at the site. Beginning in 1964, operations disposed of sludge generated by treating wastewater from conversion and electroplating processes, primarily rinse water from a chromate conversion process and copper/nickel electroplating into an on-site lagoon covering approximately 23,400 square feet. and a packaging and distribution facility for electronic parts operated from 1984 to 2003.

Currently, the site is not in use, except for ongoing ground water treatment activities. The site includes the concrete slabs and foundations of two industrial buildings, the former Channel Master main building and the former Bandag Warehouse building.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1989 because of contaminated groundwater, sludge and soil resulting from operations and waste handling practices at the site. EPA, the [North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (NCDENR)](https://deq.nc.gov/), and the site’s [potentially responsible party (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

JFD Electronics Corporation and Channel Master Satellite Systems, Inc., the site’s PRPs, lead site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and NCDENR.

**1992**  
EPA selected the site’s long-term remedy. It included using a pump–and-treat system to address contaminated groundwater; treating groundwater on site using alkaline-chlorination, precipitation/filtration, air stripping and carbon adsorption; discharging treated groundwater to the local water treatment plant or a nearby surface water pathway; and monitoring groundwater. The plan also included excavating contaminated sludge and soil and treating on-site using reduction, oxidation and stabilization; backfilling treated sludge and soil in excavated areas on site; and capping the backfilled areas. The plan also included installing additional monitoring wells.

**1996**  
EPA updated the groundwater treatment approach, eliminating the alkaline-chlorination, precipitation/filtration and carbon adsorption treatment methods. In 1999, EPA revised the cleanup plan again, to include excavating 1,750 cubic yards of contaminated sludge and disposing of it off site at a treatment and disposal facility; converting hexavalent chromium in contaminated sludge to trivalent chromium; and stabilizing contaminated sludge to meet requirements for the off-site disposal facility.

**1998**  
The site’s PRPs began operating the groundwater pump-and-treat system in 1998. The PRPs temporarily suspended the system due to cyanide concentrations above surface water discharge criteria. The PRPs modified the system and restarted it in 2000. In addition, the PRPs dug up and transported contaminated soil and sludge off site for treatment and disposal; backfilled the dug-up areas with clean soil; compacted and sloped the area for proper drainage; and planted grass.

**2000**  
EPA revised cleanup plans for contaminated soil and sludge to include digging up and disposing of contaminated soil at an off-site landfill, backfilling the dug-up areas with clean soil, and grading and seeding the backfilled areas.

**2010**  
EPA prepared the site’s Second Five-Year Review in 2010 and recommended additional groundwater studies before a determination on the protectiveness of the cleanup could be made. EPA and the PRPs began the additional studies in 2011 and determined that the pump-and-treat system was not functioning as intended; the extent of the groundwater plume is not captured with the current system; and off-site contaminant migration is ongoing. Groundwater treatment and monitoring are ongoing. The PRPs are currently preparing a work plan to conduct additional investigations to address items noted in the 2010 Five-Year-Review and in the December 2012 investigation.

**2011**  
EPA reviewed the PRP’s evaluation of vapor intrusion at the Oak Ridge apartments Specifically, the review noted the presence of increase concentrations of chlorinated cvolatile organic compounds in the vicinity of the downgradient Oak Ridge property and requested a second vapor intrusion study. The results of the April 2013 indoor air, outdoor air and sub-slab vapor sampling in additional to the June 2013 groundwater sampliong results indicate that there not a complete groundwater to indoor air vapor intrusion pathway at Oak Ridge that could create a potential risk/hazard above EPA's target levels.

**2015**  
The RPM prepared an Amendment to the 1992 Record of Decision to include Institutional Controls (ICs) for soil and groundwater at the site. Perpetual Land Use Restrictions must be implemented in order to prohibit the use of groundwater within the footprint of the plume since groundwater Maximum Contaminant Levels have not been met. Also the modified remedy includes ICs for soils to prevent unacceptable residential exposure to contaminated soils remaining on-site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [fourth Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11014576.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2020. The remedy currently protects human health and the environment in the short term because no complete exposure pathways exist.

EPA and the site’s PRPs are working to address the issues identified in the third Five-Year Review. Ground water treatment and monitoring are ongoing.

As of 2019, the PRPs submitted a modification to the soil and groundwater monitoring program. The purpose of the modification is to ensure that both the short-term and long-term performance standards of the groundwater remediation system are met.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Zoning limits the site to industrial land use.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The PRPs submitted a Semi-annual Groundwater Remediation Report. The groundwater extraction system has been used to capture and contain groundwater, impacted with site-specific constituents, released at the site. As of 2019, a total of 124,075,066 gallons of groundwater has been treated at the site.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRPs to investigate and clean up the site. The PRPs continue to fund site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
