Background
The half-square-mile Sandy Beach Road Ground Water Plume site is a TCE-contaminated groundwater plume in Tarrant County, Texas. Disposal activities at a nearby dump site contaminated the plume with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The plume has affected three public water supply wells and at least 12 residential drinking water wells. Construction of the remedy is underway.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal and state actions. In March 2004, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) brought the site to EPA for investigation. In June 2004, TCEQ conducted investigations at the site under a grant from EPA Region 6. The investigations identified TCE in three public water supply wells and 12 residential drinking water wells.In March 2004, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) brought the site to EPA for investigation.
