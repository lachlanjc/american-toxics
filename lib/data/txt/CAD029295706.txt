Background
The Lorentz Barrel & Drum Co. site is located at the intersection of Alma Avenue and 10th Street in San Jose, California. A waste drum reconditioning and recycling facility operated on site from 1947 to 1987. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Most of the site’s cleanup has been completed. Site investigations and cleanup planning for a remaining source area of contamination are ongoing.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.EPA has prevented or limited human exposure at the site through the capping of the contaminated soil and the containment transect of extraction wells. With the completion of the FFS, EPA will have selected a remedy for remaining contamination on site. When this remedial action is completed, the site should be fully remediated and ready for closeout.

What Is the Current Site Status?
To date, EPA has prevented or limited human exposure at the site through the capping of the contaminated soil and the containment transect of extraction wells. Most of the cleanup at the site has been completed. There is a small amount of contamination remaining in the clay aquitard that is back diffusing and contaminating the groundwater. After this source area is remediated, it may take some time to treat the existing groundwater plume. When this remedial action is completed, the site should be fully remediated and ready for closeout. To address this source area, a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) was completed in 2023. This was a collaborative effort between EPA and the Lorentz Shallow Groundwater Task Force (LSGTF), whose members are potentially responsible parties (PRPs). The purpose of the FFS was to evaluate existing soil and groundwater remedies and other remedial options to determine the best technical approach to effectively and efficiently achieve all cleanup goals within a reasonable restoration period.
