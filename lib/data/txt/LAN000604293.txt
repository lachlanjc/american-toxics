### Background

The American Creosote DeRidder site is a 55-acre tract of land owned by Central Manufacturing Company (CMC) located south of the city of DeRidder, Beauregard Parish, Louisiana.

Historical timber treatment operations at the American Creosote DeRidder site have resulted in contamination by creosote related compounds. The Shreveport Creosoting Company operated a creosote timber treatment facility from the early 1920s to approximately 1945 on a parcel of land south of DeRidder, creosote operations were relocated from this tract of land in the mid-1940s, although other wood treatment procedures are reported to have continued until approximately 1957. From 1957 to 1992 the property remained dormant until its purchase by CMC in September 1992.

Soil, sediment and surface water are contaminated with waste from previous timber treatment activities including liquid pitch oil, tar oil and coal tar solutions. Wastes were collected in on-site concrete vats and pits. Soil, sediment and surface water at the site include numerous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs), and metals. A drip area, creosote processing basin area, waste pit and washout area were located on-site, and used during operations in the wood preserving pressure treatment process.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

A removal action initiated by EPA in March 2020 was completed on November 8, 2021. The removal action focused on the removal of source materials at the site which will prevent further release and migration of contaminants and reduce the threat to public health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA have initiated investigation of the site in order to determine the nature and extent of contamination.
