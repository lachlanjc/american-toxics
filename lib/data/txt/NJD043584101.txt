### Background

The Matlack, Inc. site is a 79-acre property along Route 322 in Woolwich Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey. The Matlack, Inc. site is bounded by Route 322 to the north, an open field to the south and east, and by Grand Sprute run to the west. Grand Sprute Run is an approximate 1.25-mile-long stream that drains into Raccoon Creek, which is south of the site. The Site consists of Matlack, Inc.’s (Matlack) former Swedesboro Terminal that occupied the northern portion of the parcel, as well as a portion of a parcel located immediately west and downgradient of the former terminal. The western portion of the property, owned by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, or NJDEP, is a part of the Raccoon Creek Wildlife Management Area.

From 1962 to 2001, the site housed Matlack's former Swedesboro Terminal, a terminal primarily used for cleaning trucks and tankers that transported various hazardous substances, including flammable and corrosive liquids. The contaminated cleaning solution was disposed of in an unlined lagoon behind the terminal building until 1976, when Matlack Inc. began storing wastewater in open-top, in-ground concrete tanks before transporting the wastewater away from the site for disposal. The lagoon was later filled with demolition debris and other material.

Although Matlack discontinued tanker cleaning operations in November 1997, it continued to service and store vehicles at the site until 2001, when it filed for bankruptcy. Today, the Swedesboro Terminal is operated by Coopersburg & Liberty Kenworth, a medium-and heavy-duty truck sales and service center.

The EPA listed the Matlack, Inc. site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in May 2013.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, or NJDEP launched an investigation into potential groundwater contamination at the Matlack, Inc. site in December 1982 because they had received reports of contamination in drinking water wells in the surrounding area. As part of this investigation, NJDEP sampled the groundwater, soil, surface water, and sediment at the site.

In May 1987, NJDEP and Matlack, Inc. entered into an Administrative Consent Order which required Matlack to clean up the areas considered the sources of contamination. Between 1990 and 2001, Matlack installed a groundwater treatment system consisting of extraction wells, an infiltration trench, and an aeration system and removed aboveground and underground storage tanks used for waste and petroleum. Matlack also dug up and removed contaminated soil off-site. NJDEP operated the groundwater treatment system from November 1995 to May 1997, and then again from June 2006 though 2011. In September 2011, at the request of EPA, NJDEP completed a site reassessment which concluded that sources of contamination requiring further action under CERCLA were still present at the site. By 2012, EPA began its own investigation, ultimately placing it on the NPL in 2013.

EPA investigated the site in three phases (in July 2015, March through May 2016, and July through August 2016) to further characterize the former waste disposal (lagoon) area and better understand the extent of the plume (a mass of contaminants in groundwater) contaminated with aromatic volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, and [4-chloroaniline](https://nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb/documents/fs/2964.pdf), and another plume contaminated with chlorinated [volatile organic compounds,](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/technical-overview-volatile-organic-compounds) or CVOCs. EPA collected samples of surface water, seep water, sediment, soil, and existing and newly installed groundwater monitoring wells during the investigation.

During sampling conducted in 2014 EPA identified elevated levels of additional VOCs, including [benzene](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts3.pdf), [tetrachloroethylene, or](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts18.pdf) PCE, [trichloroethylene,](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts19.pdf) or TCE, and total [xylenes](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts71.pdf), as well as elevated levels of SVOCs, such as benzyl butyl phthalate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, [di-n-octylphthalate](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts95.pdf) and naphthalene at two locations in the groundwater.

The Remedial Investigation report was completed in June 2017 andthe Feasibility Study report, which evaluates ways to cleanup the contamination present at the site, was completed in 2017.

EPA signed a Record of Decision, or ROD, in September 2017 which selected a cleanup plan for the site. The cleanup plan included:

- Installing two permeable reactive barriers, or PRBs, to address contaminated groundwater;
- Removing contaminated soil and sediment that are acting as a source of continued groundwater contamination;
- Regularly checking to make sure the cleanup is working effectively;
- Setting rules to limit the use of contaminated areas until the cleanup is complete

The cleanup plan targetsted contaminated groundwater and the discharge of groundwater that has affected surface water and sediment. Additionally, it would address the potential risks from inhaling indoor air contaminated by vapors that may enter a building or structure if constructed over the contaminated plumes.

**Pre-Design Investigation**

After issuing the 2017 ROD, EPA began conducting a Pre-Design Investigation, or PDI, to further define the extent of contamination in groundwater, soil and sediment. The PDI was condcuted in three phases from August 2019 to February 2022.

While the 2017 ROD identified the presence of two distinct plumes of groundwater contamination, EPA’s understanding at the time was that they were coming from the same source. However, based on the PDI, EPA concluded that the site has two distinct source areas and resultant plumes. The source of the southern CVOC plume was found to be related to the disposal of drums containing chlorinated solvents in an area south of the Former Lagoon Area. This area is now referred to as the Drum Disposal Area.

It was determined that the cleanup plans selected in the 2017 ROD would not sufficiently address source contamination found in the Drum Disposal Area, and that additional cleanup action is required to address this additional source of contamination. A Focused Feasibility Study, or FFS, was completed in July 2023 to evaluate remedial alternatives for the source contamination in the Drum Disposal Area and EPA released a Proposed Plan for public review on March 29, 2023. On August 7, 2023, EPA signed a ROD Amendment to memorialize the selected cleanup plan for the Drum Disposal Area which involves the use of in-situ thermal treatment to remove the contaminants from the contaminated soil. All other portions of the original 2017 ROD remain unchanged.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is currently completing the design of the soil portions of the remedies selected in the 2017 ROD and the 2023 ROD Amendment to address contamination at the site. The designs for the sources areas (soil excavation in the Former Lagoon Area and in-situ thermal treatment in the Drum Disposal Area) are currently being completed and finalized and will be completed in 2024. After a period of monitoring to access the impacts of removing the sources on the groundwater plumes, the groundwater and sediment portions of the remedy will be designed and implemented.
