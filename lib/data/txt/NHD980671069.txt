### Background

The South Municipal Water Supply Well Superfund site is located in Peterborough, New Hampshire. Installed in 1952, the South Municipal Water Supply Well provided water to Peterborough for nearly 30 years. On October 22, 1982, the New Hampshire Water Supply and Pollution Control Commission (now the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services) found over 100 parts per billion of total volatile organics in a sample of water from the South Well. At the recommendation of the EPA and the State, the Town of Peterborough discontinued the use of the South Well in December 1982. Subsequent investigations determined that solvent use and disposal at the NHBB facility had resulted in a plume of contaminated groundwater extending from under the NHBB property to the vicinity of the South Well. The principal solvents NHBB used and that were detected in the groundwater were tetrachloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA). The Site was added to the National Priority List on September 21, 1984.

The approximately 250-acre Site has been defined to include the South Municipal Water Supply Well (South Well), nearby commercial and residential properties along Sharon Road, a portion of the Contoocook River and U.S. Route 202, the adjacent wetlands, and the New Hampshire Ball Bearings (NHBB) property, which is located approximately two miles south of the center of the town of Peterborough in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire. The NHBB facility is situated approximately 1,200 feet west-northwest of the South Well and approximately 800 feet west of the Contoocook River. The NHBB property currently consists of an active manufacturing facility, asphalt parking lots, a groundwater treatment system, and sedge meadow wetlands.

The Site is situated in the Contoocook River Valley, on glacial/fluvial deposits ranging from approximately 20 to over 100 feet in thickness. Deposits are predominantly sands and gravels, although silty layers are found dispersed both vertically and horizontally throughout the Site. The general direction of groundwater flow is east-northeast in the vicinity of the NHBB plant and changes to a more northerly direction in the vicinity of the Contoocook River.

Land use in the vicinity of the Site, particularly east of the Contoocook River, is rural and undeveloped. A fitness center and several apartments are situated adjacent to, and south of, the NHBB property. Commercial establishments are located approximately 1,000 feet north and northwest of the South Well. Residences are located to the west of the NHBB property along Old Jaffrey Road and two residences are located proximate to the Contoocook River along Sharon Road.

The Site and adjacent area are served by a municipal water system that receives water from three wells located north of the town center. The closest residential wells are located approximately one-half mile north of the Site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA placed the Site on the Superfund National Priority List (NPL) in September 1984. A Record of Decision (ROD) for the Site was signed on September 27, 1989. The ROD called for a restriction on the use of the groundwater, in-situ vacuum extraction of contaminated soils, excavation and/or dredging with dewatering of sediments, wetlands restoration, groundwater extraction and treatment with air stripping and carbon columns for air emission control, and long-term environmental monitoring. A Unilateral Administrative Order for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the remedy became effective on July 9, 1990. New Hampshire Ball Bearings (NHBB), the party potentially responsible for the contamination, completed the design of the remedy that was approved by EPA on May 3, 1993.

An Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) was issued on May 6,1993, that documented modifications to the remedy, principally for air emission controls and sediment excavation. A second ESD issued on February 3, 1997, waived certain Federal Drinking Water Standards for groundwater due to a technical impracticability, from an engineering perspective, to restore portions of the contaminated groundwater beneath the NHBB property. This portion of contaminated groundwater is known as the “technical impracticability (TI) waiver area.” The desired outcome of the 1997 remedy change was to effectively capture and contain the contaminant plume within the TI Waiver Area while allowing the use of the South Well as a drinking water source.

Installation of the groundwater extraction and treatment system was completed in March 1994. The in-situ vacuum extraction system began operation in October 1994 but ceased operation in 1997 when the second ESD was issued. The 1997 ESD revised the remedy to hydraulically contain the contaminant plume located on the NHBB property within the TI Waiver Area. Monitoring of groundwater quality and water levels has continued throughout the remedial design, construction, and post-construction phases.

The Third Five-Year Review conducted for the Site determined that the hydraulic containment remedy was not functioning as effectively as intended by the ROD and subsequent ESDs. EPA determined the remedy was not protective of human health or the environment in part because it could not capture all portions of the contaminated groundwater while the South Well was operating and because groundwater contaminant levels in areas outside of the TI Waiver Area were still above drinking water standards.

To restore the use of the aquifer for water supply purposes, additional remedial technologies were evaluated and are summarized in the September 2009 Focused Feasibility Study for Source Mass Reduction and Plume Management (FFS). The FFS included the evaluation of several technologies designed to destroy or reduce known and suspected dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source area(s), as well as options to manage the remaining contaminant plume following source reduction measures.

In May 2010 and September 2010, EPA published the proposed plan for the revised remedy and the ROD Amendment, respectively. These documents were based, in part, upon the information and treatment scenarios presented in the FFS. The 2010 ROD Amendment modified the Site remedy to include in-situ thermal treatment of soil and groundwater within targeted source areas, in-situ bioremediation of the dissolved groundwater plume, and in-situ groundwater control and treatment via a permeable reactive barrier (PRB) wall.

The EPA in consultation with the NHDES approved the PRB wall design in December 2013. Construction of the PRB wall was completed in December 2014. Groundwater pumping and treatment for containment were stopped after the construction of the PRB wall was completed.

The EPA in consultation with the NHDES approved the thermal treatment design in December 2015. Electrical Resistance Heating (ERH) was selected as the thermal treatment technology. Thermal treatment activities were completed in November 2016.

Vapor intrusion (VI) investigations conducted during the fourth five-year review indicated that VI is an exposure route of concern on the NHBB property, but not in areas outside of the TI Waiver boundary. Indoor air sampling results collected inside the NHBB building identified contaminant concentrations exceeding NHDES and EPA screening values. Indoor air data was collected in 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. The data collected does not indicate an unacceptable vapor intrusion human health risk. This finding assumes that the Highbay SVE system and First Floor Inspection and Cafeteria Areas SSDS continue to operate. This finding also assumes that in the future, modifications to the HVAC system or NHBB facility in general do not cause lower air turnover rates than those that existed during the January 23, 2017 to February 2017 indoor air testing event. NHBB is required to submit annual reports to the USEPA and NHDES that demonstrate that the SVE and SSDS systems are still operational and the air turnover rates were no lower than what existed during the January 23 to February 1, 2017 test.

In October 2024, NHBB completed the installation of the replacement PRB after EPA determined that the existing PRB was not functioning as intended. The replacement PRB is designed to treat contaminated groundwater leaving the NHBB property.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [6th Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/01/100026865.pdf), completed in 2023, concluded that the existing PRB was not functioning as intended and additional action was required. In October 2024, NHBB completed the construction of a replacement PRB. Additionally, the first phase of pre-design investigation for Enhanced In-Situ Bioremediation (EISB) was completed in Fall 2023.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**

This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
