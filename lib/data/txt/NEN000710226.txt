Background
The PCE Carriage Cleaners Site consists of a former dry-cleaning operation which occupied 2110 and 2112 Franklin Street in Bellevue, Sarpy County, Nebraska. Waste generated at the Site was tetrachloroethylene (PCE). Approximately 4,000 to 18,000 pounds of waste PCE were generated at Carriage Cleaners from 1988 to 1992. Prior to operating as Carriage Cleaners, the property was occupied and used by Dobb's Cleaners, a separate corporate entity. Sampling conducted by the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy (NDEE) detected PCE in indoor air and in sub-slab samples above levels of health concern at commercial and residential properties in the vicinity of the former dry cleaner. Other related volatile organic compounds, including trichloroethlylene and chloroform, have been detected in indoor air. PCE, trichloroethylene, chloroform, and cis-1,2-dichloroethylene were detected in the groundwater. The EPA initiated a removal action in 2019 to address vapor migration into indoor air. This response included additional soil and groundwater sampling coupled with sub-slab and indoor air sampling. Vapor mitigation systems were installed in structures where detections exceeded safe levels for vapor inhalation. The EPA continues to conduct groundwater sampling to monitor contaminant migration and potential exposure risks. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Sampling conducted by the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy (NDEE) detected PCE in indoor air and in sub-slab samples above levels of health concern at commercial and residential properties in the vicinity of the former dry cleaner. Other related volatile organic compounds, including trichloroethlylene and chloroform, have been detected in indoor air. PCE, trichloroethylene, chloroform, and cis-1,2-dichloroethylene were detected in the groundwater. The EPA conducted a 2019 removal action at the site to address chlorinated solvent contamination. Thus far, EPA has substantially completed delineation of the groundwater and associated vapor plumes, and completed assessments of all accessible commercial and residential properties which may be impacted. Of the 85 properties in which sub-slab and indoor air samples were collected, 20 properties met the removal action criteria and have functioning vapor mitigations installed. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
The EPA continues to monitor contamination in soil and groundwater along with vapor intrusion concerns. Additional measures may be needed to further delineate and further assess contamination inthe source area and groundwater. Following these assessments, the EPA may mitigate any additional complete vapor intrusion pathways that were not identified and addressed during the removal/response action. The site is proposed for listing on the NPL in September of 2022. Top of Page
Emergency Response and Removal
A removal action began in 2019 and the following actions were taken: (a) delineation of groundwater contamination and assessment of associated vapor intrusion potential in residential and commercial buildings, (b) installation of vapor mitigation systems in properties with a complete exposure pathway and sub-slab vapor concentrations above applicable Removal Management Levels (RMLs), and (c) assessment of the magnitude and extent of source area to facilitate an evaluation of source removal and/or treatment measures to mitigate the threat of ongoing releases contributing to the plume of groundwater contamination. Thus far, the EPA has substantially completed delineation of the groundwater and associated vapor plumes, and completed assessments of all accessible commercial and residential properties which may be impacted. Of the 85 properties in which sub-slab and indoor air samples were collected, 20 properties met the removal action criteria and have functioning vapor mitigations installed. In April 2021, subsurface sampling confirmed the source of contamination at the former Carriage Cleaners facility property. Sampling included Membrane Interface Probe (MIP) screening, soil core sampling, and groundwater sampling. PCE was identified at high concentrations (in the range of 4 million parts per billion, or 4%) which indicates the likely presence of dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL). Due to the physical limitations of sampling equipment onsite during this assessment, the vertical and horizontal extent of source material was not fully delineated, but enough data was collected to estimate the boundaries, which are likely localized around the former dry cleaner property and are known to extend greater than 70 feet below ground surface.

Enforcement Information
No enforcement actions have been taken at this time. All response actions to date were completed as EPA fund lead.
