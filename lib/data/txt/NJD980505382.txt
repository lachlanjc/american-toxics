### Background

The Lang Property site is located in Pemberton Township, New Jersey. Two acres of the 40-acre area were used as an illegal dumping ground for abandoned vehicles, tires and other debris. In 1975, between 1,200 and 1,500 drums of unidentified chemical waste were discovered on the property. The owners removed the drums in 1976. Before their removal, the drums were emptied into unlined pits or the contents were spilled on the ground. EPA put the site’s long-term remedy in place. Long-term groundwater monitoring is ongoing.

The property was purchased by Edward and Florence Lang in 1970. In June 1975, 1,200 to 1,500 drums of unidentified chemical waste were discovered in a clearing at the end of the unpaved road leading to the site. In 1976, prompted by state legal action, the Langs hired a local contractor to remove the drums and contaminated soils from the site. Prior to their removal, however, the contents of the drums were apparently spilled onto the ground or disposed of in what have historically been described as "on-site lagoons."

From 1977 through most of 1979, repeated sampling by the Burlington County Health Department and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) determined that groundwater at the site was contaminated. After additional investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Long-term Cleanup: EPA selected a remedy in the site’s September 1986 Record of Decision, or ROD. It included: (1) excavation of contaminated soils and waste materials and disposal at an approved off-site landfill facility; (2) restoration of the excavated area, including the removal of surface debris as necessary; (3) installation of a security fence to restrict site access; (4) extraction and on-site treatment of contaminated groundwater, with reinjection of the treated water; and (5) appropriate environmental monitoring to ensure the effectiveness of the remedial action.

About 13,200 tons of contaminated soils, two dozen crushed drums and other site debris were disposed of off-site at an approved facility in 1988. The excavated soil area was backfilled with clean fill, graded and seeded. Site fencing was also installed. Groundwater treatment took place from September 1995 to December 2006; about 307 million gallons of groundwater were treated at the site.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in a single, long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.  

Soil cleanup was completed in November 1988. The excavated soil area was backfilled with clean fill, graded and seeded. Site fencing was also installed.

Groundwater treatment took place from September 1995 to December 2006.  

Long-term groundwater monitoring is ongoing.
