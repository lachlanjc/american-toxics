### Background

The 12-acre Pinette's Salvage Yard site is an auto repair and salvage facility on Gardner Creek Road in Washburn, Maine.

In June 1979, three electrical transformers from Loring Air Force Base near Limestone, Maine, were removed from the base under a written agreement with a private electrical contractor. Allegedly, the transformers were brought to the site, where they apparently ruptured while being removed from the delivery vehicle. About 900 to 1,000 gallons of dielectric fluid containing PCBs spilled directly onto the ground.

In April 1980, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (ME DEP) determined that the site was contaminated with PCBs and associated VOCs. Additional sampling by ME DEP in August 1981 and EPA in May 1982 confirmed the presence of PCB contamination at the site.

EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1983. EPA’s cleanup work included removal of contaminated soil and on-site ground water treatment. EPA took the site off the NPL in September 2002.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA addressed the site in two stages. The first stage involved soil excavation and disposal. EPA removed about 800 cubic yards of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated soil and debris during the fall of 1983.

The second stage, the site’s longer-term cleanup, focused on the removal of more contaminated soil and treatment of contaminated ground water. The cleanup began in 1991 in which 410 cubic yards of highly contaminated soil were excavated and incinerated off site. Cleanup continued with on-site treatment in 1992, but poor results from this work led EPA to change the cleanup approach in 1993 to allow for off-site disposal of remaining soil. Cleanup activities were finished later that year. In total, 1,005 tons of soil were incinerated, 20 tons of soil were treated using solvent extraction, and 5,103 tons of soil were disposed of in an off-site regulated landfill.

Studies showed that the initial pumping of more than one million gallons of contaminated ground water had reduced the concentration of contaminants to a level that did not require active treatment. However, because some residual level of ground water contamination remains, EPA placed a deed restriction on the site in 2002 to prohibit installation of a drinking water well on site. Cleanup finished in September 2002.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted several [five-year reviews](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0101036&doc=Y&colid=33003&region=01&type=SC) of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**  
  
This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.  
  
The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
