### Background

The 28-acre Hagen Farm site, 2318 County Highway A in unincorporated Dunkirk Township, is approximately one mile east of the city of Stoughton, Wisconsin. About 10 acres were used as a sand and gravel pit prior to the late 1950s and then used for disposal of waste materials through the mid-1960s. Waste from chemicals, including vinyl chloride and tetrahydrofuran, contaminated soil and groundwater.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA approved a document in 2017 called an [Amended Record of Decision (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/541525) (42 pp, 217MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) that outlines EPA’s new cleanup plan.

This new cleanup plan has been implemented by Waste Management of Wisconsin, one of the companies connected to the site. It officially changes the original groundwater cleanup plan from pump-and-treat to a technology called low flow air sparge. This new technology was tested in 2000 and eventually replaced the pump-and-treat system.

This plan will protect people and the environment, provide long-term effectiveness, comply with state and federal environmental regulations, can be easily implemented, and is cost-effective.

Waste Management originally cleaned up about 68,000 cubic yards of waste, including municipal refuse, paint sludge, grease, rubber, plastic sheeting, and industrial chemicals in the 1990s.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is doing a status review of the cleanup. This type of review is required at least every five years where the cleanup is complete but hazardous waste remains managed on-site. These reviews are done to ensure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This is the sixth five-year review. Contact the site community involvement coordinator and/or the remedial project manager to provide input on this review process.  
  
The review will include:  
• An evaluation of background information  
• A summary of cleanup requirements  
• A report on the effectiveness of the cleanup and any anticipated future actions  
• An analysis of ways for EPA to operate more efficiently

A report, which will be available by July 2021, will detail the site's progress.
