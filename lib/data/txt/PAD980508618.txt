### Background

H ranica Landfill Superfund Site is located in Buffalo Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania and consists of approximately 15 acres of undeveloped woodland and open space surrounded by a fence with a locking access gate.The landfill was privately owned and operated on the site from 1966 to 1974. By 1981, the site contained drums and other larger vessels of waste consisting of chlorinated solvents, paint pigments and metal sludge. Historically, the site was used as a mixed waste landfill and received both municipal and hazardous waste. These disposal activities contaminated groundwater and soil with hazardous chemicals. The Site was proposed to the National Priorities List (NPL) on December 30, 1982 and listed on the NPL on September 8, 1983.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s long-term remedy included fencing; capping of remaining contaminated soil; long-term groundwater and surface water monitoring; and land and groundwater use restrictions. Remedy construction took place in 1993.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The remedy construction has been completed and the site was deleted from the National Priorities List in 1997.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent, [2022 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2327242), concluded that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2027.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional Controls are in placed to restrict groundwater use and excavation or drilling of any type. Additional information about the ICs are available in the [2022 Five-Year Review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2327242) (page 6).

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions in 1983 and 1984 included removal of all drums and visibly contaminated soils.
