### Background

The Martin Aaron, Inc. site is in Camden, New Jersey. Various steel drum reconditioning companies operated at the site for approximately 30 years, ending in 1998. Industrial activity at the site contaminated soil and groundwater with arsenic, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), volatile organic compounds, and other chemicals.

Multiple companies used the property for light industrial activities since at least 1886. Until around 1940, hide tanning, glazing, and related operations occupied the site and neighboring properties. Martin Aaron, Inc., purchased the property in 1968 and operated a drum recycling business on site until 1987. In 1985, Westfall Ace Drum Company (WADCO), also known as Drum Services of Camden, and Rhodes Drums, Inc., began operating at the site. WADCO occupied the main on-site building, while Rhodes Drums operated from a smaller building in the southeastern corner of the property. WADCO was liquidated in bankruptcy proceedings in 1994.

The steel drum reconditioning operations involved draining drums into tanks and pressure-washing, steam-rinsing and drying, sand-blasting, and repainting the drums. Residues from drum contents, rinsate, and steam blow-down drained from tanks and floor drains into skimming basins. Sludge was skimmed from the basins for off-site disposal and acidic water was neutralized and reused in the plant. The process also generated baghouse dust from sand blasting and spray paint wastes.

Beginning in 1971, EPA and NJDEP issued numerous violation notices to operators at the site, primarily related to illegal discharges of waste and improper storage of drums. Anonymous reports claimed that drums and other containerized waste were buried on the property. The skimming basins were designed to discharge excess wastewater after pH adjustment to the combined sanitary/storm sewer system. However, EPA suspected that some of the effluent discharged directly to the subsurface. The operations at the site used numerous aboveground and underground storage tanks. Most of the vacant land was used for drum storage.

EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List in 1999, following removal operations and initial site assessment and investigation.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1987, Martin Aaron, Inc. removed approximately 45 drums of contaminated soil for off-site disposal.

In 1999, EPA and the NJDEP removed abandoned process equipment and drums, aboveground and underground storage tanks, and contaminated surface soils.

In July 2005, EPA concluded a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine the nature and extent of the contamination and evaluate remedial alternatives.

In September 2005, EPA selected the remedy for the site in the Record of Decision. The remedy included excavating contaminated soils and sending soils to an approved off-site disposal facility. Residual soil contamination was capped and future use of the site is restricted.

The Responsible Party began the cleanup in 2016 and completed the excavation and disposal of contaminated soils in November 2018. Capping of the site was completed in December 2019.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is capped and secured with a fence. The Responsible Party is investigating the extent of groundwater contamination and will use this information to refine the remedy for the groundwater contamination.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Residental Use Prohibition and deed notices are in place to restrict the use of the property.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The Responsible Party is investigating the extent of groundwater contamination and will use this information to refine the remedy for the groundwater contamination.
