### Background

The Metal Bank Superfund Site, a ten-acre property on the Delaware River, is a former scrap metal and transformer salvage facility located at 7301 Milnor Street in an industrial area of northeast Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The site is bordered by Cottman Avenue on the west; Milnor Street on the north; a recycling company and salvage yard on the east; and the Delaware River on the south. A stormwater outfall owned by the City of Philadelphia at the southern end of Cottman Avenue empties into a mudflat west of the Metal Bank Site. The Quaker City Yacht Club is located west of the mudflat.

Metal Bank of America, Inc. drained oil from used transformers to reclaim copper parts. Metal Bank's recycling operations released oil in various locations on the property with the majority of the contamination in the vicinity of an underground storage tank (UST) which was used to store the used transformer oil.

The Metal Bank Site includes two areas: the southern area which consists of approximately six acres of open area that was used for scrap metal recovery; and the northern area which consists of one vacant steel building, a courtyard, and a parking area. A fence is maintained around the entire site.

The site was proposed to the National Priorities List (NPL) on December 30, 1982, and formally added to the list on September 8, 1983.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In the 1970's the U.S. Coast Guard documented releases of oil to the Delaware River and traced the oil slicks to the site. In the early 1980's, the owner of the property installed and operated an oil recovery system to remove the PCB-contaminated oil from the groundwater. The recovery system operated until early 1989.

In 1983, the site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) for federal cleanup. In 1987, EPA identified potentially responsible parties (PRPs), all of which were utility companies. The PRPs formed a committee and signed an agreement with EPA in 1991 to investigate the site. The PRPs conducted an investigation of the property and evaluated different cleanups. The site owners declined to join this group.

In 1995, EPA proposed a plan to clean up the site by removing contaminated soils and collecting PCB-contaminated oil to prevent its release into the Delaware River. EPA issued its [Record of Decision (ROD) (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/115116) describing the cleanup in December 1997. In addition, EPA made changes to the ROD by issuing two Explanation of Significant Differences (ESDs), [September 2000 ESD (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/309770) and [December 2000 ESD (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/309779).

In 1998, EPA issued an enforcement order to 13 PRPs (ten utility companies and the site owners) to design and construct the cleanup. In September 2002, the utility group submitted a design report for the cleanup of the site. EPA approved the final design in January 2003, but the remedy in the design was not implemented due to litigation.

A revised remedy was documented in a Consent Decree, which was entered by the Court on March 14, 2006. The revised remedial design was approved by EPA in February 2008. The remedy included the following construction projects:

- excavation and backfill of specific areas in the courtyard and southern section;
- remove and dispose of the underground storage tank;
- install sheet pile wall;
- excavate sediments in Delaware River;
- install marine mattresses to cap sediments in the Delaware River;
- install a trench;
- install six monitoring wells;
- cover the southern area with geotextile and 24 inches of soil with a specific area covered with 48 inches of cover; and
- cover the courtyard area with geotextile and 12 inches of soil.

The Preliminary Close-out Report (PCOR) was signed in March 2010, signaling the construction completion at the Metal Bank Site. A construction completion site is a Superfund Site where physical construction of all cleanup actions are complete. Presently, maintenance and monitoring activities are being performed to ensure long-term protectiveness of the site.

In 2014, EPA issued a third [Explanation of Significant Differences (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2179961) to select additional Institutional Controls to protect the integrity of the remedy at the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has conducted two five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent, [2018 Five-Year Review (PDF),](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2260598) finds that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The contaminated soil and sediment were excavated and/or capped, Building 7 was sealed with epoxy, institutional controls are in place for the upland property, and long-term monitoring is being performed. For the remedy to be protective over the long-term, the institutional controls required by the [2014 Explanation of Significant Differences (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2179961) must be implemented. The next five-year review is scheduled for 2023.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

Institutional controls required by the Record of Decision have been implemented by a "deed restriction" that the former owner of the upland portion of the site filed with the Recorder of Deeds for the City of Philadelphia, PA in September of 2002.

These institutional controls include:

1. A prohibition on the use of the upland portion of the site for residential and agricultural uses;
2. A prohibition on the use of groundwater at the site for domestic (potable) purposes including drinking water; and
3. A prohibition on excavation on the upland portion of the site at depths that encounter the water table, contaminated soils and/or sediments beneath the soil cover, or that compromise the stability of soil covered areas along the Delaware River.

Additional information about the institutional controls are available in the [2018 Five-Year Review (PDF)](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2260598) (pages 8-9).

### Enforcement Information

In May 1998, the court lifted the stay on an original lawsuit, and EPA amended its complaint against the site owners to add a claim to recover its response costs under CERCLA. The trial was phased as follows: Phase One would determine whether defendants were liable and whether response costs were incurred by the Government; Phase Two would determine whether the Government's response costs, if any, were reasonable and recoverable, as well as the scope of any further remedial action; and Phase Three would determine the liability, if any, of the third-party defendants.

On January 21, 2003, in an 84-page opinion in United States v. Union Corporation, et al., Civil Action No. 80-1589, U.S. District Judge James T. Giles ruled on Phase One of the trial that the former and current site owners – Union Corporation, Metal Bank of America Inc., and former Metal Bank owners and officers Irving Schorsch and John Schorsch – are liable for EPA's costs related to the cleanup of the Site, located at 7301 Milnor Street in Philadelphia. The trial for Phase II was set for November 2004. The corporate defendants Union Corporation, Metal Bank of America, Inc., subsequently filed for bankruptcy in May 2003. EPA settled with the corporate defendants in the bankruptcy proceeding in November 2003. The November 2004 trial did not proceed as planned. Instead, the parties entered mediation in early 2004 and three consent decrees were entered and finalized on March 13, 2006. One of the Consent Decrees required a group of utility companies to implement the remedy at the Site. Under the term and conditions of that Consent Decree, a revised final design specified the details of the cleanup activities. This revised design was approved with comments on February 28, 2008.
