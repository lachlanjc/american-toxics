### Background

The 58-acre General Tire & Rubber Co. (Mayfield Landfill) site is located two miles north of Mayfield, Kentucky. It includes the area where the General Tire and Rubber Company (General Tire) disposed of manufacturing waste from 1970 to 1984. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1990 because of contaminated groundwater resulting from the landfill. EPA, the Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection (KDEP) and Continental Tire North America, the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP), investigated site conditions. After careful evaluation, EPA concluded that the landfill does not pose an unacceptable risk to people or the environment and did not require cleanup under the Superfund program. In 2000, EPA took the site off the NPL. The PRP continues to monitor groundwater at the site in coordination with KDEP.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is a landfill located east of State Highway 45, two miles north of Mayfield in Graves County, Kentucky. The landfill is next to the former General Tire manufacturing plant, between the Paducah/Louisville Railroad and Mayfield Creek. Mayfield Creek is located 150 yards from the eastern edge of the landfill. Most of the surrounding area is farmland.

The General Tire plant started operating in the early 1960s. Throughout its operations, the plant manufactured automobile, truck and tractor tires. In 1970, following approval from the Commonwealth of Kentucky (the State), General Tire constructed a landfill at the site. Between 1970 and 1979, General Tire disposed of an estimated 152 tons of hazardous wastes in trenches at the site.

- In 1981, General Tire began a groundwater monitoring program in compliance with a state request.
- General Tire continued to dispose of non-hazardous waste at the landfill until late 1984 under a state permit.
- In 1985, the State approved a closure plan for the landfill. The plan consisted of covering the trenches with two feet of clean soil and monitoring groundwater for a two-year period after General Tire completed construction of the cover. In 1985, General Tire covered and seeded the landfill.
- In 1990, EPA listed the landfill on the NPL. The landfill is currently vacant. In 1987, Continental Tire purchased General Tire, eventually becoming Continental Tire North America, and continued to operate the plant.
- The plant closed in October 2006.
- The site’s PRP led site investigation activities, with oversight provided by EPA and KDEP.
- In 1985, the PRP covered and seeded the landfill.
- EPA took the site off the NPL in 2000.
- Five-Year Reviews are no longer required for the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In 1993, EPA issued a site cleanup plan that determined that no further action was warranted. EPA based its decision on the data collected from the in-depth site investigation and estimated health risks. EPA further explained that the six groundwater extraction wells that deliver non-contact cooling water to the adjacent General Tire plant provides a significant level of protection to human health and the environment. The wells prevent the spread of any contaminants potentially released into the groundwater. EPA deferred the site to KDEP to continue monitoring groundwater and to evaluate groundwater if plant operators shut down the extraction wells.  

Continental Tire North America continues to monitor groundwater at the site in coordination with KDEP.
