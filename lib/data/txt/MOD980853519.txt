Background
The Lee Chemical Superfund Site is located in a rural industrial area near the southern edge of Liberty, Clay County, Missouri. The site is located about 0.70 mile east of Missouri Highway 291 and two miles north of the Missouri River in the relatively flat alluvial plain. The site property is roughly 2.5 acres in size and is enclosed by a chain link fence with a locked gate to limit access.
The city of Liberty has owned the site property since the early 1900s and operated a water treatment plant on the property from 1920 until 1962. The city of Liberty leased the property to the Lee Chemical Company from 1965 to 1975. Lee Chemical packaged and distributed solvents and arranged for the disposal of chemicals from various commercial companies. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In 1977, under the direction of the EPA and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MoDNR), the city of Liberty disposed of the hazardous materials found at the site in an appropriate landfill. In 1979, low levels of 1,1,2-Trichloroethylene (TCE) were detected in the raw water from the new well field; however, TCE was below detection levels in the final water treated by the treatment plant. Due to the detected TCE contamination in the existing wells, public wells PW #1 and PW #2 were installed in 1980. Due to the continued detections of TCE in the raw water supply, a Remedial Action Plan was finalized by the city of Liberty in 1982 and work under the plan was completed in 1983. In 1983, the city of Liberty with the MoDNR oversight initiated additional actions to remediate the site and reduce the TCE contamination in the raw water supply wells. These actions were carried through early 1989, the start of the Remedial investigation/Feasibility Study. On March 21, 1991, the Record of Decision (ROD) for the site was finalized and signed. The remedy for the site included 1) the on-site in-situ aqueous soil washing system; 2) the extraction and discharge of blended groundwater by EX-1 and PW#2 to a single permitted discharge location; 3) the sampling and monitoring of the soil washing and extraction systems; and 4) conducting groundwater and surface water sampling and reporting with monthly and quarterly progress reports to assess the effectiveness of the remedial action. On March 23, 1992, the MoDNR and the city of Liberty entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to conduct the Remedial Design/Remedial Action (RD/RA) in accordance with the ROD. The city of Liberty agreed to perform the RD/RA pursuant to the AOC and Statement of Work (SOW) for the site’s soil and groundwater contamination. The remedial action for the site included one on-site extraction well (EX-1) and one off-site extraction well (PW #2), an on-site in-situ aqueous soil washing system, and a network of groundwater monitoring wells. The remedial action was constructed in 1993 and operated until it was shut down in September 2015 to conduct additional soil investigations. The extraction well PW #2 was converted back in to use as a municipal well in May 2013. On March 26, 1994, the site’s remedial action achieved construction complete, and was determined to be operational and functional. Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
Five-Year Reviews The EPA conducts Five-Year Reviews (FYR) to evaluate the protectiveness for remedial actions where hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants remain above levels that allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. The EPA completed the fifth and most recent FYR at the site on July 10, 2024, and issued the following sitewide protectiveness statement: Protectiveness Statement: The selected remedy currently protects human health and the environment because engineering controls prevent access to site and groundwater sampling indicates nearby drinking water supply wells remain below MCLs for site contaminants. To be protective in the long-term, a new remedy needs to be implemented from the Focused Feasability Study. In the interim, the city of Liberty supply well monitoring network must be sampled regularly to ensure city drinking water remains below MCLs.. The next FYR is due on July 10, 2029, five years after the signature of the last FYR report. On September 30, 2021, the MoDNR sent the city of Liberty a notification of additional response action. The city responded by initiating a focused feasibility study to evaluate potential changes to the previously selected remedy. The focused feasibility study is ongoing. Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
Groundwater and public water supply wells are sampled on a monthly basis to monitor site related contaminants.

Enforcement Information
The state of Missouri and the city of Liberty signed a Consent Order in March 1992. Under the terms of the order, the city is responsible for the implementation of cleanup activities under state supervision. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources is responsible for Future Five-Year reviews of the site’s remedy. Top of Page
