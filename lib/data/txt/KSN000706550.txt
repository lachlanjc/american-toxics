### Background

The Cherokee Zinc - Weir Smelter site is part of the Tri‐State Mining District where mining, milling and smelting of lead and zinc ore began in the mid‐1800s and continued for more than 100 years.

The site is located in the city of Weir, Cherokee County, Kansas, in the Arkansas-White-Red Region watershed. The Chicago Zinc Works began smelting zinc in 1873, locating at Weir where there were nearby commercial coal deposits to fuel the smelter and to the proximity to the Tri-State lead and zinc mining district. According to historical information, smelting operations closed in approximately 1918, when natural gas wells in other areas of Kansas made smelter operations using coal less profitable.

Between 2004 and 2013, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment conducted soil sampling at the former smelter as well as nearby properties. Lead was identified as the potential primary contaminant of concern. This sampling identified several properties with elevated lead levels, and the KDHE requested the EPA to further evaluate residential lead contamination in Weir associated with the former Cherokee Zinc smelter. These investigations have identified elevated levels of lead in residential yards in Weir that appear to be attributable to the former Cherokee Zinc smelter. A site-wide remedial investigation is currenly underway at the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

To date, the EPA removal program has cleaned up 54 properties with lead above the Removal Management Levels. The removal assessment also concluded that soil, sediment and surface water were likely contaminated with lead, arsenic, cadmium and possibly selenium, on or adjacent to, the former smelter property. All short-term threats where known lead contamination poses a threat to the residents of Weir were addressed by the removal action. Long-term threats are being assessed through a Remedial Investigation, currently being performed at the site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA is currently performing a Remedial Investigation at the Cherokee Zinc-Weir Smelter site.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The EPA continues to sample private drinking water wells, residential and non-residential properties throughout the county. For more information, please contact [EPA Site Contacts](https://usepa.sharepoint.com/sites/OSWER_Work/SFCEF/SitePages/previewContacts.aspx?SiteID=0706550).
