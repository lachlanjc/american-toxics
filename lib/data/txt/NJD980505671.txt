### Background

The Monroe Township Landfill is located in Middlesex County, New Jersey. The landfill operated on an 86-acre area from 1955 to 1978. Monroe Township was the original owner and operator of the landfill and continues to own the site property. The Township operated the landfill from the mid-1950s until 1968, when it was leased to Princeton Disposal Service for operation under a service contract to Monroe Township. Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc. acquired Princeton Disposal Service in 1972 and operated the landfill until 1978. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) ordered the site’s closure in 1978 when leachate seeped onto Lani Street. Based on NJDEP’s documentation, only municipal and household waste was placed in the landfill. Landfill operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1979, the State of New Jersey ordered the landfill closed and installation of a leachate collection system.

A compacted clay dike and leachate collection system were constructed in the in the northeastern section of the landfill in 1980.

After a site investigation, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983.

Construction of landfill control measures were completed in 1984 and included: (1) installition of a leachate cut-off wall of varying depths around the landfill perimeter; (2) construction of an underground leachate collection drain; (3) leachate discharge into the sewer for treatment at the public wastewater treatment facility; and (4) installation of a clay cover to reduce the spread of contaminants.. The leachate is discharged to the Middlesex County Sewage Authority's Old Bridge Sewage Treatment Plant.

In 1991, the existing leachate lagoon was decommissioned, and was replaced with an underground storage tank. A standby generator was installed to handle leachate collection in the event of a power failure, and a fence was installed around the perimeter of site.

A remedial investigation regarding potential off-site groundwater contamination was completed in January 1992. This investigation indicated that site-related contaminants would not affect off-site wells.

These cleanup actions at the site have greatly reduced the potential for exposure to hazardous wastes. In 1993 NJDEP selected "no further action" with continued monitoring for the site. EPA deleted the site from the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in February 1994.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The reviews concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the selected remedy and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. Long-term monitoring is ongoing.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The 6th Five Year Review (FYR) was completed in November 2024. That FYR indicated that the remedies in place at the time of the Record of Decision are working as designed and remain protective of human health and the environment. While yearly monitoring and maintenance continues, EPA's next FYR is scheduled for 2029.
