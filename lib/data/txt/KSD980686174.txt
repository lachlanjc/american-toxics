### Background

The Big River Sand site is located in Wichita, Kansas. The site property covers 123 acres, and about half of which was extensively mined for sand and gravel.

The EPA has deleted the site from the National Priorities List (NPL). This Site Profile Page will remain available to inform the public that no further cleanup activities are anticipated and no additional Five-Year Reviews will be conducted.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

A Removal Action was conducted from 1982 to 1984 to dispose of hazardous paint sludges and solvent from the site.

The site was placed on the Superfund program's National Priorities List on June 10, 1986.

The EPA issued a Record of Decision on signed June 28, 1988. The ROD selected No Further Action as the final remedy for the Big River Sand Company site.

The site was deleted from the NPL on October 14, 1992.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Five-Year Reviews

The EPA conducts Five-Year Reviews to evaluate the protectiveness for remedial actions where hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants remain above levels that allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. The EPA completed the second and most recent FYR at the site on March 26, 2004, and issued the following protectiveness statement:

Site-wide: Because the remedial actions are protective, the site is protective of human health and the environment. The groundwater concentrations have reduced to below the MCL for selenium.

The EPA concluded that contamination no longer existed at the site above levels that allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure; therefore, FYRs were no longer required. The EPA discontinued FYRs at the site after the second FYR was completed in 2004.
