### Background

The Farmers’ Mutual Cooperative Site is located in Hospers, Iowa. Farmers' Mutual Cooperative, an agricultural supply and service business, is now operating under the name of Midwest Farmers' Cooperative. The business has been operating at the six-acre site since 1908. Bulk fertilizer and pesticides were handled at the site until 1992. The area continues to be used for grain storage. In 1984, the state of Iowa found pesticides and carbon tetrachloride in groundwater from three shallow municipal wells next to the site. The state restricted and then prohibited the use of these wells. Investigations found groundwater contamination in the relatively small area between the site and the Floyd River. Following monitoring, the EPA removed the site from the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2001.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site has been addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

The EPA conducted several Five-Year Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect human health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by the EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. Therefore, Five-Year Reviews are no longer required for this site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Natural attenuation has resulted in significantly decreased levels of contaminants in groundwater, and pesticide concentrations are below health-based standards. Natural attenuation involves a variety of processes that, under favorable conditions, act without human intervention to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume or concentration of contaminants in groundwater. Because the city of Hospers has abandoned the use of the three shallow city wells and connected to the Hospers rural water system for their water supply, there is no longer any threat to public health.
