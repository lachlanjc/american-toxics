### Background

The 7,382-acre Naval Air Engineering Center (NAEC)-Lakehurst site is located in Lakehurst, New Jersey. It has been used continuously for research, maintenance, firefighter training, testing and disposal activities by the U.S. Navy since the 1920s. Although the size of the Lakehurst facility and its operations have changed over the years, its major function has remained the development and testing of fleet support systems. As a result of 2005 Base Realignment and Closure legislation, the Navy site was realigned, along with McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix to become Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL), uniquely capable of projecting air, land and sea power to support national defense and is now under the Air Force. The major function of JBMDL-Lakehurst has remained development and testing of fleet support systems.The Navy identified 44 potentially contaminated areas at the site. The areas included landfills, open pits, unlined lagoons and drainage ditches. Construction of many of the site's long-term remedies have been completed. Groundwater treatment and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Since 2009, the site has been addressed by the Air Force through federal actions and is participating in the Installation Restoration Program (IRP). The program was established and is funded by the Department of Defense (DoD) to identify, investigate and control the migration of hazardous contaminants at military facilities.

**Areas A and B:** Based on the 1988-90 study and follow-up investigations, significant groundwater contamination was found in these two areas. NAEC and EPA selected an interim remedy – groundwater pumping and treatment – for the areas in the site’s March 1992 Record of Decision (ROD). NAEC and EPA selected the final remedy in the site’s July 1997 ROD. It called for minor modifications to the pump-and-treat system and the addition of an air sparging system to enhance plume remediation at the downgradient edge of the plume. Contaminant concentrations have declined over time and the groundwater treatment facility is no longer operating. The Air Sparging/Soil Vapor Extraction (AS/SVE) treatment system has been in operation since July 2018.

**Area C:** The 1988-90 study showed groundwater and soil contamination in this area. Area C was the location of a fire training area and fuel tank farm. NAEC and EPA selected an interim remedy – groundwater pumping and treatment – for the area in the site’s February 1991 Record of Decision, or ROD. NAES and EPA selected the final remedy in the site’s 1996 ROD. It called for a continuation of the pump-and-treat system with minor modifications (changing pumping rates and adding pumping wells). Contaminant concentrations have declined over time and the groundwater treatment facility is no longer operating. In 1995, AS/SVE treatmen began at AT016 and TT017, however the SVE portion was shut sown in 2019. Air Sparge continues. Biosparge began in 2018 at AT016 and TT017, but was discontinued at AT016 in 2021., Ground water treatment will continue, until cleanup goals are achieved.

**Area H:** The 1988-90 study showed groundwater and soil contamination in this area. Area H is the location of engine catapult test tracks. NAEC and EPA selected an interim remedy – groundwater pumping and treatment – for the area in the site’s February 1991 ROD. NAEC and EPA selected the final remedy in the site’s 1996 ROD. It called for a continuation of the pump-and-treat system with minor modifications (changing pumping rates and adding pumping wells). Results of the Area H plume stability study reported in 2022 showed that the contaminant of concern concentrations in groundwater continue to decrease or remain stable over time and do not appear to have been influenced by ceasing operation of the groundwater treatment system for the two-year study. The groundwater treatment system is not currently in operation, but groundwater monitoring continues.

**Areas I and J:** The January 1995 Interim ROD included a three-year study to evaluate the potential for in-place biodegradation of a groundwater plume at Areas I and J. Based on the results of the study, a long-term response action would be chosen, either biodegradation or pumping and treating groundwater. NAEC and EPA signed the Final ROD for groundwater cleanup, in September 1999. The selected remedy is natural restoration with long-term groundwater monitoring to address the groundwater contamination in and down-gradient of Areas I and J and co-metabolism to treat the higher area of groundwater contamination. Co-metabolism was found to be ineffective. Another innovative technology, Bimetallic Nanoscale Particle (BNP), was implemented as a pilot study. The pilot study was found to be effective. BNP was expanded throughout Areas I and J in November 2005. Groundwater monitoring continues.

**Area K:** Area K includes soil Sites 4, 5, 8, 27 and 30, and encompasses the receiving ends of the five Recovery Systems Test Sites, or RSTSs. The results of previous investigations and removal actions at Sites 5, 27 and 30 documented the absence of any significant soil contamination posing a threat to human health or the environment. NAEC and EPA signed “No Further Action” RODs for these parts of Area K in September and December 1991. Additional groundwater studies were done in Area K. These studies found a plume of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs), primarily trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene, in the shallow groundwater. The contaminants are attributable to past parts cleaning operations and solvent storage practices at Sites 4 and 8. NAEC and EPA selected the remedy for this groundwater contamination in the site’s July 1997 ROD. It called for limited groundwater pumping to reduce higher levels of contaminants through a sprinkler irrigation system using solar panels (during temperate months) and groundwater monitoring. Groundwater monitoring continues.

**Nine Soil Sites**: The 1988-90 study showed no contamination above state or federal action levels at Sites 15, 18, 23, 26, 27, 30, 34, 40 and Area L. In June 1991, NAEC proposed to take no further action at these sites and Area L. EPA and NAEC signed the ROD for these sites in September 1991.

**Area E, Site 28:** The 1988-90 study and a follow-up study showed groundwater and soil contamination at Site 28. The site contained aboveground and below ground storage tanks. Contaminated soil was removed and taken to a hazardous waste disposal facility. NAEC and EPA selected an interim remedy – groundwater pumping and treatment – for the area in the site’s September 1991 ROD. NAEC and EPA selected the final remedy in the site’s July 1997 ROD. It called for modifications to the ongoing pump-and-treat system and the addition of a vapor extraction/sparging system to enhance remediation in the most contaminated zone.

**Site 29:** A removal action at this old base landfill finished in the summer of 1993. Over 400 rusted-out drums were removed – about 20 of the drums contained liquid or sludge. Based on the results of the removal action, NAEC and EPA signed a ROD in September 1994 calling for no further action at this site.

**Sites 5, 19 and 21:** Based on the 1988-90 study and a follow-up study, significant contamination was found in the soils at these three sites. NAEC conducted removal actions at the sites in 1991. Based on confirmation sampling, no contaminated soils above EPA and state action levels remained following the removal actions. NAEC and EPA signed a ROD in December 1991 calling for no further action at these sites.

**Site 44:** Based on the 1988-90 study and a follow-up study, significant contamination was found in the soil at Site 44. NAEC conducted a removal action in 1991. Based on confirmation sampling, no contaminated soils above EPA and state action levels remained following the removal actions. In August 1991, NAEC proposed no further action at the site. NAEC and EPA signed a ROD in January 1992 calling for no further action at this site.

Multi-site Decisions: Investigation of a second “tier” of sites finished in 1993. In the meantime, several small-scale removal actions were completed. Based on the results of these removal actions and further sampling, NAEC and EPA signed RODs to take no further action at soil Sites 2 and 38, and soil Sites 1, 11 and 35 on June 21, 1993. NAEC and EPA signed the following RODs in September 1993:

**Sites 9, 12, 33, 36, 37, 39, 42:** No further action.

**Site 14:** Treatment of contaminated soil by asphalt batching.  
**Sites 7, 22, 24, 25:** No further action.  
**Sites 3, 6:** Treatment of contaminated soil by asphalt batching.  
**Site 32:** Treatment of contaminated soil by asphalt batching.  
**Site 31:** Groundwater - no action, long-term monitoring.  
**Site 20:** No further action.  
**Site 13:** Treatment of contaminated soil by soil vapor extraction.

**Former Small Arms Ranges:** Soil and groundwater investigations have been completed and the Remedial Investigation (RI) Report for these areas has been reviewed by EPA and NJDEP. The RI Report is expected to become final in 2024.

**Former Parachute Jump Circle Bomb Target and Target Area A:** The Phase I RI Report is dated July 2017 and the Phase II RI Report is dated May 2023. Time critical removal actions were completed during the Summers of 2016 and 2021. Preparation of a Feasibility Study is currently under way.

**Former Submarine Bomb Target:** The public meeting for the Proposed Plan was held on February 17, 2022, with the public comment period ending March 14, 2022. The ROD for the selected remedy became final, with Air Force and EPA signatures in August 2023. The ROD calls for land use controls and the identification and clearance of munitions and explosives of concern, which are planned to begin during the Fall of 2024.

**Emerging Contaminants:** In 2016, two emerging contaminants, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), were confirmed to be present throughout JBMDL-Lakehurst. PFOA and PFOS are components of a type of fire-fighting foam that has been used by the Air Force since 1970 to extinguish petroleum fires. The Air Force replaced existing firefighting foam inventories with recently approved PFOS/PFOA-free alternatives. These two chemicals have been detected off-site as well. If drinking water sources are found to have PFOA or PFOS above 70 parts per trillion (ppt), the Air Force is taking immediate actions to ensure access to clean water. Approximately 130 private wells off-base have been sampled. Design and construction of 2 water mains to connect six properties to the municipal water supply have been completed. Thirty private wells showed detections of PFOA/PFOS less than 70 ppt and are now included in the groundwater monitoring program. Deep drinking water wells on base were non-detect for PFOS and PFOA. However, two shallow back-up drinking water wells exceeded 70 ppt during one of the two sampling events. A deep backup replacement well and treatment building became operational in April 2023. Spring of 2023 began an expanded SI (ESI), to fill data gaps identified in the SI Report and initial ESI sample area. The expanded ESI includes monitoring well installation and collection of soil, groundwater, sediment and surface water samples off-base. The Air Force is conducting a base-wide remedial investigation to determine the nature and extent of contamination due to firefighting foam.  
  
**Five Year Reviews:** NAEC/JBMDL-Lakehurst and EPA have conducted several five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The reviews concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedies selected by NAEC and EPA and that the remedies continue to be protective of human health and the environment. The last five-year review was completed in September 2021. The next five-year review will be completed by September 2026.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site has been addressed by focusing on the most contaminated areas first. The Navy studied soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment contamination at 42 soil sites and groundwater areas from 1988 to 1990. Based on the investigation, remedial actions were proposed for several soil sites and groundwater areas. Because of data gaps at some areas, a supplemental investigation started in 1991. The Navy submitted a report and risk assessment to EPA in May 1992. The information in the supplemental report and preceding reports is the basis for making environmental cleanup decisions for the remaining site areas.

Groundwater treatment and monitoring are ongoing.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The groundwater remedies at Area A&B, Area C, Area H and Area I/J of JBMDL-Lakehurst include ongoing sampling for volatile organic compounds, metals, treatment system results and monitored natural attenuation parameters.
