### Background

The 6-acre Sonford Products Superfund Site is in Flowood, Mississippi. The site consists of the former Sonford Products parcel, an undeveloped parcel to the south referred to as the Wixson parcel, and the contaminated groundwater plume. It is bordered by railroad tracks to the west, a residential area further west, and wooded areas on the north, south, and east.

From 1972 to 1985, Sonford International and Sonford Products operated two separate chemical manufacturing plants at the site. The operations of both companies involved turning solid pentachlorophenol (PCP) into liquid formulations. Facility operations released dioxin, PCP, pesticides, and metals to the air, soil, groundwater, surface water, and sediment. In 1983, a reactor containing site contaminants caught fire and a vapor cloud from the burning chemicals migrated over the adjacent residential properties. In 1985, a 2,000-gallon spill occurred at the site and chemical manufacturing operations ended after receipt of a cease-and-desist order from the town of Flowood. The current owner manufactures concrete septic tanks on the property.

In 2007, the EPA placed the site on the Superfund program's [National Priorities List](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-national-priorities-list-npl) (NPL) because of contaminated soil, sediment, surface water and groundwater resulting from facility operations.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The EPA and the Mississippi Department of Natural Resources \[now [Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality](https://www.mdeq.ms.gov/) (MDEQ)\] have made strides towards reducing risks caused by site contamination through the following actions:

**1985**

- Removed about 2,500 cubic yards of contaminated soil and disposed of it at an off-site facility
- Treated and disposed of about 10,000 gallons of contaminated oil and 100,000 gallons of waste water

**2009**

The EPA selected the long-term cleanup plan for OU-1 in the Site's Record of Decision (ROD) to address subsurface soil deeper than 1-foot and groundwater. It included:

- Extraction of non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL)
- Application of chemical oxidant-based product using a technology called in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) to encourage the breakdown of contamination in on-site subsurface soil, residual NAPL/source area zones, and groundwater
- Treatment of off-site shallow groundwater using in-situ enhanced bioremediation (ISEB)
- Adding additional groundwater monitoring wells to monitor the groundwater plume
- Monitoring groundwater to assess the progress of contamination reduction
- Implementing Institutional Controls (ICs) to limit soil disturbance on portions of the site property and to ensure groundwater from the contaminated aquifer is not used for drinking water.

**2010**

The EPA selected the long-term cleanup plan for OU-2 in the Site's 2010 ROD to address contaminated surface soil (surface to 1-foot below ground), surface water, and sediment. It included:

- Excavation of woodland/wetland sediment to the south of the former facility, off-site drainage ditch sediment, and sub-parcels of off-site residential surface soil.
- Transportation of excavated soil and sediment back on site to be consolidated and capped in a containment cell.
- Backfilling of excavated areas with clean material.
- Covering of all contaminated soil and sediment on site with a barrier to prevent migration of contaminants into subsurface soils.
- Monitoring of surface water to ensure contaminants are naturally degrading over time and will achieve protective levels.
- Implementation of ICs such as an environmental covenant to restrict surface soil disturbance and on-site construction activity without appropriate authorization as well as land use restrictions.
- Engineering controls during remedial activities that may include soil grading, dust suppression, and stormwater controls.

**2012 - 2014**

The EPA began OU-2 remedial activities including:

- Removal of an abandoned on-site residential structure.
- Excavated contaminated soils from 8 residential properties in the Payne Drive neighborhood with elevated dioxin levels. The properties were then restored with sod and replacement of trees, bushes, and fencing where necessary.
- Excavated sediment and surface soil from the off-site drainage ditch between the Sonford Products Parcel and the Payne Drive neighborhood.
- Stockpiled contaminated soils and sediment on sit, covered and contained within a liner, and installed a chain-link fence around the stockpile area.

**2015**

The EPA completed Multiphase Extraction NAPL recovery in the source area of the site and removed 11,290 gallons of NAPL from the groundwater.

**2017**

The EPA issued an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) to record significant changes to the OU-1 and OU-2 RODs. These changes included:

- Updates to the site layout map and facility address.
- Increases in remedial action cost due to the extended period of NAPL recovery and the volume of NAPL extracted.
- Extend the operating term limit for the temporary stockpiled soil and sediment described in the OU-2 ROD
**2020**

The EPA removed 1,405 gallons of NAPL from the groundwater using extraction and vent wells in the source area. Data measurements suggested that the majority of NAPL had been removed and presented favorable conditions for ISCO activities to begin.

**2022**

The EPA completed the following activities under OU-1:

- Transportation of the stockpiled soil and sediment to offsite disposal facilities
- An ISCO pilot study in the contaminant source area to determine the effectiveness of a chemical oxidant (sodium persulfate) to treat PCP-impacted soils.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA completed the second [Five-Year Review (FYR) f](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11189898) or the site in 2023.

The EPA and MDEQ continue to work together to clean up the site. Sometimes the EPA divides sites into [operable units](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#o) (OUs). This site has the following OUs:
- OU00 – Sitewide
- OU01 – Contaminated groundwater and subsurface soil
- OU02 – Contaminated surface soil, sediment and surface water

The EPA is planning to begin the full scale in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) remedy in the source area in early 2025. This will also include groundwater monitoring. Residents with monitoring wells on their property will be contacted individually.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The EPA is working to set formal limitations in place to prevent the use of contaminated groundwater as drinking water and implement land use restrictions at the former Sonford Products property. However, all residents near the site are connected to municipal water services and do not have access to site contaminated groundwater.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The EPA will be conducting a groundwater sampling event in January 2025 to include offsite monitoring wells. Residents with wells located on their property will be contacted individually. Once the ISCO mixing activites begin, soil samples will be collected to monitor the remedy progress in the source area. Residents may notice an increase in noise and traffic during these times.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, the EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA was unsuccessful in negotiating financial obligations with any viable [Potentially Responsible Party](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) (PRP). Cleanup activities at this site are “Fund Lead,”meaning they are paid through taxpayer funding.
