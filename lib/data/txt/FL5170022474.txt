### Background

The [Naval Air Station (NAS) Cecil Field](https://www.navfac.navy.mil/products_and_services/ev/products_and_services/env_restoration/installation_map/navfac_atlantic/southeast/nas_cecil_field.html) site is located in northeastern Florida. It is mainly located in Duval County and its southernmost part is in Clay County. The former base takes up about 17,200 acres.

The official mission of NAS Cecil Field was to provide services for the operation and maintenance of naval weapons, aircrafts and other units of the operating forces. The tasks required to accomplish this mission included operation of fuel storage facilities, aircraft maintenance, maintenance and operation of an engine repair facility and test cells for designated turbojet engines. Naval base operations contaminated the soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals.

The [Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP)](https://floridadep.gov/), EPA and the Department of the Navy signed a Federal Facilities Agreement for NAS Cecil Field in 1990. The agreement ensures that that appropriate cleanup and corrective actions are developed and implemented to protect the public health, welfare and the environment.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Department of the Navy is leading site cleanup activities and the EPA provides oversight.

EPA identified 12 [Operable Units (OUs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#O). These OUs refer to different parts of the site. OU-1, for example, refers to the Old Landfill and an area referred to as the Recent Landfill. EPA has issued for all 12 OUs. These RODs describe the cleanup approaches for the various portions of the site.

EPA finalized the fourth Five-Year Review in the fall of 2016. The review found that remedial actions at Operable Unit (OU) 2 (Site 5) and OU-7 (Site 16) are protective in the short term, but further actions are required to evaluate long-term protectiveness. The remedies at OU-1, OU-2 (Site 17), OU-5, OU-8, OU-10, OU-9, OU-11, and OU-12 are protective. The remedies at OU-3, OU-4, OU- 6 and OU-7 have Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA). MNA is an in situ remediation technology where naturally occurring physical, chemical, and biological processes sufficiently attenuate contaminant concentrations in soil and groundwater to protect human health and the environment and achieve remedial goals within a reasonable timeframe.

#### Operable Units Protectiveness Classification Table (2016 FYR)

| **OU** | **Location** | **Site Name** | **Protectiveness Classification** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OU-1 | Landfills | Sites 1&2 | Protective |
| OU-2 | Site 5 | Oil Disposal Area | Short Term |
| OU-3 | Site 7 & 8 | Old Fire Training Area | Monitored Natural Attenuation |
| OU-4 | Site 10 | Rubble Disposal Area | \*RA Complete No Further Action |
| OU-5 | Site 15 | Blue 10 Ordnance Disposal | Protective |
| OU-6 | Site 11 | Pesticide Disposal Area | Monitored Natural Attenuation |
| OU-7 | Site 16 | AIMD Seepage Pit | Monitored Natural Attenuation |
| OU-8 | Site 3 | Oil/Sludge Disposal Pit | Protective |
| OU-9 | FlghtLine | G W Plumes 36, 37, 58, 57 | Protective |
| OU-10 | Sites 21 & 25 | Pest Mix Area | Protective |
| OU-11 | Site 45 | Old Steam Plant | Protective |
| OU-12 | Site 32 | DRMO Asphalt Storage Yard | Protective |

The Navy performed offsite and onsite sampling in 2018 for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and found that none of the private wells sampled exceeded the EPA heath advisory level (HAL). Data showed that there are areas on-site with PFAS concentrations that exceed the HAL.

\*RA = Remedial Action

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA identified 12 [Operable Units (OUs)](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#o). These OUs refer to different parts of the site. OU-1, for example, refers to the Old Landfill and an area referred to as the Recent Landfill. EPA has issued for all 12 OUs. These RODs describe the cleanup approaches for the various portions of the site.

Currently, all sites that are not closed, with no further action, remain under monitored natural attenuation and Land Use Controls (LUCs); Site 3 continues with active air sparging.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

[Land Use Controls](http://www.epa.gov/fedfac/land-use-controls-lucs) are placed on sites that remains under [Monitored Natural Attenuation](http://clu-in.org/download/Citizens/a_citizens_guide_to_monitored_natural_attenuation.pdf) for industrial and recreational use.

### Green Remediation

The Navy is using solar power generated electricity for the [air sparging](https://clu-in.org/download/Citizens/a_citizens_guide_to_soil_vapor_extraction_and_air_sparging.pdf) system at Site 3 to clean up [vinyl chloride](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=281&tid=51) in the groundwater plume that is migrating toward the creek.
