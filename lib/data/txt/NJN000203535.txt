Background
Since 2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been investigating residential properties in the East Trenton neighborhood in Trenton, New Jersey to find out if lead contamination in the soil is coming from former pottery manufacturers. The EPA sampled properties to determine if the soil in community members’ yards is contaminated with lead from the historic pottery facilities. The results of the EPA’s investigation showed significant lead contamination in the soil at residential properties, public schools, and parks in East Trenton. The pottery manufacturers operated for over 100 years in East Trenton starting in the 1850s. These pottery manufacturers used lead in their glazes. According to historic resources, an estimated 80 locations existed throughout the City of Trenton where pottery manufacturing occurred and about 30 of those were located in East Trenton and Top Road. The waste and pollution from the pottery manufacturing left soil in East Trenton contaminated with lead. The Historic Potteries site includes residential properties, public parks, and public schools in and around the East Trenton neighborhood in the City of Trenton, Mercer County, New Jersey. The State of New Jersey referred the site to the EPA and supports placing this site on the National Priorities List, or NPL. The EPA has proposed the Historic Potteries site for the NPL based on the results of an extensive investigation that began in 2018. This means that the site is eligible for federal funding to pay for extensive, long-term cleanup actions under the EPA’s Superfund program. The EPA follows a formal process for assessing hazardous waste sites and placing them on the NPL. The EPA will examine the nature and extent of contamination and options for addressing the contamination by conducting a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study. If the site is added to the NPL, the EPA will then propose cleanup methods, identify a cleanup plan, and clean up the site. The community will be involved throughout this process. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The EPA began investigating a former solder manufacturer in East Trenton in 2018 and found high lead levels on nearby residential properties. However, the EPA determined that the lead contamination was not caused by the solder manufacturer. In 2020, the EPA performed extensive research to determine whether the historic pottery industry caused lead contamination in the soil. The EPA began sampling residential properties, schools, and parks within the Top Road and East Trenton neighborhoods in 2023. After finding elevated levels of lead throughout the soil in East Trenton, the EPA proposed to add the site to the National Priorities List, or NPL, on September 4, 2024. After discovering lead contamination at Ulysses S. Grant Intermediate School, the EPA worked closely with Trenton Public School District officials and teachers to create a plan that would protect students and teachers from lead contamination and give students safe areas to play and learn outside again. The EPA installed artificial turf, soil and sod, and mulch to the exposed soil at the school to provide a temporary barrier from the lead contamination. The EPA installed clean soil and mulch at Sonny Vereen and Breunig Avenue Parks located in East Trenton, in order to provide a temporary barrier to the lead contamination, making these parks accessible to the community again and safe for children to play. The EPA has begun to install protective covers at high-risk residences where children or pregnant women live. The EPA has also begun installing raised garden beds for residents that regularly garden.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The EPA proposed adding the Historic Potteries site to the National Priorities List on September 4, 2024. The EPA is currently reviewing the public comments received on the proposal and is in the process of determining if the site will be listed. However, the EPA is currently taking actions at high-risk residential properties to ensure that residents are protected from the lead contamination. Top of Page
Emergency Response and Removal
The EPA is taking actions in the short term to address soil contamination at properties where children under the age of seven, pregnant women, or gardeners use their yard. The EPA installed temporary soil covers at Sonny Vereen and Breunig Avenue Parks to protect community members visiting the parks from lead contamination found in the soil. The EPA has addressed lead contamination in soil at Ulysses S. Grant Intermediate School by installing temporary soil covers so that students may safely return to learn and play. The EPA has been installing temporary soil covers at high-risk properties occupied by children or pregnant women and installing raised garden beds at residential properties where residents regularly garden.
