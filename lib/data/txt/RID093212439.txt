### Background

The Landfill and Resource Recovery, Inc. (L&RR) site is a 28-acre landfill on a 36-acre parcel of land in North Smithfield, Rhode Island. The site originally was a sand and gravel pit and was used for small-scale refuse disposal from 1927 to 1974. In 1974, the site was sold and developed into a large-scale disposal facility accepting commercial, municipal, and industrial wastes. An estimated one million gallons of hazardous wastes were accepted and disposed of with other wastes in the center of the landfill. The hazardous wastes included many types of bulk and drummed organic and inorganic materials in liquid, sludge, and solid forms. In 1979, the operator put a polyvinyl chloride cover over the area containing hazardous waste to prevent rainwater from entering. Landfilling of commercial and residential wastes continued until 1985, when the owners closed the landfill and placed another synthetic cover over most of the landfill. Soil was placed over the synthetic cover, and it was partially planted with vegetation. Facility operations contaminated air, surface water, and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities, and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. In 1977, the owner installed monitoring wells on site to ensure compliance with state regulations. In 1985, the landfill closed. At that time, 75 percent of the site was covered with a synthetic cap to minimize infiltration of rain and melted snow. Soil was also used as a vegetative cover. The cap was built with gas vents to prevent the build-up of gases. The selected long-term remedy, as documented in a 1988 Record of Decision, included installation of substantial fencing; stabilization of the steep side slopes of the landfill and installation of a synthetic cap over the uncapped area of the landfill, with establishment of a vegetative cover over the landfill; collection and thermal destruction of underlying gases in an enclosed flare; and groundwater and air monitoring. In 1995, the site’s PRPs finished putting these cleanup actions in place.

EPA has conducted [several five-year reviews](http://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0101265&doc=Y&colid=32853&requestTimeout=480) of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The [most recent review](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/565428) concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. EPA also concluded that additional groundwater, surface water and sediment investigations are required downgradient from the landfill.

The review also concluded that the flare and gas collection system should be tested to confirm they comply with performance standards. The enclosed flare was restarted in 2009, and is operating intermittently. Periodic monitoring of the gas collection and treatment system along with the groundwater monitoring well network is ongoing. EPA, the state and the site’s PRPs have established land and groundwater use restrictions at the site. Closing the landfill, installing a cover, stabilizing steep side slopes, destroying underlying gases, and building a fence to limit access to the landfill have reduced the potential for exposure to hazardous materials at the site while operation and maintenance activities continue.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included landfill capping and use of an enclosed flare to thermally treat landfill gases. The work took place in the summer of 1995. Since then, the site’s potentially responsible parties (PRPs) have been operating and maintaining the remedy as well as monitoring to ensure the remedy remains protective.

Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring for Operable Unit 1 are ongoing. In 2016, EPA began investigation activities for Operable Unit 2 to address a groundwater plume found at the site, which includes 1,4-dioxane and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). In 2021, EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) setting forth a remedy for Operable Unit 2. The selected remedy utilizes in-situ (below ground) treatment and sequestration and institutional controls to prevent the migration of the contaminants of concern from Operable Unit 2 and to restore groundwater outside of the waste management area to its beneficial use as a source of drinking water. Remedial design for Operable Unit 2 is ongoing, and construction is expected to begin in 2026.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**

This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.  
  
The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
