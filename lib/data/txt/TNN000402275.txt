### Background

The.62-acre Former Custom Cleaners (FCC) [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located at 3517 Southern Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee. The site is bordered to the north by Southern Avenue, to the east by Minor Road, to the south by Spotswood Avenue and to the west by South Highland Avenue.

A dry cleaner operated on site from 1945 until the mid-1990s. Custom Cleaners began operating at the property in 1974. Its operations ceased in the mid-1990s. A discount art supply company operated on site from 1999 to 2014.

EPA placed the FCC site was added to the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) August 3, 2017 because of soil, indoor air and groundwater contamination resulting from facility operations. Site investigations by EPA and the [Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC)](https://www.tn.gov/environment/about-tdec.html) are ongoing. Through these efforts, EPA and TDEC will protect people and the environment from site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA is leading ongoing soil and groundwater site investigation activities in cooperation with the Tennesse Department of Environment & Conservation (TDEC).

**2013 - 2015**  
In June 2013, TDEC received a complaint from an FCC tenant. The tenant complained of strong odors in the building.

TDEC conducted soil and indoor air sampling in 2013 and conducted a follow-up site inspection in March 2015. Based on findings from these activities, TDEC referred the site to EPA for cleanup enforcement under CERCLA.

**2016 - 2018**  
In September 2016, EPA proposed the site for listing on the NPL and it became final on August 3, 2017.

The EPA split the Site into two Operable Units (OUs); OU-1 addresses the Site-related soil contamination, while OU-2 addresses the Site-related groundwater contamination.

The EPA conducted the OU-1 RI/FS in 2017 and in 2018 which focused on fully characterizing the highest levels of PCE remaining in the soil and soil gas after EPA’s removal action.

The EPA signed the Interim Action OU-1 Record of Decision (ROD) in September 2018, which includes In-Situ Thermal Desorption (ISTD) and Soil Vapor Extraction (SVE) as the two treatment technologies to address the PCE contamination in the soil and soil gas.

**2019 - 2021**  
In September 2019, the EPA finalized the OU-1 Remedial Design (RD).

The EPA continues to conduct the OU-2 RI/FS to investigate the nature and extend of Site-related groundwater contamination. Fifteen groundwater monitoring wells have been installed on-Site; three wells installed during July 2019 three wells installed during April 2020, four wells installed during March 2021, and five wells installed during August 2021.

EPA Region 4 intends to use funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to implement the soil clean up selected in the 2018 Interim Action OU-1 Record of Decision (ROD).

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The EPA signed the [Interim Action OU-1 Record of Decision (ROD)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11111981) in September 2018, which includes In-Situ Thermal Desorption (ISTD) and Soil Vapor Extraction (SVE) as the two treatment technologies to address the PCE contamination in the soil and soil gas.

The Former Custom Cleaners Superfund Site has been designated Human Exposure Under Control.

There are currently no unacceptable human exposure pathways and EPA has determined the site is under control for human exposure.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA was unsuccessful in locating and negotiating financial obligations with any viable PRPs. Cleanup activities at this site are “Fund Lead,” paid through taxpayer funding.
