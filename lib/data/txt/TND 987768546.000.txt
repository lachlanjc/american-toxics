### Background

The 5-acre Chemet Company site is located in Moscow, Tennessee. The site includes the area where an antimony oxide facility operated from 1978 to 1987. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1994 because of contaminated soil and debris resulting from facility operations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Tennessee Department of Health and Environment (TDHE, now the Department of Environment and Conservation, or TDEC) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. By cleaning up the site, EPA and TDEC continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The 5-acre area is located on Highway 57, about one mile east of Moscow in Fayette County, Tennessee. The site includes three buildings and two ponds. Industrial land uses border the site to the north and west. A playground at LaGrange-Moscow Elementary School borders the site to the east. Highway 57 borders the site to the south. Site surroundings include rural and agricultural land.

From 1978 to 1987, Chemet Company operated an antimony oxide facility at the site. Operations included processing of lead-laden ore into antimony, a fire retardant and plastics strengthener. Operations stored wastes from the furnaces in unsecured stockpiles, bins, containers and barrels on site before disposing of the waste. Fencing surrounds the site and areas of off-site contamination to prevent people from coming into contact with contamination.

- TDEC visited the site in 1983 and 1989 and found waste containing drums, two 15-gallon waste drums and several bags of soda ash. TDEC also found trespassers could easily access the site. In 1990, TDEC secured the facility with a fence and removed about 300 tons of contaminated soil from an area north of Building No. 3. TDEC stored and locked the soil in Building No. 2. In 1992, Chemet Company constructed a fence around areas of off-site contamination to prevent students and workers at the elementary school next to the site from coming in contact with contaminated soil.
- In 1994, EPA listed the site on the NPL. EPA led site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with TDEC.
- Site cleanup activities under SACM took place in 1994 and 1995. Activities included digging up, segregating and categorizing contaminated soil on site and at the LaGrange-Moscow Elementary School ball field. EPA dug up soil to a minimum depth of 6 inches across the site. EPA disposed of over 20,000 tons of non-hazardous contaminated soil at the South Shelby Landfill in Memphis and an additional 600 tons of contaminated soil off site. EPA disposed of over 120 drums of slag and 37 boxes of raw ore off site. EPA demolished, pressure washed and removed buildings from the site and closed an on-site private well. After digging up contaminated soil, EPA covered the site with a 6-inch layer of clean soil, reseeded the site with grass and repaired damaged sections of the site’s fence.
- Following cleanup activities, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1996.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Based on site investigation activities, EPA determined the site to be a candidate for cleanup under Superfund Accelerated Cleanup Model (SACM) guidelines. EPA designed SACM as a way to speed up cleanups and increase the efficiency of the Superfund process. Sampling surveys confirmed the site’s soil contamination. EPA determined that short-term cleanup activities under SACM would accomplish cleanup goals. The long-term remedy for the site, selected in 1996, included EPA’s decision that there is no need for further action.

Following completion of cleanup activities in 1996, EPA took the site off the NPL. EPA does not require additional monitoring of the site or Five-Year Reviews.
