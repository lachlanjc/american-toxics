### Background

The 30-acre Frit Industries site is located in Walnut Ridge, Arkansas. Since the early 1950s, Frit Industries has manufactured micronutrients and trace element additives for fertilizer on site. In 1979, a fire destroyed portions of the facility, resulting in the release of 81,000 gallons of water contaminated with heavy metals. The contaminated water caused a fish kill in nearby Coon Creek. Site activities, in conjunction with waste disposal practices and the 1979 release, contaminated soil, surface water and groundwater with heavy metals. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1997.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through PRP and state actions.

Frit Industries is located on what was once a U.S. Army Air Corps training base during World War II, and has been the site of an active fertilizer production facility since the early 1950s. The site has been contaminated with piles of raw material, product and waste material from the facility’s fertilizer micronutrient process, which were – in the past – stored directly on the ground surface without a liner or a cover. The most notable contamination as a result of the piles is from surface water runoff at the site. The facility is located in an inter-stream area of the White River watershed, between Coon Creek and Village Creek. Surface runoff from the facility drains directly into an unnamed stream that discharges into Coon Creek. The creek is a tributary of Village Creek, which discharges into the White River.  
  
Since the 1980s, Frit Industries has been inspected regularly and monitored by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ).Frit Industries is located on what was once a U.S. Army Air Corps training base during World War II, and has been the site of an active fertilizer production facility since the early 1950s.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Cleanup activities by the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP) between 1982 and 1985 included removal of about 100 tons of contaminated surface soil, construction of a surface water collection and treatment system, and biological sampling of Coon Creek.  
  
The PRP signed a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) administrative order on consent in 1987 to develop closure plans for two hazardous waste storage facilities and a surge pond, and a groundwater evaluation and monitoring plan. The site’s cleanup authority has been transferred from EPA to Arkansas RCRA and Superfund programs. The state will oversee any additional cleanup activities.  
  
In 2009, a deed restriction was placed on the site property restricting groundwater use. Ongoing operation and maintenance activities include routine groundwater monitoring and annual inspections.  
  
EPA placed the site in the site on the NPL in 1983 and later took the site off the NPL in 1997.
