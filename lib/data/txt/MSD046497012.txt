Background
The 30-acre Davis Timber Company Superfund site is located in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. From 1972 until the late 1980s, Davis Timber Company operated a wood-preserving facility at the site. Site operators discharged contaminated wastewater into an on-site storage pond, contaminating soil and sediment. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2000 because of contaminated groundwater, soil and sediment resulting from facility operations. EPA and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) have investigated site conditions. Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site. By cleaning up the site, EPA and MDEQ continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
2011 - 2012
Cleanup began during October 2011 following receipt of remedial action funding through the President’s Jobs Initiative Program. Construction activities finished in September 2012, and included 
site clearing and demolition of on-site structures
installation of the impoundment liquid extraction and treatment system. This system treated about 525,000 gallons of liquid.
relocation of about 1,046 linear feet of West Mineral Creek
construction of berm impoundment
excavation of about 2,500 cubic yards of contaminated soil from the cooling pond and areas of surface soil contamination
construction of an impoundment cap
final grading and vegetation.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The second Five Year Review was published by EPA HQs in 2021. The remedy at OU1 currently protects human health and the environment because there are no completed exposure pathways; contaminated soil and sediment were excavated and capped, and impoundment water was treated and discharged. EPA has implement institutional controls, including land use restrictions and deed notices, for the capped area and the site property to limit future land uses. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Green Remediation
Construction of the site’s remedy incorporated a number of green remediation measures through reuse, repurposing and recycling of materials and onboard design optimization measures. Green remediation measures included recycling of steel recovered during demolition of site structures, repurposing clean concrete slab material into 3,000 cubic yards of riprap for erosion protection in the realigned reach of West Mineral Creek, reuse of trees and shrubs collected from site clearing and grubbing for 2,000 cubic yards of mulch, optimization of the reseeding design to incorporate drought tolerant indigenous species and soil amendments  reducing the watering requirement by 30 to 35 percent, and reuse of treated impoundment water for irrigation of reseeded areas.

Enforcement Information
Enforcing environmental laws is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.
The EPA has been unable to identify any viable potentially responsible parties for the site. The EPA is using federal funds for site cleanup activities.
