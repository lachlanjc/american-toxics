### Background

The US Finishing/Cone Mills [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) Site is located in Greenville, South Carolina. It includes an area used for various manufacturing operations from 1903 to 2003.

The EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 2011 because of contaminated surface water, groundwater and sediment resulting from facility operations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the [South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC)](https://www.scdhec.gov/) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the Site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination.

In order to facilitate the investigation of different areas of concern (AOC), the Site was divided into three Operable Units (OU), based on the historic operations: OU1 – Main Facility; OU2 – Off Main Facility; OU3 – Sitewide Groundwater.

The EPA selected this Site as an Integrated Cleanup Initiative pilot project to demonstrate an innovative combination of management approaches and cleanup techniques.

The public water system provides water supplies to nearby residents and businesses. To the Agency's knowledge, contaminated groundwater has not affected drinking water supplies.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

| When | What |
| --- | --- |
| **19** **80s -**  **2003** | SCDHEC has overseen several facility closure activities, including installation of a groundwater pump-and-treat system. The system operated from 1982 to 2003, when the facility burned down and the facility owner declared bankruptcy. |
| **2012** | The EPA completed a short-term cleanup action to demolish facility buildings and secure the Site in April 2012.  The EPA conducted an extensive investigation, to fully assess site-related threats to people living near the site and the environment and to evaluate cleanup options. |
| **2021** | The EPA invited the public to comment on the proposed cleanup plan for the USFCM site for Operable Unit 2: Off Main-Facility (OU2). The OU2 Proposed Plan [fact sheet](http://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11145192.pdf) summarized the Proposed Plan. Additional information on the OU2 Proposed Plan and related site information can be found in the Administrative Record.  To assist the community in understanding the plan, the EPA also prepared a [prerecorded video](http://youtu.be/gQU_tripKC0) that explains the OU2 Proposed Plan. It details the preferred alternative of No Further Action for OU2. The outlying areas off the main facility property pose no current or potential threat to human health or the environment based on collected data under anticipated future land uses (residential, commercial, industrial, or recreational). Comments and questions are addressed in the Responsiveness Summary in the [Record of Decision](http://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11159855.pdf). **The EPA received no adverse comments.** |
| **March 2022** | The EPA invited the public to comment on the proposed cleanup plan for the USFCM site for Operable Unit 1 (OU1). The OU1 Proposed Plan [fact sheet](http://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11137752.pdf) summarized the Proposed Plan. Additional information on the Proposed Plan and related site information can be found in the Administrative Record.  To assist the community in understanding the plan, EPA also prepared a [prerecorded video](http://youtu.be/myoPNISD72k) that explains the OU1 Proposed Plan. The proposed remedy will address potential risks to human health and the environment from contaminated soil and asbestos-containing material in multiple areas of concern (AOCs) for OU1: Main Facility. Multiple AOCs for OU1: Main Facility pose no current or potential threat to human health or the environment based on collected data under anticipated future land uses (residential, commercial, industrial, or recreational).  **The EPA received no adverse comments.** |
| **August 2022** | The EPA announced the partial deletion from the National Priorities List (NPL) for Operable Unit 1 (OU1) of the Site. The EPA and the SCDHEC determined that remedial actions conducted at the Site have been protective of public health, welfare, and the environment. However, this deletion does not preclude future actions under Superfund.  Please visit the [Federal Register](http://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/17/2022-17479/proposed-deletion-from-the-national-priorities-list) to view the partial deletion notice. |
| **July 2023** | The EPA held a public meeting and invited the public to comment on the EPA [Proposed Plan](http://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11164929.pdf) for a portion of the USFCM Site. This [fact sheet](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11164887) summarizes the preferred remedy to treat groundwater in the surficial aquifer using in-situ chemical reduction and in-situ enhanced bioremediation. The EPA also proposed requiring institutional controls to prohibit groundwater use within the contaminated groundwater plume. The Operable Unit 3 (OU3) Sitewide Groundwater plume is located beneath the former facility and includes any portion that has moved off the facility. The contaminants of concern for OU3 include metals, SVOCs and VOCs. The [Proposed Plan](http://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11164929.pdf) presents EPA’s preferred remedy for the cleanup of OU3. |
| **Septemeber 2023** | The final [Record of Decision (ROD) for OU3](http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11189809) was signed September 28, 2023. |
| **Septemebr 2024** | The Remedial Design to implement the Remdial Action for OU3: Sitewide Groundwater was approved. The State of South Carolina is implementing the Remedial Action for OU3 utilizing funds provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. |

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The majority of the Site has been deleted from the National Priorities list. Cleanup work remains to be conducted on the Main Facility area and groundwater. The remedial design to implement the cleanup for groundwater has been approved and the State of South Carolina is conducting the work on behalf of the EPA.
