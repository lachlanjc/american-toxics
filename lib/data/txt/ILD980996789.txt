### Background

The Ilada Energy Company site is a 17-acre abandoned tank farm southeast of East Cape Girardeau in Alexander County, Illinois. It formerly had a tank storage capacity of 12 million gallons. In the 1980s, the site was found to contain oil, sludge and contaminated water, some of which contained a variety of hazardous and toxic substances, including toxic heavy metals, industrial solvents and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in January 2001.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

**August 2024**

EPA has completed a status review of the site's cleanup. This type of review is required at least every five years where the cleanup is complete but hazardous waste remains managed on-site. These reviews are done to ensure that the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This was the fifth five-year review. The review included:  
• An evaluation of background information  
• Cleanup requirements  
• Effectiveness of the cleanup and any anticipated future actions  
• An analysis of ways for EPA to operate more efficiently  
• Maintenance and monitoring efforts

EPA finalized and approved the fifth Five Year Review (FYR) Report for the site in August 2024. The FYR determined that the remedy at the site is protective of human health and the environment. In order ensure that the remedy to be protective in the long-term, the FYR report recommends that a long-term stewardship plan including groundwater monitoring procedures should be prepared and implemented.
