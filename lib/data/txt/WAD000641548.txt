### Background

The 50-acre North Market Street site is located in Spokane, Washington. The Phillips Petroleum Company, Tosco Refining Company and Chevron operated a petroleum refining and distribution complex at the site beginning in the 1980s. Site operations, discharge of hazardous liquid wastes to unlined waste ponds, and major oil spill incidents contaminated on-site soil and groundwater with petroleum and chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

The North Market Street Site is in an industrial area 1.5 miles north of Spokane, Spokane County, Washington. The site was originally proposed under the name "Tosco Corp. (Spokane Terminal)." Investigations subsequent to the proposal indicate that Tosco may not be the primary source of problems at the site. In 1976, Tosco purchased a 50-acre portion of the site, which it now uses as a bulk storage tank farm for petroleum products. An oil refinery had previously been on the property. According to information Tosco provided to EPA, as required by Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) Section 103(c), lead-containing wastes listed as hazardous under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act were disposed of on the ground and in holes, probably before 1970. The site overlies the Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer, which EPA has designated as a sole source of drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Soil in an old waste oil lagoon in the northwest corner of the site contains high levels of lead, according to Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) tests conducted in 1986. (A small part of the lagoon is on Tosco property.) The soil overlying the aquifer is highly permeable, which facilitates movement of contaminants into ground water. Wells within 3 miles of the site provide drinking water to over 200,000 people and are also used for irrigating croplands. The Tosco Refining Company and Phillips Petroleum Company were the potentially liable parties (PLPs) responsible for site cleanup. The two companies merged during the cleanup action. Since the Tosco/Phillips merger, Phillips and Conoco merged creating the Conoco Phillips Company, now responsible for operation, maintenance and monitoring of the ongoing soil and groundwater cleanup under State oversight. Under a 1992 State Order, the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) completed the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) in August 1998. A Cleanup Action Plan was completed on December 14, 1999. The cleanup action consisted of shallow soil removal and on-site thermal treatment, installation and operation of an air sparging groundwater treatment system, and installation and operation of a vadose zone bioventing system. This was designated "construction complete" in December 2002.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The siteâ€™s long-term remedy included soil excavation and treatment; soil vapor venting; institutional controls; and air sparging and natural attenuation of groundwater contaminants. Remedy construction took place between 2001 and 2002. Site monitoring is ongoing.
