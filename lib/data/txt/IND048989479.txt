### Background

The 35-acre Wayne Waste Oil site is located in Columbia City, Indiana. Wayne Waste Oil, a division of Wayne Reclamation and Recycling, Inc., deposited about one million gallons of oil-related wastes on site from 1975 to 1980. The site contained leaking drums, waste areas covered with sands, and disposal ponds. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires ongoing operation and maintenance activities and putting enhanced institutional controls in place.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site remedy is in place. The Site remedy components have been implemented including the treatment systems, slurry wall, landfill cap, ICs, and O&M program. Remedy construction took place from 1994 to 1995. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. The five year review in January 2019 concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Another site five-year-review is in progress and scheduled to be completed in 2024.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Municipal waste materials from Columbia City are deposited in the Site landfill. Other Site contaminants of concern for soil and groundwater are predominantly volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions in 1986 and 1988 disposed of drums, liquids, sludges, contaminated soil and the contents of storage tanks.
