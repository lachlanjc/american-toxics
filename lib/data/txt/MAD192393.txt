### Background

The Silresim Chemical Corp. site is located at 86 Tanner Street in Lowell, Massachusetts. The site consists of the 4.5-acre Silresim property and soil and groundwater contamination that extends to other nearby properties. Starting in 1971, Silresim began reclaiming a variety of chemical wastes, waste oil, solvents and sludges containing heavy metals on site. In 1977, Silresim declared bankruptcy and abandoned the property, leaving behind 30,000 decaying drums and several large storage tanks. The state began to clean up the Site in 1978. Following construction of the site’s long-term remedy, groundwater treatment, operations and maintenance activities, and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

EPA has conducted several FiveYear Reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The 2014 Five Year Review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Initial actions to fence the site and cap or cover areas of contamination reduced the potential for accidental exposure and the further migration of contamination from the site. The interim cap was further improved during construction of the groundwater treatment facility and the site has been secured since construction activity began in mid-1994. These actions have eliminated the immediate threats posed by the site while final cleanup activities are underway. The site’s final remedy for source areas – thermally enhanced soil vapor extraction – was completed in 2012. The site’s groundwater treatment facility has been operating since November 1995. Remaining site restoration activities (fence removal, top soil placement, drainage improvements) were completed in 2013.

Groundwater treatment, operations and maintenance activities, and monitoring are ongoing.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**  
  
This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The matrix below is a general summary of the restrictions at this site at the date of this report. The information in this matrix is a general description of the restrictions at the site only. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.  
  
The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above. Note that where multiple entries occur, it will impact more than one pathway.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remains onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
