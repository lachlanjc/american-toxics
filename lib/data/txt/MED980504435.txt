### Background

The 13-acre Winthrop Landfill site is in Winthrop, Maine. The area is located west of Lake Annabessacook and consists of two adjacent properties, the Winthrop Town Landfill and the privately owned Savage Landfill. A sand and gravel pit initially operated on site in the 1920s. In the 1930s, parts of the site received municipal, commercial, and industrial wastes. The site accepted hazardous substances between the early 1950s and mid-1970s.

The Savage Landfill accepted municipal solid waste and debris from two small neighboring towns and wastes from the Town of Winthrop to extend the life of the town landfill. Wastes were openly burned until 1972 and landfilling occurred from 1972 until 1982.

In late 1979, the Town of Winthrop attempted to expand the landfill, but this revealed numerous rusting and leaking barrels. It is estimated that more than 3 million gallons of chemical wastes, mostly complex organic compounds including resins, plasticizers, solvents, and other process chemicals, were disposed of at the site. The town decided to close the landfill and construct a transfer station on the site.

There are approximately sixty residences within a half-mile of the site. Wetlands are located near the site, and Lake Annabessacook is used for recreational purposes. The Site was listed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in December 1982. A Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) was conducted from 1981 to 1985. The RI determined that liquid chemical wastes were migrating from the landfill in shallow and deep groundwater in three separate flows. Organic contaminants were detected in groundwater within the bedrock beneath the Site and in Annabessacook Lake sediments south of the landfill.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through EPA and ME DEP oversight of actions by Raytheon Technologies Corporation and Town of Winthrop (Settling Defendants).

In 1985, EPA issued a ROD concluding that potential threats to human health and the environment could primarily occur via ingestion of contaminated groundwater, physical contact with wastes, discharge of contaminants to surface waters, and migration of contaminated groundwater off-site. Ingestion of contaminated groundwater was determined to be the primary threat to human health. Thus, the following remedy was selected: extension of an alternate water supply to area residents; construction of a chain link fence around the landfill and implementation of deed restrictions prohibiting use of the landfill for activities other than the remedial action; prohibition of groundwater withdrawal for purposes other than remedial action within the landfill and at certain areas around the landfill; prohibition of excavation within the landfill and at certain areas around the landfill, except for residential construction or remedial action; quarterly sampling of monitoring points in sensitive areas; grading and placement of a cap over the entire landfill; completion of engineering design work (geologic, hydrogeologic, treatability pilot studies); establishment of an Alternate Concentration Limit (ACL) for each contaminant in groundwater; and in the event of an ACL exceedance, installation and operation of a groundwater extraction and treatment system (GWETS).

A monitoring and maintenance program for cap, groundwater, surface water, and sediment was implemented in March 1986 and has been periodically updated with the latest revision taking place in May 2020, namely Revision 7 of the Post Closure Monitoring and Maintenance Plan (PCMMP). Completion of cap construction was administratively approved by the EPA and ME DEP in 1992.

On October 20, 1993, EPA modified the 1985 ROD remedy by issuing an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) which documented the inclusion of a vapor extraction system as a component of the GWETS. The GWETS became operational in March 1995. The GWETS was successful in achieving groundwater performance standards for all identified contaminants except arsenic. The GWETS was deactivated in November 2002. Monitoring of groundwater, surface water and sediment continues to date.

On February 14, 2007 EPA issued a second ESD which outlined the decommissioning of the GWETS and attainment of the arsenic ACL through natural processes, a requirement to monitor, evaluate, and if warranted, remediate points of exposure, a requirement to continue monitoring and, as necessary, evaluate and remediate any risk posed by potential vapor intrusion.

A permanent public water supply was provided to area residents in 1984. On October 7, 1985, the Town of Winthrop enacted an ordinance to prohibit groundwater withdrawal and to prohibit all groundwater extraction. (The ordinance was subsequently replaced by another ordinance on April 1, 1991 as part of the Town of Winthrop's comprehensive plan.) Construction of an engineered cover or cap over the landfill was completed in September 1987. The vegetative layer and fence installation were completed in October 1987. Monitoring of the cap continues.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Biennial inspections and long-term maintenance of the landfill cap and cover system continues. The cap is stable, and the perimeter fence is intact. Long-term monitoring of groundwater, surface water, and sediment also continues. Except for arsenic exceedances, the other contaminants are generally meeting their respective performance standards.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional controls are required for this site.**  
  
This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.  
  
The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above. Note that where multiple entries occur, it will impact more than one pathway.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left onsite and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remain onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
