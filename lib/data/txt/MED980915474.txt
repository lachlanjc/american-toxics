### Background

The 25-acre Eastland Woolen Mill Superfund Site is located in the Town of Corinna, Penobscot County, Maine, approximately 6 miles north of Newport and 25 miles northwest of Bangor, Maine. Before closing in 1996, EWM was a manufacturer and finisher (dyeing) of wool and blended woven fabric. This dyeing operation took place in dye kettles and utilized various chemicals, including dyes and dye-aids that reportedly contained biphenyl and chlorinated benzene compounds. Liquid wastes were discharged to the ground surface beneath mill buildings until 1977. As a result, overburdened soil and bedrock underlying the mill were contaminated with chlorinated benzene compounds. Long-term cleanup and environmental monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The removal of the hazardous materials, installation of the water line, and removal of the mill have reduced the potential for risk to human health and the environment. Approximately 30,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil were removed from the ground in 2000. In 2001, an additional 50,000 cubic yards of material was removed. The contaminated soil has been screened and stockpiled in anticipation of treatment. This material no longer acts as a source of groundwater, surface water, and sediment contamination. The treatment of the soil began in June 2002. The NTCRA involved the treatment of 100,000 tons of soil, removing about 10,000 pounds of contamination from the soil. The treatment of the excavated soil was completed in October 2003. Treatment of deep overburdened soil using in-situ reagents is ongoing. The Remedial Design for the groundwater restoration cleanup was completed in 2006. The construction of the Remedial Action was also completed in 2006 and the site achieve construction completion status. EPA is currently implementing the in-situ oxidation program to reduce the level of contamination in the overburden and bedrock groundwater. EPA plans to monitor the groundwater for the next several years to assess the success of the in-situ oxidation program.

EPA also completed the first Five Year Review in 2010. In 2012, EPA completed a partial deletion action to remove 80% of the land area from NPL designation and facilitate re-use. EPA completed the second Five-Year Review in 2015.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in four cleanup phases: an initial removal of hazardous materials by the MEDEP; a non-time critical removal action (NTCRA); and the remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS)/long-term remedial action (RA) for groundwater, designated at Operable Unit (OU) 1, and the RI/FS and RA for sediments and floodplain contamination designated as OU 2. The NTCRA, RI/FS, and RA are completed. The Site is currently (2016) in year 8 of the 10-year long-term response action phase.

EPA is currently evaluating the effect of the in-situ oxidation program on the contamination in the overburden and bedrock groundwater. EPA continues to monitor the groundwater and surface water at the Site. EPA is also working with MEDEP to complete the implementation of the land use restrictions required by the cleanup.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

**Institutional Controls are required for this site.**

This site requires ICs because a decision document, such as a Record of Decision, has documented some level of contamination and/or remedy component at the site that would restrict the use of the site. These ICs are required to help ensure the site is used in an appropriate way and that activities at the site do not damage the cleanup components. These ICs will remain in place for as long as the contamination and/or cleanup components stay on site. The matrix below is a general summary of the restrictions at this site at the date of this report. The information in this matrix is a general description of the restrictions at the site only. The site contacts should be consulted if there are questions on the ICs for this site.  
  
The following IC Instruments provide media-specific use restrictions that have been implemented by EPA for protecting human health, the environment, and remedial engineering on this site. Instruments are documents used by EPA or other organizations to implement the use restrictions at a site. To know about other media-specific use restrictions that are planned but not implemented at this site, please contact the Regional Office using the Site Contact listed above. Note that where multiple entries occur, it will impact more than one pathway.

ICs are generally defined as administrative and legal tools that do not involve construction or physically changing the site. Common examples of ICs include site use and excavation restrictions put in place through State and local authorities like zoning, permits, and easements. ICs are normally used when waste is left on site and when there is a limit to the activities that can safely take place at the site (i.e., the site cannot support unlimited use and unrestricted exposure) and/or when cleanup components of the remedy remain onsite (e.g., landfill caps, pumping equipment or pipelines). Effective ICs help ensure that these sites can be returned to safe and beneficial use.
