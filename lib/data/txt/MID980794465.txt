### Background

The 18-acre Mason County Landfill site is located near Ludington, Michigan. During operations, the landfill received a mixture of hazardous and municipal waste. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil, sediments and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1999.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA’s cleanup of the closed landfill consisted of a clay cap, limits on use of the area, and long-term groundwater monitoring and cap maintenance. Groundwater monitoring began in 1989. Construction of the landfill cap took place between 1990 and 1991. EPA took the site off the NPL in 1999.

Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review in 2020 concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has completed the sixth five-year review of the site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.

The five year review in December 2020 concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the cleanup plan selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

The volatile organic compound benzene has been detected in O&M Site groundwater sampling along with inorganic compounds such as manganeese and iron. Historically, municapal as well as hazardous waste materials were deposited in the Site landfill before it was closed and capped.
