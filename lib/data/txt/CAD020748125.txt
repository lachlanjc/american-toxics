Background
The Casmalia Resources Superfund Site is an inactive, 252-acre commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facility in Northern Santa Barbara County, CA.  EPA has continued work with resonsible parties and stakeholders to implement a phased RD/RA approach to design and construction of the Selected Remedy. Construction is underway. Completed work includes engineering designs, grading and excavation, surface water management, construction of engineered capping systems, and revegetation. Upcoming work will also include additional capping systems, extraction and treatment of contaminated subsurface liquids, and installation of monitoring systems.  Under the phased RD/RA approach, engineering design and construction proceed concurrently at different parts of the site to help acclerate the cleanup work. Note: The Casmalia Resources Superfund Site is separate from the town of Casmalia.﻿ Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
T﻿he site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  Multiple response actions have been taken to manage contamination at the site. Remedial design (RD), remedial action (RA), and operations, maintenance, and monitoring are ongoing. Early actions included closure of landfills, reconsolidation of former waste management units (WMUs), operation of liquids capture trenchs to prevent off-site movement of groundwater contamination, and construction of waste management features.

What Is the Current Site Status?
Phased remedial design and remedial action are currently in progress. Construction is underway at various areas of the site. The Record of Decision (ROD) was signed by the EPA Administrator on June 28, 2018. The ROD formally selects the cleanup approach for the site. The next steps include engineering design and then construction. The 2-volume ROD is available on this website at Volume 1 and Volume 2. As background, E﻿PA approved the site’s Remedial Investigation (RI) Report in April 2011. The RI explains the nature and extent of contamination at the site.  EPA approved a Final Feasibility Study (FS) Report in April 2016.  The FS Report studies different ways to clean up and manage contamination at the site.  Meanwhile, ongoing subsurface liquids extraction and site monitoring and maintenance continues under active EPA oversight.  In November 2017, EPA issued a Proposed Plan for public input.  The Proposed Plan presents a proposed final cleanup and closure approach (remediation) and ways to manage contamination at the site. The Proposed Plan and a Fact Sheet in English & Spanish summarizing the Proposed Plan are included on this web site. Top of Page
Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
E﻿PA uses institutional controls (ICs) at this site. Institutional controls are non-engineering actions, such as administrative or legal controls, that play an important role in site remedies.  ICs can reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. Some examples include: zoning restrictions or environmental covenants to prevent inappropriate land uses, such as residential uses, or uncontrolled construction that are not consistent with the level of cleanup. At the Casmalia Resources site, land and water use restrictive covenants, which run with the land, have been recorded for the former facility property and several adjacent properties to control land use and limit access. These ICs help notify people about the Superfund site and prevent exposures to waste materials. Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
Approximately 400 monitoring wells and probes have been installed at the site. Remedial site investigations included extensive sampling of soils, surface water, groundwater, pond sediments, and soil vapor. Routine environmental monitoring continues with comprehensive sampling events conducted two times per year. EPA will be expanding and upgrading the monitoring system as construction continues to monitor performance of the cleanup systems. Please see technical documents on this web site for further details.

Green Remediation
G﻿reen remediation practices were considered in evaluating alternative site management approaches as part of the feasibility study (FS).  The green impacts assessment in the FS includes electricity, fuel usage, water usage, and air emissions for (1) remedial construction, (2) materials, manufacturing, and transport; and (3) operations and maintenance (O&M) activities.

Emergency Response and Removal
From 1992 to 1996, EPA response teams used Superfund authorities to stabilize and maintain the site. Beginning in 1997, potentially reponsible parties (PRPs) performed early actions under EPA oversight to contain waste materials and improve site management. Actions included closure and capping of four out of five onsite landfills and construction of liquids waste storage and treatment systems. T﻿he site contains approximately 300 chemicals of concern, including VOCs, SVOCs, & Inorganics. Capped landfills and former waste management units contain PCBs, pesticides, solvents, acids, metals, caustics, and cyanide. Impacted media include soil, soil vapor, NAPL (both DNAPL & LNAPL), surface water, sediment, and onsite groundwater. Dense and light non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPL) are liquids contaminants that can be particularly difficult to remove and treat.  Groundwater contamination has been contained onsite within the 252-acre landfill property boundaries by extraction systems, containment trenches, and natural attenuation.

Enforcement Information
In 1999, EPA prepared a comprehensive, but preliminary, cost estimate for future response actions at the site. EPA estimates it could cost approximately $284 million (in 1999 dollars) to stabilize, clean up, close and manage contamination for this site. The FS report included cost estimates for each alternative to clean up and manage the contamination, as well as costs for 30 years of maintenance. Sources of funding for these activities include a trust fund established by the former owners and operators, settlements with “potentially responsible parties” (explained below), and government funding. The term potentially responsible parties (PRPs) refers to people, organizations and companies that are potentially responsible for generating, transporting, or disposing of the hazardous waste found at the site. The PRPs at the Casmalia Site include the former owners and operators of the facility and their customers, namely generators and transporters of waste disposed of at the site. During the years of the Casmalia facility’s operation, the facility accepted waste from thousands of private businesses and government agencies. One of the EPA’s major responsibilities has been to create an equitable process to ensure that each of these parties pays its share of total site costs – both for the expenses that EPA has incurred already, and for future improvements and maintenance at the site. To date EPA has also settled with a group of 54 parties that sent approximately half of the waste to the site.  These parties are performing work in part with their own funds and in part with funds that EPA has collected from other PRPs. EPA has also settled with over 2,000 Casmalia Resources PRPs who have paid into an account to finance the work. Over 1,900 of these entities are referred to as de minimis contributors because they sent relatively small amounts of waste to the site. These de minimis settlements have generated over $63 million in funds for site related response actions.  The remaining parties include the former owners and operators and customers that are referred to as “major” waste generators who have collectively paid over $56 million. Altogether, these settlements have recovered over $119 million to help fund response actions at the site. AOC 99-02(l):  EPA is preparing to finalize another settlement agreement, administrative order on concent (AOC 9902(l), which covers fifteen (15) de minimis parties that sent a total of 14,424,569 pounds of waste to the site. AOC No. 99-02(l) is the latest in a series of cashout settlements which provides $1,312,103 to help pay for site cleanup.  Table of Settlements: A﻿ table listing settlements that have been completed, including the recent AOC 99-02(j), is included below.
