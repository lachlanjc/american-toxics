### Background

The 1.2-acre Miami Drum Services [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is located at 6601 NW 72nd Avenue in northwest Miami-Dade County, about two miles north of Miami International Airport. The site covers 1.2 acres and is now wholly contained within an 82-acre parcel owned by the Miami-Dade County Transit Authority. The site is located in a commercial and industrial area of Hialeah. Several other communities surround the site, including Miami Springs, Medley, Hialeah Gardens, Pinewood Park and Miami.

Between 1966 and 1981, Miami Drum Services cleaned and recycled drums at the site. In 1981, the county forced the facility to shut down. Since 1982, the Miami Transit Authority has continuously used the site as a train maintenance yard. Currently, the site is partially asphalt-paved and partially covered with gravel roads. The site also includes partially uncovered land bisected by train tracks.

Groundwater contamination at the site commingled with contamination from two nearby Superfund sites, the Varsol Spill and Northwest 58th Street Landfill sites, collectively identified as the Biscayne Aquifer sites. The Biscayne Aquifer sites have contributed to widespread groundwater contamination in the Biscayne Aquifer – the only source of drinking water for several counties, including Miami-Dade County. The contamination caused the shutdown of several well fields, including the well fields at the Preston and Hialeah water treatment plants. The groundwater treatment system remains operational and meets the daily drinking water demands of almost one million people in northern Miami-Dade County.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www/epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1983 because of contaminated soil and groundwater resulting from facility operations. EPA, the [Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP)](https://floridadep.gov/) and Miami-Dade County have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site. By treating and monitoring groundwater and conducting required Five-Year Reviews, EPA, FDEP and Miami-Dade County continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

The Site is currently being assessed for deletion from the NPL

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**1982**  
The county completed the removal of contaminated soil and debris in 1982 and disposed of it at an off-site hazardous waste facility.

**1988**  
The EPA signed a Cooperative Agreement with the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department to carry out the ground water cleanup approach. The county funds the operation of the air strippers that treat site ground water.

The cleanup approach included  
using the Hialeah and Preston municipal well fields to pump and treat contaminated groundwater using air strippers and granular activated carbon

implementing institutional controls (i.e., existing local groundwater well ordinances) and recommended that the county carry out a preventive action program called the Biscayne Aquifer Protection Plan.

**1992**  
Air stripping towers at the Preston and Hialeah water treatment plants began operating.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five-Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11111842.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2018. The remedy at the Site currently protects human health and the environment.

The Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the air stripping towers at the Preston and Hialeah water treatment plants. EPA continues to provide oversight in cooperation with FDEP.

The site is currently being assessed for deletion off the National Priorities List.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

In 1981, the county forced the drum recycling facility to close down due to operating permit violations. In 1988, the EPA signed a Cooperative Agreement with the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department to carry out the ground water cleanup approach. Currently, the county funds the operation of the air strippers that treat site ground water, while the EPA funds the site’s Five-Year Reviews.
