### Background

The Arsenic Trioxide site is located in Richland and Sargent counties in southeastern North Dakota. It covers 26 townships (about 568 square miles) of sparsely populated farmland with a few small towns, including Lidgerwood, Wyndmere, Milnor and Hankinson.

During the 1930s and early 1940s, arsenic-laced bait was used extensively throughout North Dakota to combat grasshopper infestations. The bait, which included arsenic trioxide, sodium arsenate, Paris Green and other arsenic compounds, was commonly applied on farm fields.

EPA conducted a remedial investigation (RI) in 1985 to determine the nature and extent of arsenic contamination in groundwater. The RI identified several groundwater wells that exceeded the MCL for arsenic.

EPA placed the site on the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1983. Following cleanup, the site was removed from the NPL in July 1996.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and local actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The siteâ€™s long-term remedy included the expansion of three water treatment plants, installation of about 300 miles of water distribution pipeline, construction of additional water storage reservoirs and tanks, and installation of additional water supply wells. Construction of the remedy finished in June 1993.

In 2001, the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) maximum contaminant level (MCL) for arsenic was lowered to 0.01 milligrams per liter (mg/L). As a result, the communities of Wyndmere and Hankinson were connected to the Southeast Water Users District (SEWUD) rural water supply system. These construction activities also included the expansion of the SEWUD water treatment plant. Construction activities began in 2005 and finished in 2007. Additional sampling also determined if the wells of rural water users exceeded the new arsenic standard. If well water exceeded the arsenic standard, users were provided bottled water as a temporary measure. During the summer of 2008, about 60 additional users were connected to a rural water supply system. In September 2008, the bottled water program transitioned from EPA's Removal Program to the State of North Dakota Department of Health (NDDH).

In 2009, EPA updated the remedy to connect an additional 162 users to the water supply system, expand the SEWUD treatment system and document institutional controls. Construction was substantially complete by September 2011.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. Ongoing actions to ensure the long-term protectiveness of the remedy include more frequent monitoring of treated groundwater, regular review of institutional control activities, and updates to the site fact sheet to discuss watering of livestock and poultry.

Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in July 1996.

Since the site is an area-wide groundwater site, many types of uses continue to occur throughout the 26-township area covered by the site. The primary land use in the area is agriculture.
