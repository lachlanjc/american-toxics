### Background

The Parramore Surplus site is located in Mount Pleasant, Florida. It includes the area where Parramore Surplus has operated a storage and resale company for surplus military equipment since 1972. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983 because of contaminated soil and groundwater resulting from drum storage operations. EPA, the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation (FDER, now the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, or FDEP) and the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP), Parramore Surplus, investigated site conditions and undertook measures to clean up the site.

All actions were designed to ensure that local residents and the environment are safe from site contamination. In 1983, Parramore Surplus excavated and treated contaminated soil. In 1987, EPA determined that the PRP would not need to take additional cleanup actions except for limited groundwater monitoring. EPA documented this decision in a Record of Decision, or ROD. In 1989, EPA took the site off the NPL. No additional monitoring of the site is required.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The PRP led site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight by EPA and FDEP.  

In 1983, Parramore Surplus excavated and treated contaminated soil and conducted groundwater monitoring. Parramore Surplus achieved all established goals for surface contamination. In addition, groundwater sampling results indicated that the site poses no threat to people or the environment.

EPA took the site off the NPL in February 1989, with the deletion notice stating “EPA, with the concurrence of the State of Florida, has determined that the Parramore Surplus site poses no significant threat to public health or the environment and therefore, no soil remediation and no further groundwater studies are necessary.”  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

At a meeting between EPA, FDER and the PRP, Parramore Surplus, held after the site’s listing on the NPL, Parramore Surplus agreed to voluntarily clean up polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)-contaminated soil. After Parramore Surplus cleaned up the soil, both FDER and EPA inspected the site and noted on July 28, 1983, that Parramore Surplus had met the conditions of the cleanup agreement. During the investigation, the parties identified three additional areas of contamination. At the request of FDER, Parramore Surplus cleaned up these areas as well.

In 1987, EPA issued the cleanup plan (a Record of Decision, or ROD) for the site. In the ROD, EPA explained that, based on all available and relevant information regarding the site, additional cleanup actions to address the site’s contamination source (such as additional soil cleanup) were not necessary to protect people or the environment. However, to ensure that groundwater contamination had not resulted from past disposal of hazardous materials at the site, EPA required a groundwater quality assessment consisting of two sampling events as part of the ROD.  

In 1987, EPA determined that the PRP would not need to take additional cleanup actions except for limited ground water monitoring. In 1989, EPA deleted the site from the NPL.

EPA is not required to conduct Five-Year Reviews for the site. No further updates are warranted at this time.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.
