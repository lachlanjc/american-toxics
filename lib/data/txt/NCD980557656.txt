### Background

The 1.5-acre North Carolina State University (Lot 86 Farm Unit #1) [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) Site is located on the NCSU campus in Raleigh, Wake County, North Carolina. The State of North Carolina owns the Site and surrounding properties. Forested areas and the Wade Avenue extension border the Site to the north. Trinity Road and a sports practice facility border the Site to the south. A forested area borders the Site to the east. A parking lot for Carter-Finley Stadium and sports arenas borders the Site to the west.

The Site served as a waste disposal area for North Carolina State University science laboratories and agricultural research facilities. From 1969 to 1980, the University disposed of solvents, pesticides, heavy metals, acids and some low-level radioactive laboratory wastes in trenches located on a portion of the Site.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the Site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1986 because of contaminated groundwater and soil resulting from waste handling practices.

The EPA, the [North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (NCDENR)](https://deq.nc.gov/), and NCSU, the site’s [potentially responsible party (PRP)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), have investigated site conditions. By treating and monitoring groundwater, placing institutional controls on the site property, and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, the EPA, NCDENR and the Site’s PRP continue to protect people and the environment from Site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the Site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Site’s PRP leads site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by the EPA and NCDENR.

**1996**  
The EPA’s cleanup plan included:

- treatment of contaminated soil. Cleanup also included the
- removal and treatment of contaminated groundwater

**1999**  
The Site’s potentially responsible party completed soil cleanup.

**2006**  
The PRP completed construction of the groundwater extraction and treatment system.

**2007**  
Carolina Solar Energy LLC (CSE) began to operate a 70 kW photovoltaic solar generation project on the Ssite. The project was designated a Solar "Brownfields to Brightfields" Technology Demonstration Project by the U.S. Department of Energy. CSE sold the electricity generated by the 12 solar arrays back to Progress Energy.

2019

Carolina Solar Energy LLC (CSE) chose to terminate its lease early and removed all the solar equipment from the Site.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11189829.pdf) was published by EPA in 2023. The remedy at the Site currently protects human health and the environment because contaminated soils were remediated through stabilization/solidification, groundwater contamination has been contained through extraction, treatment and discharge to the City sewer, and institutional controls are in place restricting access to contaminated groundwater and soils.

The PRP continues to treat and monitor contaminated groundwater.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
