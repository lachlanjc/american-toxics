Background
The 82-acre Kohler Company Landfill site is located in Sheboygan County, Wisconsin. Forty acres have been used as a landfill since the 1950s, primarily for the disposal of foundry and manufacturing wastes produced by Kohler’s manufacturing facilities. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site’s long-term cleanup for source areas included closing the currently operating landfill in phases, installing a multilayer soil cap over the landfill, issuing zoning and access restrictions, and collecting contaminated leachate on site through a perimeter drain. Construction of the cleanup was completed in 1998. Operation and maintenance and groundwater and leachate treatment are ongoing. The site’s long-term cleanup for groundwater contamination included collecting groundwater and leachate along the southern and eastern sides of the landfill which goes to the city of Sheboygan's publicly owned treatment works for treatment and eventual discharge.

What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources completed a five-year review of the Kohler Co. Landfill (PDF) (105 pp,31.22 MB, About PDF)site in August 2017. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This was the fourth review of the site. The review concluded that the cleanup is protecting people and the environment.  The next review is scheduled for 2022. More information is available under Reports and Documents on this web page and at the Kohler Public Library, 333 Upper Road.  Contact the EPA community involvement coordinator, EPA remedial project manager, or WDNR waste management engineer for more information.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
Groundwater is contaminated with various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), heavy metals, phenols, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Runoff water and sediment contain heavy metals, phenols, and PAHs. Leachate samples contain VOCs and heavy metals. Waste samples from the landfill contain VOCs, phenols, PAHs, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and heavy metals.
