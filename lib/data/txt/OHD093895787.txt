### Background

The 36-acre Sanitary Landfill Co. Superfund site, also known as Cardington Road Landfill Site, is a former solid waste landfill near Dayton, Ohio. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s the area was originally a sand and gravel mine. Later, it was used for solid waste disposal from 1971 to 1980. The landfill accepted municipal wastes and various types of industrial wastes, including solvents. In 1980, the site was covered with a multi-layer solid waste cap after waste disposal activities ended. Landfill operations contaminated soil, sediment, surface water and groundwater. In 1986 the property was placed on the National Priorities List, or NPL.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In December 1987, EPA, Ohio EPA (OEPA), and a group of potentially responsible parties (PRPs) entered into a legal agreement known as an Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). Under the terms of the AOC, the PRPs agreed to conduct the remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) for the site with oversight by EPA and OEPA. The RI/FS was designed to determine the nature and extent of contamination at the site.

EPA published the selected remedy for the site in the September 27, 1993 Record of Decision, or ROD. EPA’s cleanup at the site included placement of a solid waste cap on the landfill, construction of a gas management system, installation of surface runoff controls and drainage channels, long-term monitoring, and activity and use limitations and access controls to the site. In 1998, the site’s construction activities to implement the cleanup were completed.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and PRP actions.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. EPA completed the fifth [five-year review (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/976911.pdf) (111pp, 13.33mb, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) of the site in August 2022. The review concluded that the remedy at the site continues to be protective of human health and the environment. However, for the remedy to be effective in the long-term, the following actions need to be performed:

• Develop an Institutional Controls Implementation Assurance Plan to ensure all institutional controls are monitored and maintained.

• Update the Site Operations & Maintenance Plan.

• Discontinue the use of the MW-10 series wells in potentiometric surface map generation and install additional wells to help delineate the perched aquifer surface slope.

• Install one or more upgradient monitor wells to evaluate potential off-site sources of contamination.

• Conduct groundwater sampling for potential emerging contaminants Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), and 1,4-dioxane to confirm if they are present and are site-related.

• Update the existing Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPP) document.

• Clear the perimeter fence of vegetation to allow for proper inspection and repair.

The next scheduled review will be in 2027.
