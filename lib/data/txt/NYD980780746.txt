### Background

The Endicott Village Well Field site is located in the village of Endicott, New York. The site includes a Ranney Well and its zone of influence on area groundwater. The Ranney Well was designed in the 1950’s, by the Ranney Well Collector corporation, to draw water primarily by infiltration from the nearby Susquehanna River, with the balance contributed by area ground water. The boundaries of this zone are the Susquehanna River to the south, West Main Street to the north, Grippen Park to the east and Endicott Landfill to the west. Most of the site is on land owned by the village of Endicott (the En-Joie Golf Course, the Sewage Treatment Plant, the Endicott Landfill and the Tri-Cities Airport). The village operates four wells that serve 45,000 people and the Ranney Well supplies about half of the total drinking water of the system. EPA detected vinyl chloride and trace amounts of other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the discharge from the Ranney Well. The Endicott Landfill is approximately 70 acres in size and was found to be the source of the contamination to the Ranney Well. The Endicott Landfill accepted municipal refuse and industrial waste from approximately the late 1950's until 1977. After immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, the site’s long-term cleanup remedy was put in place. Groundwater treatment and monitoring are ongoing.

Site Responsibility: This site was addressed through Federal and potentially responsible parties' actions.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Initial actions taken to treat the groundwater have reduced the risk of exposure to contaminants through the water supply. The construction of an air stripper was completed in fall 1991. Air stripping is the process of forcing air through polluted groundwater or surface water to remove harmful chemicals. The air stripper has treated more than 5.7 billion gallons of contaminated groundwater. EPA approved the final design for a supplemental purge well on March 6, 1995. The treatment system was installed and is now in operation.

On December 11, 1995, EPA signed an Explanation of Significant Differences to discontinue operation of the purge well that was installed in 1984. This decision was based upon data that demonstrated that the supplemental purge w ell effectively captured groundwater beneath and adjacent to the Endicott Landfill. In October 1996, the remedial action for the landfill was completed, which included, among others actions, capping the majority of the landfill surface with a low permeability barrier cap. A pproximately 8,260,000 tons of waste were contained.

The site achieved construction completion status when the Preliminary Close-Out Report was signed on September 26, 1997.

EPA has conducted five five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents.

The most recent review, completed in 2020, found that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment. There are no exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks, and none are expected as long as site ownership and use do not change and the engineered and institutional controls in place continue to be properly operated, monitored and maintained. The review also found that the landfill cap is well maintained, mowed and operating as designed.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in four stages: immediate actions and three long-term remedial phases focused on cleanup of the public water supply, cleanup of the entire site and containment of the groundwater plume.

Immediate Actions: The village of Endicott closed four supply lines to the Ranney Well and put in diffused air aeration equipment to reduce vinyl chloride levels. Other actions included putting in a purge well and three monitoring wells to intercept and monitor groundwater contamination before it reached the Ranney Well.

Public Water Supply: EPA selected a remedy to clean up the public water supply. It included putting in an air stripper and running it to remove VOCs from the Ranney Well; treating contaminated groundwater, with discharge of the cleaned water to Endicott’s municipal water system; and groundwater monitoring. Construction of the air-stripping tower finished in the fall of 1991.

Entire Site: A site investigation informed cleanup remedies to restore the aquifer and control the source of contamination. Studies were undertaken in two phases, resulting in an interim remedy and a final remedy.

Groundwater Contamination: The interim remedy, selected in 1991, included extraction of contaminated groundwater through an existing purge well, installation of a supplemental purge well and treatment through Endicott’s wastewater treatment plant.

Source of Contamination: EPA selected the final remedy to address the source of the contaminated groundwater in 1992. It included capping the landfill, putting in a gas venting system, controlling and treating the leachate seep, monitoring air and groundwater quality, placing a fence around the landfill, and institutional controls to restrict future use of the landfill.
