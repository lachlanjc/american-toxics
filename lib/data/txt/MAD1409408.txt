### Background

The Microfab, Inc. (Former) Site is located at 106 Haverhill Road in Amesbury, MA. The Microfab property is located in a mixed commercial, industrial, and residential area. Microfab is a former industrial property that has been vacant and unoccupied since 1987. Industrial activities were conducted on the property between 1950 and 1987, and included metal parts manufacturing, printed circuit board production, electroplating, and associated metal finishing processes. During this time, the property was used for the disposal and treatment of industrial and manufacturing wastes, including wastes containing hazardous substances such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and heavy metals. According to historical records, the three main sources of contamination on the property included: (1) prior to the construction of the wastewater treatment plant, outfall pipes at the factory building discharged untreated wastewater directly to the adjacent unnamed stream and wetlands; (2) spills, releases, and improper waste management and disposal practices which resulted in contaminated soils; and (3) dry wells and leach fields used for underground disposal which released contaminants into the subsurface. The property is bounded to the north by Haverhill Road (Highway 110), to the west/southwest by a large commercial property and wetlands, to the east by a small commercial property and undeveloped woods, and to the south by wetlands and properties owned by local utilities including an electrical transmission line. The Microfab property has a large 100,000 sq. ft. former factory building built in 1950 and later expanded, a detached former wastewater treatment building built in 1976, paved parking areas, and undeveloped woods and wetlands. The buildings on the Microfab property are in poor structural condition and generally unsafe for entry. There is a newer perimeter fence around the buildings, former employee parking lot, and the most contaminated areas on the property. There are signs posted on the perimeter fence stating no trespassing and presence of hazardous materials at the property to warn and deter trespassers. An unnamed stream flows adjacent to the Site's west perimeter, draining into a large wetland to the south which is associated with the Merrimack River.

In October of 1987, Microfab filed a petition in federal bankruptcy court to commence liquidation proceedings. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE), now referred to MassDEP, subsequently assumed responsibility for cleanup actions at the Site. EPA Region 1 proposed the Site to the EPA National Priorities List (“NPL”) on September 9, 2016, and the Site was added to the NPL in August 2017. Currently, EPA is working on the completion of the RI/FS to determine the nature and extent of the contamination, potential ecological and human health risks, and potential cleanup alternatives for the site.

Contaminants detected at the Microfab Site vary by concentration and environmental media (e.g., soil, groundwater, sediment, and surface water) presence, but generally include the following: volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as trichloroethylene (TCE), cis-1,2-Dichloroethylene (cis-1,2-DCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and vinyl chloride; metals including arsenic, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, and silver; hexavalent chromium, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and cyanide. A plume of VOC-contaminated groundwater emanates from the former Microfab property into undeveloped wooded and wetland areas located to the south/southwest. EPA is evaluating the contamination and associated risks both on the former Microfab property and in adjacent off-property areas.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Site was listed on the Massachusetts Confirmed Hazardous Waste List in 1987. Between 1988 and 1991, MassDEP conducted several site investigations, including an interim Phase II Comprehensive Site Assessment (CSA) and risk characterization. This resulted in the installation of a fence in the western portion of the site to prevent human contact with contaminated wetland sediments, and the construction and operation of a groundwater extraction and treatment system. The treatment system operated on the property between 1991 and 2012, and consisted of a series of six extraction wells pumping groundwater to a treatment shed. The treatment system included metals removal, air stripping, and granulated activated carbon (GAC) treatment prior to discharge. The treatment system ceased operations based on the changing nature and location of the groundwater plume over time. In August of 2000, MassDEP expanded the fencing footprint due to high concentrations of arsenic encountered in surface soil on the property. In 2015, EPA performed a Site Inspection (SI) of the Microfab property. Sampling during the SI detected various VOCs, metals, SVOCs, and cyanide at concentrations which exceeded background levels by three times or more in surface water and sediments on the property.

EPA Region 1 proposed the Site to the EPA National Priorities List (“NPL”) on September 9, 2016. EPA received letters in support of the proposal to add this site to the NPL from the Amesbury Mayor, Board of Selectmen, several other city departments and the Governor of Massachusetts. The Site was included in the final listing of NPL sites by publication in the Federal Register on August 3, 2017 (82 Fed. Reg. 36095). EPA obtained access to perform work at the Microfab Site via an Administrative Inspection Warrant obtained through the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts. EPA commenced initial RI field activites and investigations at the Site in January 2019. Available historical information and data were compiled and reviewed to provide an initial assessment of past industrial operations and disposal methods at the Site, past environmental investigations and findings, potential contaminant extent, and the local geology and hydrogeology. A preliminary conceptual site model (CSM) was developed, and data gaps pertinent to determining the current nature and extent of contamination in addition to human health and ecological risk assessment needs were identified. Samples of soil, groundwater, sediment, surface water and pore water were collected and analyzed. The initial investigations substantiated that VOCs, (including trichloroethylene (TCE), cis-1,2-DCE, tetrachloroethene (PCE), and vinyl chloride), and metals (including copper, lead, nickel, arsenic and chromium) are present at the Microfab site. A Data Evaluation Report dated March 2020 was prepared to document initial findings.

On April 22, 2019, EPA initiated a time-critical removal action to sample, characterize, remove residual hazardous and non-hazardous chemicals (including liquid acids, lead plating solids, acid crystals) from tanks and vats that remained in the former factory building. The EPA removal action was completed on July 15, 2019.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The RI for the Microfab Site is currently in the final stages. All of the field investigation work (such as sampling, monitoring well installation, high resolution site characterization, etc.) for the RI have been complete, and human health and ecological risk assessments are being finalized. A remedial investigation report is being drafted to document RI data and findings, and work has been initiated on the FS. EPA is also finalizing a Community Involvement Plan (CIP), to engage and collaborate with the public and local community (including City of Amesbury officials, residents, local stakeholders, and those in adjacent towns/cities).

### Sampling and Monitoring

During phase 1 of the remedial investigation, EPA performed an initial comprehensive investigation and data collection effort. Please refer to the March 2020 report " [Data Evaluation Report for Remedial Investigation](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/100013817) ".

The remaining investigations work during phase 2 of the remedial investigation will be documented in the future Site RI report.

### Emergency Response and Removal

On April 22, 2019, EPA initiated a time-critical removal action to sample, characterize, remove residual hazardous and non-hazardous chemicals (including liquid acids, lead plating solids, acid crystals) from tanks and vats that remained in the former factory building. The EPA removal action was completed on July 15, 2019.
