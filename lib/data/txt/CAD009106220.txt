### Background

The 5-acre T.H. Agriculture & Nutrition Company site is located in Fresno, California. Pesticide formulating activities took place on the site from 1950 to 1981. On-site landfills collected waste generated from site operations. These activities contaminated groundwater and soil with pesticides. Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 2006.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site was addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included soil vapor extraction, demolition and removal of various structures, excavation and disposal of contaminated soil, a soil cap, monitored natural attenuation (letting naturally occurring processes reduce the contamination in groundwater), long-term monitoring and institutional controls. EPA installed the cap, hydroseeded and installed a fence by 2003. Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.  

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 2006.
