### Background

The Newmark Groundwater Contamination site is an 8-square-mile area of groundwater contamination in San Bernardino, California. Contaminants of concern include the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and chlorinated solvents tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE). EPA investigations did not find point sources for the contamination. Following construction of three groundwater treatment plants, operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and municipal actions.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the siteâ€™s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The Site is defined by two contaminant plumes, the Newmark plume and the Muscoy plume. EPA is addressing site cleanup in two phases, including the containment and cleanup of the two contaminant plumes and addressing the source of the contamination.

The remedy includes pumping and treatment of contaminated groundwater using activated carbon adsorption technology. Institutional controls in the form of a groundwater management program agreement between local and surrounding water purveyors ensure that site technologies are capturing and inhibiting movement of contaminated groundwater. Construction of the Newmark plume area remedy finished in 1998.

The Muscoy plume area treatment facility began operating in 2005.
