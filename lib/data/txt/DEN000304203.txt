### Background

The Blades Groundwater site is located in Sussex County, Delaware adjacent to the Town of Seaford. It encompasses an area approximately one mile in diameter from the Blades public wells, not extending beyond the Nanticoke River and Morgan Branch. The primary groundwater contaminants of concern are metals associated with electroplating compounds. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), namely perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), have also been found in groundwater and in eight residential wells and three public supply wells in the Nanticoke and Columbia Aquifers. PFOA and PFOS are contaminants which can cause adverse human health effects. There is ongoing, successful treatment of the Blades public water supply and residential wells to remove PFOA and PFOS from the water supply at the treatment plants. The City of Blades’ drinking water continues to meet Federal and State Safe Drinking Water Act standards, as shared annually in its water quality reports. Further investigations by EPA will work to identify the sources of the PFOA and PFOS contamination found in the groundwater.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The potentially responsible party (PRP) conducted a site investigation under Delaware's voluntary cleanup program from 2010 to 2017. EPA, in cooperation with Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC), performed a preliminary site assessment in 2017 and a site inspection for metals and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in areas adjacent to multiple facilities in 2017 and 2018.

In 2018, DNREC took action to ensure that the public drinking water in the area, which is provided by the Nanticoke and Columbia Aquifers, is treated to remove contaminants and meets state and federal drinking water standards. Subsequently, DNREC requested additional assistance from EPA in 2018 to help fully investigate the area. The addition to the National Priorities List will allow EPA to use Superfund authority and resources to work with DNREC to identify the sources of contamination and help resolve the groundwater concerns in the Blades area.

EPA completed a Time-Critical Removal Action at the Blades Groundwater Superfund site during the Summer of 2022. A Time-Critical Removal Action is a short-term response action that targets the current release of contamination into residential water sources. EPA installed Point of Entry and Point of Use water filtration systems in homes where the water sampling data showed levels of contaminants, like PFAS and metals, above EPA’s action level. This filtration installation effort was to ensure that community members who use private wells are not impacted by site-related contaminants in the groundwater. DNREC continues to supply water filtration systems for those who meet the State action level for PFAS but not the EPA action level.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

On September 3, 2020, EPA added the Blades Groundwater site to the National Priorities List, a list of the sites eligible for long-term cleanup financed under the federal Superfund Program. EPA is currently conducting a full investigation of the site to identify the nature and extent of the contamination. EPA will continue to keep the community and stakeholders informed and involved in the development of a cleanup plan that protects public health and the environment.
