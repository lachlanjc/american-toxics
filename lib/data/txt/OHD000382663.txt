### Background

The 70-acre Powell Road Landfill site is in Dayton, Ohio. The site is a former gravel pit which was converted into a landfill in 1959 and operated until 1984 under various owners. Commercial, industrial, and non-hazardous domestic wastes were disposed on site. The current owner is SCA Services of Ohio, a subsidiary of Waste Management of North America, Inc. The landfill closed in 1984 and was capped in 1999. The area of waste disposal covers about 36 of the site’s 70 acres and rises 30 to 40 feet above the surrounding terrain.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party actions.

U.S. EPA’s cleanup at the site consisted of improving the landfill cap, excavating contaminated soil and placing it under a cap, installing a landfill gas collection and destruction system, establishing a leachate (landfill liquid) collection system, placing flood protection and storm water controls, groundwater monitoring, and limiting the use of and access to the site.

Long-term protectiveness requires ongoing collection and treatment of landfill gas and leachate, and groundwater monitoring. Institutional controls restricting future site uses were put in place in 2010.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The cleanup construction at the site is complete. EPA is conducting the fifth five-year review of the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents.

The five-year review is an opportunity for the public to tell EPA about site conditions and any concerns they may have. If you would like to share comments, please contact the Remedial Project Manager listed on this website.

The previous review completed in 2018 found that the remedy is currently protective of human health and the environment by preventing direct contact with contaminated materials, venting and destroying landfill gases, and reducing water flow through the waste. However, for the remedy to be protective in the long term, either a Long-Term Stewardship Plan needed to be developed, or the Operations & Maintenance Plan needed to be modified, to include procedures to monitor and track Institutional Controls (ICs). In addition, Potentially Responsible Parties needed to establish procedures to communicate with U.S. EPA and Ohio EPA, and provide an annual certification to U.S. EPA and Ohio EPA that the ICs remained in place and were effective.

### Enforcement Information

On November 12, 1987, an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) was entered between the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, and SCA Services of Ohio, Incorporated (SCA).
