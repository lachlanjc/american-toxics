### Background

The Peak Oil Co./Bay Drum Company [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site consists of the 4-acre Peak Oil Co. property and the 14.8-acre Bay Drum Company property. The site is located on Reeves Road in Tampa. The Reeves Southeastern Galvanizing Superfund site is located directly north of the site, across the street from the Bay Drum Co. property. A CSX rail line borders the site to the north and industrial land uses border the site to the south, east and west. Land uses in the surrounding area are primarily industrial. The site also includes a wetlands area.

The site includes the area where waste oil refining and drum reconditioning operations took place. From 1954 to 1980, Peak Oil Company operated a waste oil refinery at the site. From 1962 to 1984, Bay Drum Company operated a drum reconditioning and recycling facility at the site. Bay Drum Company operated as Resource Recovery Association, Inc. until 1987. The company’s operations included the disposal of roofing shingles on the site property. The refining process generated and stored waste in three on-site pond areas.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency combined both of these areas – the Peak Oil Co. and Bay Drum Co. sites – into one site and placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1986.

EPA, the [Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP),](https://floridadep.gov/) and Peak Oil Generators Group and the Bay Drum Group, the site’s [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p), have investigated site conditions. By treating and monitoring groundwater, placing institutional controls on the site property and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, FDEP and the site’s PRPs continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

Site contamination does not currently threaten people living and working near the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Peak Oil Generators Group and the Bay Drum Group, the site’s PRPs, lead site investigation and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and FDEP.

Site investigations and cleanup activities have focused on four areas, which EPA refers to as [operable units, or OUs](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#o). These areas include

- OU-1: soil contamination on the Peak Oil Co. property
- OU-2: site groundwater
- OU-3: soil contamination on the Bay Drum Co. property
- OU-4: contamination of the nearby wetlands.

**1986**  
EPA conducted short-term cleanup activities at the Peak Oil Co. property, including treatment of about 4,000 cubic yards of sludge and soil.

**1989**  
EPA removed about 70,000 cubic yards of shingles from the Bay Drum Co. property. EPA conducted a second removal action in 1990 to remove contaminated soils and other materials from the property.

**2000 – 2001**  
The site’s PRPs conducted cleanup activities for OU-1 and OU-3.

**2004**  
EPA and the PRPs placed institutional controls on the site property in the form of restrictive covenants to restrict construction of wells and activities on the caps and to prevent people from coming in contact with contamination in the wetland sediments.

**2005**  
The PRPs began the amended cleanup activities for OU-3.

**2015**

**The PRPs implemented an Explanation of Significant Difference to conduct soil and sediment removal in OU4: Wetlands. This action achieved cleanup goals for the Wetlands.**

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [forth Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11155289.pdf) was published by EPA HQs in 2020. The remedy at the Site cuirently protects human health and the environment because no exposure pathways are completed.

Ground water treatment and monitoring are ongoing.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

In 2004, EPA and the PRPs placed institutional controls on the site property in the form of restrictive covenants to restrict construction of wells and activities on the caps and to prevent people from coming in contact with contamination in the wetland sediments.

The Southwest Florida Water Management District has listed the site and nearby surrounding area as a groundwater delineation area, which means all wells placed in the area require the District’s approval.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

EPA negotiated legal agreements with the site’s PRPs to investigate and clean up the site. The PRPs continue to fund site cleanup, monitoring and oversight activities.
