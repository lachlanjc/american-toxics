### Background

The 3-acre Franklin Slag Pile Site is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The site consists of a covered slag pile containing about 68,000 cubic yards of slag material – a byproduct from the copper smelter at the neighboring Franklin Smelting and Refining Corp. MDC, the operator of the site from the 1950s to 1999, sold the slag as sand-blasting grit. While MDC operated at the site, slag material migrated off the site in all directions. The slag previously covered the nearby rail line and area sidewalks, caked the inside of storm drains, and was observed blowing away from the site. EPA sampling determined that the slag contains leachable concentrations of lead. Additional sampling in 2000 revealed high concentrations of beryllium, copper and lead in the air near the pile. Investigations are under way to determine the nature and extent of contamination, and to identify appropriate cleanup actions. The site was proposed to the National Priorities List in 2001 and formally added to the list in 2002.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions.

EPA completed a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for the site in June 2007 and proposed installing a permanent cap over the site. The public comment period was extended twice by request so the community and other stakeholders could comment on the proposed cleanup plan. EPA drafted a Record of Decision, however, the state requested EPA postpone finalizing the document until additional alternatives were investigated.

In 2010, EPA initiated a RI/FS to investigate the groundwater below the site property. EPA also continued evaluating alternatives for addressing the slag pile and soil.

The Site’s groundwater remedial investigation was completed in 2018. A [feasbility study](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2290750) for both the slag pile and groundwater was completed in 2019. EPA issued its [Proposed Plan](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2262685) for cleaning up the site on January 8, 2020.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Residents are connected to public water source and are not using the groundwater for drinking water purposes.

The covered slag pile and grounds are periodically inspected, and maintenance is provided when necessary.

EPA issued its [Record of Decision](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/03/2303895) for the cleanup on August 1, 2020. The next step in the Superfund Process will be the [Remedial Design](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-remedial-design-remedial-action), where the technical specifications for cleanup remedies and technologies are designed. Additional outreach will be conducted by EPA before any cleanup work takes place at the site.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

EPA has not placed Institutional Controls (ICs) on the property, but the city has zoned it “heavy industrial,” placing a restriction on the property. ICs will be placed on the site after it is cleaned up.

### Emergency Response and Removal

EPA has conducted removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Emergency response actions in 2000 capped the slag pile, decontaminated and removed equipment stored in the slag pile, removed slag that had spilled off site, removed visible slag from the wetland next to the northeastern side of the site, excavated slag and contaminated soil from the active and inactive railroads southeast and northwest of the site, and cleaned slag from adjacent storm drains. Not all of the slag was removed from the surrounding properties.
