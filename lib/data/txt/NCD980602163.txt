### Background

The Roadside PCB Spill site includes an area where parties disposed of waste transformer oil along highways in North Carolina from June to August 1978. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983 because of contaminated soil resulting from waste handling practices. EPA and the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (NCDENR) have investigated site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site in order to protect people and the environment from contamination. EPA took the site off the NPL in 1986. EPA does not anticipate additional work at the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site includes 243 noncontiguous miles of highway shoulders in 14 counties in North Carolina. From June to August 1978, parties illegally dumped over 30,000 gallons of waste transformer oil along highway shoulders in North Carolina. In 1983, the EPA listed the site on the NPL and has led site investigation and cleanup activities in cooperation with North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (NCDENR).

- From 1979 to 1981, NCDENR conducted several site investigations and feasibility studies. NCDENR determined that contamination had not affected surface water, living organisms or groundwater.
- In 1982, EPA and NCDENR began cleanup activities and started construction of a landfill to receive wastes from the site. EPA and NCDENR removed and disposed of 40,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil at the landfill.
- In 1983, landfill construction finished. Construction included capping, grading and revegetation of the area.
- In 1986, EPA took the site off the NPL.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA’s cleanup approach for the site included constructing a landfill for disposal of contaminated waste; removing, transporting and disposing of contaminated waste at the landfill; and rebuilding the highway shoulders where contaminated waste was removed.

In 1986, EPA took the site off the NPL. The site's deletion notice states that, "EPA, with the concurrence of the State of North Carolina, has determined that all appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA at the PCB Spills site has been completed and has determined that no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate."

***EPA does not require Five-Year Reviews for this site. EPA does not anticipate additional work at the site.***

### Enforcement Information

EPA and NCDENR used federal and state funds for site cleanup activities.
