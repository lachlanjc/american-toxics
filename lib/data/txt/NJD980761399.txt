### Background

The Upper Deerfield Township Sanitary Landfill site is located in Upper Deerfield Township, New Jersey. The site is an inactive landfill covering 14 acres on a 23-acre tract of land. The site originally was used as a gravel pit from 1938 to 1960, when Upper Deerfield Township purchased 12 acres. The Township purchased the remaining acreage in 1977. A municipal landfill licensed to accept household waste operated at the site property until its closure in 1983. Landfill operations contaminated groundwater with mercury and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs are potentially harmful contaminants that can easily evaporate into the air. In 1986, the township installed a public water supply well and distribution system to provide drinking water to residents in the area. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in June 2000.

Seabrook Farms, Inc., a vegetable growing and processing company, operated a gravel pit and a waste disposal facility for its vegetative wastes at the site from about 1938 until 1960. Beginning in the late 1930s, pesticide residues and containers were allegedly disposed of at the site. Upper Deerfield Township acquired the site property in 1960 and operated the facility as a municipal sanitary landfill until December 1983. During its operation, the landfill was registered to accept household, commercial, municipal and vegetative waste.

In January 1980, in response to complaints about water quality from residents using private groundwater wells, the Township installed three monitoring wells at the landfill. In February 1980, the Cumberland County Health Department (CCHD) sampled the monitoring wells and 26 residential wells. The results of the sampling indicated the presence of VOCs and mercury in area wells.

After immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, and site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1984.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

After detection of residential well contamination in 1983 and before the completion of the public water supply and distribution system in 1986, the township supplied affected residents with bottled water and installed permanent water lines. All hookups to the new water system were completed in 1986 and the bottled water was discontinued.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The reviews concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site has been addressed in two stages: immediate actions and a single, long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.

In 1987, EPA began a study to determine the type and extent of the contamination by sampling the groundwater, soil, sediments and air. The results of the investigation showed that the groundwater and soil contamination no longer pose a health threat under current or likely future land use conditions. Therefore, EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in September 1991 that called for no further remedial action and ongoing air and groundwater monitoring.  

EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in June 2000.
