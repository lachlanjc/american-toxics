Background
The Action Anodizing, Plating, and Polishing Corp. (AAPP) site is located in Copiague, New York. Since 1968, AAPP has been the sole operator at the 1-acre site. AAPP’s operations primarily involved sulfuric acid anodizing of aluminum parts for the electronics industry, cadmium plating, chromate conversion coatings, metal dyeing and vapor degreasing. During a site inspection in January 1980 by the Suffolk County Department of Health Services (SCDHS), it was discovered that rinse water from AAPP’s operations was discharging directly into underground leaching pits. Under the direction and approval of the SCDHS in 1980, AAPP excavated the pits and backfilled them with clean sand and gravel. In 1985, AAPP expanded its building over the location of the former leaching pits. After cleanup, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1995.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
In 1980, SCDHS sampled the sediment of the on-site leaching pool system and found high levels of heavy metals, including chromium, cadmium, iron and zinc in the samples. Under the direction and approval of the SCDHS, AAPP dug up the pits and backfilled them with clean sand and gravel. EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s NPL in March 1989. After the cleanup, EPA completed a remedial investigation (RI) at AAPP in March 1992. The RI identified the nature and extent of contamination at the site and included sampling of groundwater, surface soils and subsurface soils for metals and organic compounds. The results of this RI indicated that the site does not pose any unacceptable risks to human health or the environment. A Record of Decision (ROD) was signed in June 1992, which selected “no further action” as the remedy for the site.
  A one-year groundwater monitoring program was performed to confirm the findings of the RI and ensure that the no further action remedy selected in the ROD was protective of human health and the environment. Groundwater samples were collected in May 1993 and March 1994. Results of the monitoring program showed no presence of site-related contaminants above acceptable standards. EPA removed the site from the Superfund program’s NPL in September 1995. The business ceased operations in June 2016, and left behind thousands of gallons of toxic, corrosive, acidic chemicals in containers and in open top plating tanks. Plating solutions, dry sludge wastes, cyanides, and other chemicals were scattered throughout the facility. The owner/operator stated that he did not have the funds or resources to clean up the waste on-site. The environmental effects posed by these materials include the potential contamination of soil, the potential for migration of contamination into groundwater and an airborne release. On December 7, 2016, EPA received a request from the NYSDEC requesting an emergency removal action under CERCLA.  A CERCLA removal action was initiated in January 2017 and completed in May 2017.  Approximately 335 containers and drums holding liquid and solid hazardous wastes were properly disposed of at approved disposal facilities.

Activity and Use Limitations
At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use.
They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
 For more background, see Institutional Controls.
EPA determined that institutional controls were not needed at the site. AAPP was delisted from the NPL in September 1995. Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
 Sampling and monitoring are not being conducted at the site. AAPP was delisted from the NPL in September 1995.
