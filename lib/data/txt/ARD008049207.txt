### Background

MacMillan Ring Free Oil is an abandoned refinery located in Norphlet, Union County, Arkansas. The 100-acre facility is bordered by a residential subdivision and the Norphlet Public School on the west, Hayes Creek on the north and east, and Massey Creek to the southwest. MacMillan Ring-Free Oil Refinery operated as a crude oil refinery and manufacturer of lubrication oil and asphalt products from 1929 to 1987. The property was sold in 1989 to Nor-Ark Industrial Corp. who used the on-site storage tanks for asphalt products until March of 1991 when the company filed for bankruptcy. The facility was refurbished by Norphlet Chemical as a chemical manufacturing plant in early 2004 to produce tetrafluoroethane (Freon 134A), an automotive refrigerant. In 2007, the facility was abandoned and has remained vacant. The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) placed the site on the State Priority List under the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission's Regulation No. 30 due to the potential for soil, surface water and/or ground water contamination and the need to remediate the site to protective levels. The ADEQ conducted a Comprehensive Site Assessment which developed remedial alternatives and, in November 2011, referred the site to the EPA for NPL consideration.

EPA conducted a remedial investigation (RI) from July through September 2015 to supplement the data collected from previous investigations. Soil, sediment, surface water, and groundwater samples were collected during the 2015 RI event. EPA conducted a targeted groundwater sampling in the week of January 27, 2020, to update the Site groundwater conditions

On September 29, 2020, after consultation with Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment and a 30 day public comment period, EPA issued a “No Further Action” Record of Decision for the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Extensive assessment and removal actions were completed at MacMillan in the early 1990s to clean up free liquids in the impoundments and prevent active releases to surface water. Wastes were treated on-site and treated materials were used to backfill the impoundments. In April 2009, a removal action by the EPA of tanks containing anhydrous hydrofluoric acid (AHF) and AHF mixtures was conducted.Extensive assessment and removal actions were completed at MacMillan in the early 1990s to clean up free liquids in the impoundments and prevent active releases to surface water.

During the 2021 removal operation for petroleum related compounds, four open asphaltic oil containing tanks located in the eastern portion of the Site were removed. Insulation bricks containing mastic with asbestos were discovered immediately south of the footprint of these former tanks. The area impacted by the asbestos was fenced off and set aside for a later CERCLA Removal Action. A CERCLA removal action for the asbestos-containing materials was initiated on November 6, 2022, on a two-acre area of the Site. Site activities were completed on December 9, 2022, and all personnel and equipment had left the site by December 13, 2022. Waste was transported to and disposed at Union County Landfill located in El Dorado, Arkansas.

During the 2022 CERCLA removal action, soil confirmation samples were below the asbestos action level. Perimeter air monitoring and sampling were conducted during removal operations, and air monitoring particulate averages were not detected above the action level.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

On September 29, 2020, after consultation with Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment and a 30 day public comment period, EPA issued a “No Further Action” Record of Decision for the site.

In July of 2021 petroleum related compounds remaining at the site that do not fall under the authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) were addressed through a separate Oil Pollution Act (OPA) action. Approximately 5,900 tons of asphaltic oil contaminated soil and 150 tons of asphaltic oil impacted steel were transported off-site for disposal. The excavated areas were backfilled with clean soil and seeded.

During the 2022 CERCLA removal action, soil confirmation samples were below the asbestos action level. Perimeter air monitoring and sampling were conducted during removal operations, and air monitoring particulate averages were not detected above the action level. The 2022 CERCLA removal activities are documented in Pollution Report #2 dated December 15, 2022. A final close out report for CERCLA activities was completed in June 2024.

Petroleum assessment and removal activities are ongoing at the Site in accordance with Oil Pollution Act (OPA) guidance to address the light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) and petroleum impacts. At this time EPA is postponing deletion of the Site from the NPL due to the continued presence of LNAPL and petroleum impacts. Once the petroleum cleanup is complete, EPA will consider deletion of the Site from the NPL.
