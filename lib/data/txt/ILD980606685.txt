### Background

The Pagel's Pit site is located in Winnebago County, Illinois. It consists of about 100 acres on the east bank of Killbuck Creek. It includes the north landfill, which covers about 47 acres. The new south landfill is not part of the site. The site also includes some of the land west of the creek where contaminated groundwater has migrated. The north landfill opened in 1972 and is now closed, having reached permitted capacity. Following cleanup, the site’s remedy is protective of human health and the environment in the short term. For the remedy to be protective in the long term, additional institutional controls are necessary.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Long-term protectiveness requires compliance with effective institutional controls. In order for the remedy to be protective in the long term, additional institutional controls are necessary.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The final remedy is in place. EPA selected the remedy for most of the site in 1991. It included landfill closure, including a cover and leachate and gas management systems, and a groundwater pump-and-treat system for downgradient groundwater. Final cover and final leachate and gas management systems for the western third of the landfill were put in place in 1997. The cover and management systems were installed for the rest of the landfill in 2000 and 2001.

EPA selected a “no action” remedy for contaminated groundwater in the southeastern part of the site in 1999, and updated the remedy for western groundwater to monitored natural attenuation (with a contingency for active remediation if source control and natural attenuation do not restore the aquifer, or if the contamination threatens downgradient wells). Natural attenuation describes a variety of in-place processes that, under favorable conditions, act without human intervention to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume or concentration of contaminants in groundwater.
