### Background

The 15-acre Woodbury Chemical Co. site is located in Commerce City, Colorado. Woodbury Chemical Company operated a pesticide production facility at the site from the late 1950s to 1971. Site activities and waste disposal practices contaminated soil with hazardous chemicals. Following construction of the site’s remedy, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1993. No additional cleanup actions are required.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1993.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The 15-acre Woodbury site is in Commerce City, Colorado, on the north Denver County line. A mobile home park is located one-third of a mile from the property, and about 3,000 people work or live within a one-mile radius. Woodbury operated a pesticide production facility at the site from the late 1950s until 1971. Five years after Woodbury closed its doors, the local health department was alerted to contaminated storm runoff from the vacant lot. Soil samples revealed mainly chlorinated pesticides and some heavy metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
