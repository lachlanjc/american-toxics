### Background

The 2.75-acre Airco [Superfund](http://www.epa.gov/superfund) site is a former industrial landfill northeast of downtown Calvert City in western Kentucky. The Site shares a border with the [B.F. Goodrich Superfund Site](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0401930) and sits between Kentucky Highway 1523 and the Tennessee River. The EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s [National Priorities List (NPL)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#n) in 1984 because landfill disposal activities contaminated ground water and soil. The EPA, the [Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection (KDEP)](http://dep.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx) and [potentially responsible parties (PRPs)](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-glossary#p) have investigated Site conditions and taken steps to clean up the site to protect people and the environment from contamination.

Because of their shared history and location, PRPs took Superfund-related cleanup actions at both sites under one approved cleanup plan (a Record of Decision, or ROD). The EPA approved the plan in 1988. PRPs implemented the cleanup plan in the 1990s.

By treating and monitoring ground water and undertaking Five-Year Reviews, EPA, KDEP and PRPs continue to protect people and the environment from site contamination.

Site contamination does not threaten people living and working near the site. The landfill area is fenced and secured. Waste in the landfill is capped. Local residents and businesses are not using contaminated groundwater for drinking water purposes.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The PRP for the Site (The Linde Group, formerly Airco) led site investigations and cleanup activities, with oversight provided by EPA and in cooperation with KDEP.

**1988**  
A Remedial Investigation (RI) was completed in 1988 that characterized contamination at the Airco landfill and the adjacent BFG landfill and burn pit. Data from the RI and conclusions from a human health risk assessment indicated unacceptable risks associated with potential exposure to contaminated soils, ditch sediment, and groundwater. The EPA selected the Site's long-term cleanup plan in the Site's 1988 Record of Decision (ROD), which included installing a system to remove contaminated groundwater migrating from the landfill. Additional cleanup activities included constructing a flood protection dike around the landfill, improving the landfill cap, monitoring groundwater, and placing deed restrictions on the Site property to prevent residential development and groundwater use.

**1992**  
PRPs started treating contaminated groundwater in 1992 by installing five groundwater extraction wells to pull contaminated ground water from beneath the landfill and stop it from spreading into the Tennessee River.

**1996**  
In 1996, PRPs started several cleanup activities required in the ROD, including constructing the flood protection dike, improving the existing landfill cap, installing the leachate and groundwater removal systems, combining surface soil and drainage ditch sediment, and installing site fencing.

**1998**  
Cleanup of the Airco Superfund Site is largely complete. The landfill has been capped along with the construction of a flood protection dike as required by the 1988 Record of Decision (ROD). An O&M Plan was issued for the Airco Landfill and addressed the the postclosure care requirements that are completed as needed by an on-site representative overseeing site maintenance. Post closure requirements for the Airco Landfill included an inspection of the site security fence and gates; inspection of drainage ditches for excessive sediment accumulation; verification that the stormwater pumping system is functioning effectively; inspection of the groundwater monitoring wells; and inspection of the landfill cover.

**2010s to Present**

Routine operations included landfill cap mowing, inspection, and minor repairs, and occasional clearing of vegetation from the flood protection dike.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The [most recent Five Year Review](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/04/11133696) was published by the EPA in 2024.

The Site is proctected by chain link fencing with barbed wire and locked gates. The road leading to the Site passes through other properties, which have full time staff watching over the property. Fencing and warning signs help keep people safe by making sure that only those with permission can enter.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

In June 2023, a legal agreement was recorded in the Marshall County Registry of Deeds to help protect the Site. The EPA confirmed that these rules help keep the cleanup efforts in place. The agreeement prevents homes from being built on the land and stops people from using private wells for drinking water. It also makes sure the landfill cover, treatment systems, and monitoring equipment are not disturbed.

Currently, the Site is safe and secure. People are not being exposed to harmful materials, and groundwater movement is under control. The landfill is fenced off and covered, and no one in the area is using contaminated groundwater for drinking.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The normal activities include routine monitoring and maintenance for the following:

- Keeping the area secure with fencing
- Inspecting and fixing and erosion or drainage issues
- Checking and repairing the landfill covers
- mowing the grass on top of the landfill
- Taking care of the stormwater system
- Groundwater monitoring
- Maintaining the wells and the Leachate Sump collection system

The Site's monitoring wells and leachate sumps do not currently require sampling or testing. However, the wells and leachate sumps at the Airco Landfill have not been closed off in case they are needed in the future. They may be used to check water levels or collect samples during cleanup work on nearby properties or as part of the barrier wall installation.

If these wells and leachate sumps need to be used later, they may need to be updated to ensure they still connect properly to the surrounding groundwater. As part of rountine checks, the wells and sumps are inspected twice a year for any signs of damage, such as cracks or broken locks. If damage is found underground, experts will decide whether the well should be repaired, replaced, or closed permanently.

### Enforcement Information

[Enforcing environmental laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement) is a central part of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. When warranted, EPA will take civil or criminal enforcement action against violators of environmental laws.

The EPA negotiated legal agreements with PRP to investigate and clean up the Site. The PRPs continue to operate and maintain the Airco Landfill remedy.
