### Background

The 485-acre Sacramento Army Depot site, established in 1945, was a supply depot primarily responsible for the receipt, storage, issuance, maintenance and disposal of electronics supplies. Improper waste disposal practices at the site contaminated soils and groundwater with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and heavy metals. Cleanup, operation and maintenance activities, and monitoring are ongoing.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal actions. The Sacramento Army Depot is participating in the Installation Restoration Program, a specially funded program established by the Department of Defense (DoD) in 1978 to identify, investigate and control the migration of hazardous contaminants at military and other DoD facilities.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the siteâ€™s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires enforcement of institutional controls and maintenance of the soil cover.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In May 2017, a Final Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) was issued with regulatory concurrence and signature for the South Post Plume and Parking Lot 3 Groundwater. The ESD discontinued active groundwater extraction to allow natural processes to occur while monitoring groundwater conditions. The modified remedy also includes contingency actions if groundwater conditions warrant their implementation.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Groundwater monitoring continues at the Site.
