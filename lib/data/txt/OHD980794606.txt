### Background

The 31-acre Van Dale Junkyard site is in Washington County, Ohio. Starting around the early 1960s, ten acres of the site were used for a licensed junkyard. The Van Dale facility received a variety of materials for disposal or salvage, including general wastes such as scrap metal, appliances, furniture, automobiles, tires and batteries. Several thousand drums of industrial waste were also disposed of at the site in the late 1970s. The site received wastes until 1980. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1986, EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. In 1992 a remedial investigation (RI) determined the extent and magnitude of the contamination at the site and found that the contaminants of concern included volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metals like arsenic, cadmium, and lead.

In March of 1994, the Record of Decision document detailing the cleanup for the site was signed, and in August of 1994, EPA approved a design modification to the cleanup to stabilize the area to be capped to minimize shifting.

U.S. EPA’s cleanup at the site consisted of installing a hazardous waste cover, or cap; excavating approximately 9,000 cubic yards of contaminated material from the site for either off-site disposal or for on-site containment under a hazardous waste cap, and monitored natural attenuation. It also included long-term groundwater, surface water and sediment monitoring; and limiting the use of and access to the site. Construction of the remedy finished in 2000.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions and is in the operation and maintenance phase. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents.

EPA is conducting the fifth five-year review of the site to verify the remedy continues to protect people and the environment. The review is scheduled to be completed in February of 2024. The five-year review is an opportunity for the public to tell EPA about site conditions and any concerns they may have. If you would like to share comments, please contact the Remedial Project Manager listed on this website.

The previous review completed in 2019 included an evaluation of background information, cleanup requirements, effectiveness of the cleanup, and maintenance and monitoring efforts. The review found that additional air and soil gas sampling was needed to determine if volatile organic compounds pose an unacceptable risk to current or future residents on the uncapped portion of the site. In addition, a supplemental risk assessment needed to be performed to determine if additional soil response actions and/or restrictions were necessary at the site.
