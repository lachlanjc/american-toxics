Background
The PCE Former Dry Cleaner Site is located in Atlantic, Cass County, Iowa. The site is a former dry cleaning facility located at 1205 E. 7th Street and operated during the 1960s. In 1974, the Iowa Department of Transportation leased the site as a materials testing laboratory. The former dry cleaning facility and IDOT laboratory facility no longer exist at this location. Municipal drinking water wells have been impacted due to groundwater contamination associated with the former dry cleaner. The groundwater contaminants of concern were identified to be the following volatile organic compounds: tetrachloroethene (PCE) and its degradation products including tricholoroethene (TCE) and 1,2-dichloroethene (DCE). The site was proposed for the National Priorities List (NPL) in September 2015 and was officially listed on the NPL in April 2016.  The EPA began the remedial investigation/feasibiltiy study in May 2016. The main objective of the RI/FS is to gather data to determine the nature and extent of the groundwater contaminant plume and evaluate remedial alternatives. In November 2017, the EPA completed in situ thermal remediation of the contaminated soils at the source area. The thermal remediation of source area soil resulted in the removal of approximately 1,007 pounds of PCE. In December 2018, the EPA completed the construction of the groundwater plume containment system. The containment system consists of two extraction wells that pump contaminated groundwater from the aquifer, which is then treated via air stripping technology. The containment system has been operational since early-December 2018. The EPA is collecting performance monitoring samples to measure the effectiveness of the groundwater containment system. In 2020, the EPA completed the RI/FS and issued the Proposed Plan the begin the 30-day public comment period on May 22, 2020. The EPA held a virtual public meeting via adobe connect on June 4, 2020, to present the Preferred Alternative within the Proposed Plan to address the groundwater contamination. The EPA issued the Record of Decision selecting Alternative 3 - Continued Operation of the Groundwater Extraction and Treatment System on September 28, 2020. The GETS is currently operating and treating approximately 290 gallons per minute, which is being routed into the Atlantic Municipal Utilities drinking water treatment plant for distribution. In 2023, semi-annual groundwater sampling will be conducted to measure the effectiveness of the GETS on reducing the contaminant concentrations within the groundwater plume. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal actions and was officially placed on the NPL in April 2016. Interim removal actions including the removal of 1,630 tons of contaminated soil beneath 7th Street in June 2015 has occurred. The EPA also conducted in situ thermal remediation of the source area soils in 2017. Confirmation soil sampling results collected in September and November 2017 indicated the cleanup goal had been achieved. The thermal remediation of source area soil resulted in the removal of approximately 1,007 pounds of PCE. In December 2018, the EPA completed the construction of the groundwater plume containment system. The containment system consists of two extraction wells that pump contaminated groundwater from the aquifer, which is then treated via air stripping technology. The system has been operational since early-December 2018. Groundwater results have not detected did not indicate PCE following treatment via air stripping. Since July 31, 2019, Atlantic Municipal Utilities has been accepting the treated water for drinking water distribution.  Top of Page
What Is the Current Site Status?
In October 2016, AMU-6 was taken out of service due to PCE contamination. The PCE concentration detected in AMU-6 was 30 µg/L, which exceeds the EPA drinking water maximum contaminant level of 5 µg/L.  In November 2017, the EPA completed in situ thermal remediation of the contaminated soils at the source area. The thermal remediation of source area soil resulted in the removal of approximately 1,007 pounds of PCE.﻿ In December 2018, the EPA completed the construction of the groundwater plume containment system, which became operational in early-December 2018.  In 2019, the EPA collected quarterly groundwater samples from the site monitoring wells. The groundwater model was updated to evaluate the effectiveness of the groundwater plume containment system.  The EPA issued the Record of Decision on September 28, 2020 selecting Alternative 3 - Continued Operation of the groundwater extraction and treatment system. The groundwater extraction and treatment system currently operating and treating approximately 290 gallons per minute, which is being routed into the Atlantic Municipal Utilities drinking water treatment plant for distribution. Since 2023, semi-annual groundwater sampling has been conducted to measure the effectiveness of the GETS on reducing the contaminant concentrations within the groundwater plume. Top of Page
Sampling and Monitoring
The EPA is collecting routine performance monitoring samples to measure the effectiveness of the groundwater containment system.
