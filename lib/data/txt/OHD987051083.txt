Background
Peters Cartridge Factory is located along the south bank of the Little Miami River in Kings Mills. The Peters Cartridge Factory produced ordnance and shot shell ammunition at the site from 1887 to 1934. The Remington Arms Co. purchased Peters Cartridge in 1934 and continued the production of shot shell and cartridge ammunition at the facility until 1944. The site was subsequently divided into multiple land parcels that have been owned and occupied by various non-ammunition entities. Top of Page
What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Ohio EPA conducted several screening investigations and evaluations at the Peters Cartridge site between 1994 and 1999 and concluded the site was affected by copper, lead and mercury. U.S. EPA proposed the Peters Cartridge site to the National Priorities List, also known as NPL in 2003 and selected a cleanup remedy in a document called a Record of Decision, or ROD in 2009. The site was placed on the NPL in 2012. After a subsequent site investigation, another document called Explanation of Significant Differences modified the ROD in 2015. The cleanup activities at the site started in March 2015 and were completed in June 2017. EPA’s cleanup consisted of removing contaminated soil; cleaning and removing debris and erosional material from the drainage culvert and outfall areas; removing and backfilling shoreline areas with clean fill; consolidating contaminated material in an onsite consolidation cell; cell capping; groundwater monitoring; and limiting the use of and access to the site. In September 2018 a portion of the site known as the Former Process Area was removed from the NPL after cleanup goals were met, reducing the approximate size of the site from 71 acres to 56 acres.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site is in the Operations & Maintenance phase of the Superfund process. As part of this phase, EPA conducts regular checkups known as five-year reviews to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. EPA is conducting the second five-year review of the site and should be completed in March 2025. The review is an opportunity for you to tell EPA about site conditions and any concerns you have. If you would like to share comments, please contact EPA’s Remedial Project Manager listed on this website. The prior five-year review (PDF) (50pp, 9.6MB, About PDF) completed in March 2020 concluded that the remedy at the site continued to be protective of human health and the environment the short-term. However, in order for the remedy to be protective in the long term, land use restrictions known as environmental covenants were needed in all the property parcels that need Institutional Controls. Since then, most of these Institutional Controls have been implemented. Institutional Controls are administrative and legal controls that help minimize the potential for human exposure to contamination and/or protect the integrity of the remedy.
