### Background

The Weldon Spring Former Army Ordnance Works site (WSOW) is in St. Charles County, Missouri, approximately 30 miles west of St. Louis. The site encompasses approximately 17,232 acres, including mixed areas of ownership (state and federally owned land parcels). The Army acquired the property in 1940 and began production of trinitrotoluene (TNT) and dinitrotoluene (DNT) in 1941 to support World War II efforts. The Army constructed 18 identical TNT and two DNT manufacturing plants beginning in May 1941 in the area now known as the Weldon Springs Training Area. Following deactivation of the production facility in 1945, the majority of the property was transferred to the state of Missouri and local entities.

Historical Army operations resulted in the release of hazardous substances to soil and groundwater at the site. The primary contaminants of concern (COC) are nitroaromatics. The site was listed on the National Priority List on February 21, 1990, and a Federal Facility Agreement (FFA) became effective on August 8, 1991. Remedial activities at the site have been divided into two Operable Units: OU1 for Soils and Pipelines and OU2 for Groundwater.

The WSOW site surrounds and is adjacent to the Weldon Spring Quarry/Plant/Pits site. The Weldon Spring Quarry/Plant/Pits site is a separate NPL site listed on March 13, 1989. The Department of Energy is the lead agency for the Weldon Spring Quarry/Plant/Pits site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Remedial activities at the WSOW site are being conducted under two OUs: OU1 for soils and pipelines and OU2 for groundwater.

**OU1 Soils and Pipelines** – This OU encompasses nitroaromatic-contaminated soils and pipelines resulting from Army production of TNT and DNT. Several areas at the site were used for disposal of wastes and debris. This includes three dumps, a landfill, eight burning grounds and seven wastewater lagoons. The Army constructed an underground wooden pipeline system between 1941 and 1942. The pipelines were used to transport wastewater generated from purification of TNT and DNT from settling tanks at the production lines to three treatment plants along the southern boundary of the WSTA. Another section of pipeline then transported wastewater to the southeast drainage where it was discharge to the Missouri River. Approximately 83,300 feet of buried pipeline were remaining at the site in 1996.

A ROD for OU1 was signed on September 26, 1996. The selected remedy included excavation and incineration of contaminated soils and pipelines; stabilization of lead-contaminated soils; on-site disposal of PAH and PCB-contaminated soils and construction debris. The remedial action started in 1998 with the excavation and incineration of DNT and TNT-contaminated pipelines, soils, and other wastes; treatment of lead-contaminated soil; and general property restoration. Treated soils and construction debris were placed in the Weldon Spring Quarry/Plant/Pits disposal cell at the Chemical Plant. A Remedial Action Completion Report was approved on September 30, 2004. Current activities for OU1 are to monitor and enfoce ICs for the T13 area.

**OU2 Groundwater** - This OU encompasses groundwater contamination resulting from historic Army operations at the site. A ROD for OU2 was signed on September 30, 2004. The selected remedy was monitored natural attenuation with institutional controls to restrict use. A Remedial Design/Remedial Action Work Plan (RD/RA WP) was finalized in January 2006. The RD/RA WP consists of two Phases—Phase I address monitoring required for the MNA remedy and Phase II describes the required ICs. Current activities for OU2 are to monitor and enforce ICs and conduct annual groundwater sampling to monitor the MNA remedy.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Current activities include continued groundwater monitoring and reporting. In addition, the Fourth Five-Year Review was completed on September 30, 2020. The purpose of a Five-Year Review is to evaluate the implementation and performance of a remedy in order to determine if the remedy is or will be protective of human health and the environment. The Fourth FYR identified multiple remedy issues for both OU1 and OU2. The Army completed the FYR Addendum and was submitted to the EPA on December 28, 2021. The Army ESD has been delayed due to defining the extent of contamination at the T-13 area.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Monitoring is conducted annually and includes a performance monitoring network of 7 springs and 17 groundwater monitoring wells.
