### Background

The Tomah Municipal Sanitary Landfill site is located in Monroe County, Wisconsin. The unlined landfill covers about 18 acres of the 40-acre site. The city of Tomah owned and operated it from 1959 to 1979. Operations contaminated groundwater with hazardous chemicals.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site’s long-term cleanup included a landfill cap and a gas extraction system. In 2000, EPA oversaw the construction of the cap, which is made of a thick synthetic membrane and several feet of clay. It was topped with a layer of soil and vegetation. The cap prevents water from mixing with the waste and slows contaminant movement into underlying soil and groundwater. In addition, the gas extraction system safely vents landfill gases into the air. Tests suggest these systems are working. The site’s groundwater cleanup relies on natural processes to clean groundwater, regular monitoring of groundwater and nearby Deer Creek, and restrictions to prevent use of groundwater in contaminated areas.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is conducting the fifth five-year review of the site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.
