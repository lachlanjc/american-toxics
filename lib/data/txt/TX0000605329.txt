### Background

**Site Description**

The Patrick Bayou Superfund Site, located in Deer Park, Texas, includes contaminated sediments throughout the bayou and part of the East Fork tributary to the bayou. Patrick Bayou is one of several small bayous of the Houston Ship Channel (HSC) in the lower portion of the San Jacinto River Basin as it enters Galveston Bay in southeast Texas. The Site is located in a mixed urban, highly industrialized petrochemical area in southeast Harris County, about one mile north of State Highway (SH) 225. Most of the upper portion of the Bayou consists of a series of open, concrete-lined stormwater channels and large metal/concrete culverts. These structures were installed to receive stormwater runoff and permitted wastewater discharges and for erosion control south of SH 225. Patrick Bayou drains 2.85 miles north to its confluence with the HSC. The bayou is typically 200 feet wide, expanding to 600 feet wide within the last quarter-mile before entering the HSC. During significant storm events, the bayou can overtop the bank and cause overland flooding.

Contaminated sediments and surface water have been documented within the bounds of Patrick Bayou starting below a series of culverts about one mile north of SH 225, extending through its convergence with the HSC and including a portion of the East Fork tributary. Contaminants of concern at the Site include poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mercury, total polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxin, lead, and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (BEHP).

The upper portion of the bayou contains extensive wetland vegetation affording a natural habitat for waterfowl and migratory birds. Significant populations of fish and marine mammals have been documented near the mouth of Patrick Bayou. Local fishermen fish for blue crab and catfish along the HSC even though the Texas Department of Health has issued a consumption advisory for children and women of childbearing age due to high levels of dioxin. A fish advisory is in place for the HSC and all contiguous waters for PCBs and dioxins.

**History of Contamination and NPL Listing**

Patrick Bayou receives stormwater runoff and wastewater discharges from adjacent industrial facilities and municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent. However, industrial wastewater discharged to the bayou is the primary source of contamination and has resulted in an accumulation of mercury, PCBs, dioxins, PAHs, lead, and bis phthalates in bayou sediment and exceedances of water quality standards.

In 1990, a fish advisory was placed on the HSC for dioxin which prompted investigations into sources of dioxin to the HSC. Under a Consent Decree with the EPA, the City of Houston completed a toxicity study of the HSC and published the findings in a 1995 report entitled " [Houston Ship Channel Toxicity Study Project](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/06/100031121.pdf) ". Patrick Bayou was found to have the highest concentrations of dioxin in sediment compared to other locations investigated along the HSC. The study also found ambient water and sediment toxicity and elevated levels of other priority pollutants in the bayou. These findings prompted the EPA and TCEQ (formerly the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) to conduct additional investigations of Patrick Bayou.

In 1996, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and TNRCC published a report entitled " [Contaminant Assessment of Patrick Bayou](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/06/100031123.pdf) " which identified significant accumulation of many priority pollutants in sediment, exceedances of water quality standards, and ambient toxicity of water and sediment in Patrick Bayou. Due to the distribution of contaminants in Patrick Bayou, EPA requested the industrial dischargers conduct an effluent study to pinpoint sources of pollutants. On September 5, 2002, the EPA placed the Site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL). The NPL listing found that the sediment contamination in the bayou posed a threat to downstream fisheries. Site investigations and cleanup planning are ongoing. 

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

**Non Time Critical Removal Action**

The EPA signed an Approval Memorandum on November 3, 2022, to conduct an Engineering Evaluation and Cost Analysis (EE/CA) for a Non-Time Critical Removal Action (NTCRA) at the Patrick Bayou Superfund Site. The purpose of the EE/CA will be to develop and evaluate removal action alternatives to address sediments contaminated with mercury and PCBs while long-term remedial alternatives continue to be evaluated. The EPA will provide the final EE/CA for public comment, after which the EPA will sign an Action Memorandum that selects a removal alternative after consideration of the EE/CA and the public comments received. Addressing areas with elevated concentrations of PCBs and mercury will help to significantly reduce the potential for direct contact and uptake of contaminants by ecological receptors, as well as reducing the transport of contaminated surface water and sediment into the Houston Ship Channel. While the NTCRA will accelerate the overall Site cleanup by containing and reducing site contamination, it does not constitute the final cleanup plan for the Site. A remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) is ongoing to complete the characterization of the nature and extent of contamination and to evaluate potential remedial actions for the Site to protect human health and the environment. EPA will document any future remedial action activities in a Record of Decision (ROD) after soliciting public comment.

**Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study Investigations**

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (AOC) on January 31, 2006, to conduct the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for the Site. Shell Oil Co., Lubrizol Corp., and Occidental Chemical Corp. are the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) which have agreed to perform the RI/FS under the AOC. The purpose of the RI/FS is to determine the nature and extent of contamination and to gather sufficient information about the Site to support an informed risk management decision regarding which remedy is the most appropriate for cleaning up the Site. The PRPs began sampling investigations in 2006, completed an RI Report in 2013, and submitted draft versions of the FS to the EPA in 2018. The EPA approved the RI Report in February 24, 2014. However, after review of the draft FS, the EPA determined that additional sampling, analysis and revisions must be performed to accomplish the objectives of the RI/FS and to support selection of a final Site remedy. In 2020-21, the EPA directed the PRPs in several letters to conduct additional sampling, submit a supplemental RI report, complete an EE/CA, and submit a revised FS report. The PRPs conducted additional sediment and surface water sampling in 2021, but have not yet addressed all of the issues identified by the EPA. The RI/FS process is ongoing.
