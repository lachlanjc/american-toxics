### Background

In 1981, Anoka County found volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, in on-site monitoring wells. Following investigations by EPA and MPCA, the site was placed on the Minnesota Permanent List of Priorities in 1984. In 1986, EPA added the site to the National Priorities List. MPCA entered into an agreement with a potentially responsible party to conduct the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Investigation to determine the nature and extent of contamination at the site.  
  
MPCA, with EPA concurrence, selected a cleanup remedy to address groundwater contamination at the site. The cleanup included a groundwater pump-out and treatment system, and installing another larger system to capture and treat contaminated groundwater. In 1995, the site entered MPCA’s Closed Landfill Program and a new cap was installed on the landfill. EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 1996.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 2006-2007, MPCA upgraded the groundwater pump-out and treatment system, and landfill cap, and installed an active gas control system. Under its Closed Landfill Program, MPCA continues to operate and maintain the landfill and groundwater systems.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy to review whether the site still protects human health and the environment. The most recent review, conducted in 2016, concluded that the site continues to be protective and groundwater quality is improving. Parts of the site were included in the nearby Sandhill Crane Natural Area, and native grasses have been planted on the landfill to help support the crane environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA is conducting the fifth five-year review of the site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

MPCA has developed a Landfill Management Plan for the site. In 2004, at MPCA's recommendation, the Hampton Township Board change the zoning of the site property to Closed Landfill Restricted and amended local ordinances to increased setback zones for additional protection.
