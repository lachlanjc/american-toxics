### Background

The 200-acre former Beloit Corp. facility is located in the village of Rockton, Ill. From 1957 until 1999, the company manufactured paper-making equipment on the site and operated a research center on the property. The manufacturing activities resulted in contaminating soil and area groundwater (underground water). U.S. EPA placed the site on the Superfund programâ€™s National Priorities List, or NPL, in 1990. The Beloit Corp. installed a groundwater pump-and-treat system in the manufacturing area of the site in 1996. Illinois EPA has been operating the treatment system since 2002. In 2008, EPA and IEPA expanded the groundwater pump-and treat-system. The federal and state environmental agencies also implemented land-use controls to prohibit residential use and the installation of new water wells on the research center portion of the site. That parcel has since been redeveloped and is now used by a paper equipment manufacturer. A lubricant manufacturer relocated some of its distribution and field support operations to the manufacturing area of the site in 2008 and has significantly upgraded that portion of the facility. EPA expects to remove the former research center portion of the site from the NPL in November 2018 because all cleanup actions at that location are complete other than maintenance, monitoring and five-year reviews.
