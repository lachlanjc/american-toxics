### Background

The 52-acre Williams Pipe Line Co. Disposal Pit site is located at the Pipeline 12th Street Terminal in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The terminal was constructed in the 1940s by the Great Lakes Pipeline Company. Williams Pipeline Company purchased the property in 1966. Historically, bulk quantities of liquid fertilizers as well as petroleum products were stored and conveyed at the terminal, including fuel oil, diesel fuel, unleaded gasoline, aviation gasoline and jet fuel. A burn pond was constructed in 1945 and used until 1987 to collect stormwater runoff, often contaminated with spilled materials, from various areas of the terminal. Petroleum products accumulated on the pond surface were periodically burned off.

These activities contaminated groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following construction of the site’s remedy, EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1999. No additional cleanup actions are required.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The long-term remedy included installation of recovery trenches along site boundaries to capture contamination and to prevent contaminated groundwater from moving off site at unacceptable levels. The site remedy also included groundwater monitoring. Remedy construction finished in 1994.

EPA and the State of South Dakota have determined that the site poses no significant threat to public health or the environment. No further cleanup actions or maintenance are required.  

After cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in 1999.
