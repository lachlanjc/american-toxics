### Background

The Port Washington Landfill site is located in North Hempstead, New York. The 54-acre area is part of a municipal landfill. The area was a disposal area for construction debris. In 1973, the Town of North Hempstead purchased it and operated a municipal landfill until closing the facility in 1983. Operation of the landfill resulted in an off-site soil gas plume composed of methane and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs are potentially harmful contaminants that can easily evaporate into the air. Following immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, the site’s remedy was put in place. The L-4 Landfill was properly capped, a landfill gas removal system to protect the adjacent neighborhood was installed, and a groundwater extraction and treatment system to contain the contaminated groundwater was built. These long-term landfill gas and groundwater treatment systems continue to be operated and the monitoring of these protective systems is ongoing.

The site was used from the 1880s as a sand and gravel mining operation. Subsequent to mining activities, the area became a disposal area for construction debris. The All-American Sand and Gravel Corporation operated the facility. Construction debris included concrete, wood and miscellaneous solid wastes. In 1973, the Town of North Hempstead purchased the property and operated a municipal landfill until closing it in 1983. Operation of the landfill during the 1970s resulted in the generation of an off-site soil gas plume composed of methane and VOCs. In 1981, Southport Water District Well No. 5, located about 1,500 feet west of the landfill, was closed due to evidence of organic chemical contamination.

After site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Immediate Actions: The Town of North Hempstead installed numerous gas vents on the western edge of the landfill, put in a manifold system to collect the vented gas, flared the collected gas, improved the existing leachate collection system, and improved the dispersion of flared gases through the addition of a stack. In 1987, the town removed and sampled about 60 drums that were discovered buried near the site. In 1990, the town installed a perimeter gas collection and venting system.  

Long-term Cleanup: EPA selected the remedy in the site’s September 1989 Record of Decision, or ROD. It included closure of the landfill; rehabilitation of the active gas collection system; additional perimeter gas venting; possible reactivation of the Southport well with air stripping treatment; and installation of additional groundwater extraction wells to restrict further migration of contaminants in the groundwater. The Town of North Hempstead completed the first phase of landfill gas migration mitigation in 1993 and the capping of the landfill in the spring of 1997. Construction and optimization of the extraction and treatment system finished in August 2000; it is anticipated that the system will operate for at least 30 years to achieve cleanup goals. To date, the system has treated about 95 million gallons of contaminated groundwater. The second phase of landfill gas migration mitigation, the extension of the active gas collection system to beyond the fill, finished in March 2000.  

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. Each of the reviews concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  
  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site is being addressed in two stages: immediate actions and a long-term remedial phase focused on cleanup of the entire site.

Capping of the 53-acre landfill has been completed, as have the two components of the landfill gas migration control system. The groundwater containment extraction and treatment system is completed and is operational.

EPA did a soil vapor intrusion investigation at a newly built residential development next to the site. Results indicated that vapor intrusion was not occurring.

EPA determined that all construction activities at the site were complete in July 2000.

Long-term groundwater treatment and monitoring are ongoing. The Town has continually operated and maintained the remedial systems at the site. The systems have underone a refurbishing and redesign in 2018 and 2019. Currently, the Town has optimized all the site's remedial systems and has finished the refurbished systems. The systems are fully protective and working well.  

### Sampling and Monitoring

The remedial systems at the site have recently been refurbished and the quarterly sampling continues.
