### Background

The NL Industries/Taracorp Lead Smelter site is located in Granite City, Illinois. NL operated a secondary lead smelter from around 1900 until 1983. Lead contamination from that operation has spread throughout 100 square blocks in three cities – Granite City, Madison and Venice – affecting about 1,600 homes, including areas where contaminated battery chips were used to fill in low-lying areas. There is a documented risk to public health from the exposure to lead at the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term.

Follow-up actions necessary to address long-term protectiveness of the remedy include minor cap repairs, access to the spread of battery chips from a capped area on Slough Road, putting effective institutional controls in place, and preparing a long-term stewardship plan. Cap repairs finished in 2009. The other actions are ongoing.

Long-term protectiveness also requires maintenance of site remedy components. Institutional controls must be implemented for areas where contamination remains in place. EPA will continue to work with the site’s PRP Group to approve the site’s Institutional Control Work Plan and oversee its implementation. Additionally, about 85 properties were never cleaned to the recommended action level for lead since access was not granted by residents. The responsible parties, under direction from EPA, have been contacting the residents to determine if they will grant access for the work. For those properties to which access was granted, the soil has been sampled to determine if it exceeds the cleanup levels. EPA will determine whether the soil in those yards is eligible for remediation to remove elevated lead levels.  

Other five-year review follow-ups may include monitoring of residential yards next to yards where the residents refused access for the cleanup. Follow-up actions are also necessary to fulfill the Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP) to address lead-based paint issues at the site. EPA will continue to monitor the progress of the SEP.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

**July 2018**  
EPA is conducting a status review of the site's cleanup. This type of review is required at least every five years where the cleanup is complete but hazardous waste remains managed on-site. These reviews are done to ensure that the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment. This is the fifth five-year review. The review will include:  
• An evaluation of background information  
• Cleanup requirements  
• Effectiveness of the cleanup and any anticipated future actions  
• An analysis of ways for EPA to operate more efficiently  
• Maintenance and monitoring efforts  
The review is scheduled to be completed by March 2019.
