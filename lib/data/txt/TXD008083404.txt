### Background

In 1926, Texas Electric Steel Casting Company (TESCO) began operating a metal casting foundry at the site. TESCO built a second foundry on the eastern portion of the site in 1970. TESCO primarily manufactured specialty molded parts such as large wheels, tracks and mining equipment. In 1926, Texas Electric Steel Casting Company (TESCO) began operating a metal casting foundry at the site. TESCO built a second foundry on the eastern portion of the site in 1970. TESCO primarily manufactured specialty molded parts such as large wheels, tracks and mining equipment.

The on-site facilities were demolished as a salvage operation under order of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court between March 1995 and January 1996. Structures currently on the Site include concrete foundations from several demolished foundry buildings, a laboratory and administration building, a railroad boxcar used as a former storage building, a large melt transformer in the northwest corner of the Site, and several concrete structures formerly used as vats. Remnants at the Site include numerous piles of demolition debris.

The EPA believes that the air emissions from the former foundry, which contained particles of lead, may have caused the on- and off-site soils to become contaminated through the air deposition of these particles. Foundry practices may have also contributed to the on-site lead contamination of the soils. Other probable sources of lead contamination that may have impacted the on- and off-site soils may include lead-based paint and historical deposition from vehicular lead-based fuel emissions, among other possible sources.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The MDI site is comprised of 3 OUs. OU1 onsite soils and groundwater. OU 2, off-site residential yards and high access areas, and OU 3, residential crawlspaces and those residences areas not addressed under OU 2.

OU 1 - In 1998 and 1999, the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) performed an extensive drum removal action with EPA’s oversight. The PRPs removed over 4,000 drums from the Can-Am operation. The drums contained spent refinery and petrochemical catalysts. Visibly contaminated soils were also removed from OU 1.

OU 2 and OU 3 - In 1998, prior to the OU1 and OU2 RI/FS, the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC, now TCEQ), removed lead-contaminated soil from 89 nearby residential properties. TNRCC removed surface soil (to a maximum depth of 1.5 feet below ground surface) with concentrations of lead that equaled or exceeded 500 mg/kg. About 12,025 tons of soil were characterized, excavated, and disposed of at permitted landfills. This removal action reduced the exposure of adults and children to lead. Following each removal, TNRCC conducted confirmation sampling to ensure that lead-contaminated soils did not extend below the 18-inch excavation depth.

In 2003, EPA completed removal actions to address lead soil contamination at 56 properties identified during the 2003 OU 1/OU 2 RI/FS. The properties included Blanche Kelso Bruce Elementary School, the Fifth Ward Multi- Service Community Center and residential properties. During May and June 2005, a second EPA removal action was performed to address lead contaminated soils exceeding 500 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) at five properties not addressed in 2003. At the conclusion of the 2003 and 2005 EPA actions, the EPA completed removals at a total of 59 residential and 2 high access properties, located to the east and north of the Site. The removal actions were conducted to remove surface soils with concentrations of lead that equaled or exceeded the 500 mg/kg action level to a maximum depth of 1.5 below ground surface for the purpose of reducing exposure of adults and children to lead.

In April 2006 and 2009, the EPA completed OU 3 removal actions at the northeastern portion of the Kelly Village Housing Complex and six additional residential yards of the Site. The removal action removed surface soils with concentrations of lead that equaled or exceeded the cleanup goal of 500 mg/kg to reduce the exposure of children and adults to lead in soils. The EPA believes that these removal actions addressed all of the Kelly Village areas and surrounding residential yards which could have been affected by site contamination from the former foundry for which EPA was granted access for sampling.

EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

OU 1 - The EPA and the OU 1 property owner are currently montioring groundwater at OU 1. Groundwater MNA monitoring events are completed every 30 months, with a schedule that alternates obligation for monitoring between the OU1 property owner and EPA. There have been two groundwater sampling events since 2018. EPA completed it's Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) field sampling event that was scheduled for September 2022. The Site Owner Lovett Homes had their contractor Ska Consulting perform the last groundwater MNA field sampling event in March of 2020 as part of an agreement with EPA. A copy of the MNA Sampling Report will be available at the local repository and on the Site webpage in April 2023.

OU 2 & OU 3 - The EPA is working on a site strategy, approaches to how to implement the new lead guidance, and evaluating the current data from previous investigations. This effort will assist in developing plans for a Remedial Investigation/Feasbility Study with tentative start date for the second quarter 2025.

  

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

For more background, see [Institutional Controls](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-institutional-controls).

The restrictive covenant, filed on May 19, 2010, prohibits exposure to contaminated groundwater under OU1 for any purpose until COCs no longer exceed their protective concentration levels (PCLs).

### Sampling and Monitoring

Ground water data is currently being collected under the “monitored natural attenuation” program according to the requirements of the “Record of Decision” and “Agreed Order on Consent.”

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. A removal action in 1998 removed contaminated soil from 89 residential yards. Another removal action in 2003 removed contaminated soils from 57 residential areas.
