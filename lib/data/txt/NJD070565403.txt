Background
The Scientific Chemical Processing (SCP) site is located in Carlstadt, New Jersey. The site includes a six-acre property where a waste processing facility that accepted various wastes for recovery and disposal was located. In the 1940s, the property was reportedly used for solvent refining and solvent recovery. The property owner sold the land to a predecessor of Inmar Associates, Inc. Aerial photographs from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s indicate that drummed materials were stored on site. In October 1970, SCP Company Inc. leased the property from Inmar Associates. SCP used the site for processing industrial wastes from 1971 until the company was shut down by court order in 1980. While in operation, SCP received liquid byproduct streams from chemical and industrial manufacturing firms, and then processed the materials to reclaim marketable products, which were sold to the originating companies. In addition, liquid hydrocarbons were processed to some extent, and then blended with fuel oil. The mixtures were typically sold back to the originating companies or to cement and aggregate kilns as fuel. SCP also received other wastes, including paint sludges, acids and other unknown chemical wastes. About 375,000 gallons of hazardous substances were stored on site in tanks, drums and tank trailers. After drummed materials were removed to address immediate threats to human health and the environment, and after site investigations, EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 1983.
The property currently hosts a solar panel field. A cleanup plan for on-property soil and shallow groundwater has been implemented. Contact with contaminated soil has been prevented and contaminated shallow groundwater has been contained. EPA issued a final cleanup plan to address contaminated deep and off-property groundwater in September 2012 and is overseeing its implementation.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
Immediate Actions: EPA removed four tanks containing numerous hazardous substances including polychlorinated byphenyls (PCBs) and fenced off the entire site, reducing public access, between 1985 and 1986. On-Property Soil and Shallow Groundwater: Following an investigation, EPA selected an interim remedy to address the contaminated soil and shallow groundwater on the property. EPA oversaw the placement of a cap over the property; the construction of slurry walls, which are underground walls that prevent the groundwater from migrating further from the contamination source; and the collection of groundwater within the slurry wall using pumps. The contaminated groundwater is then disposed of at an approved off-site facility. The interim remedy was completed in June 1992. After further investigation and monitoring the effectiveness of the interim remedy, EPA selected a final remedy for the on-property soil and shallow groundwater in August 2002. It upgraded the interim remedy and made it permanent. The permanent cleanup plan also included air stripping followed by solidification of a hot spot of soil contamination, with excavation of the hot spot if treatment was not successful, and institutional controls to prevent installation of new groundwater wells in the contaminated area. Field work for the remedial action started in April 2008 and finished in October 2011. Treatment of the hot spot did not prove successful, so 3,400 tons of materials were excavated from the area and disposed of at an approved off-site facility. Deep and Off-property Groundwater: Groundwater was monitored over several years. EPA selected a final remedy to address the deep and off-property groundwater contamination in September 2012. The major components of the selected remedy are: treating contaminated off-property and deep groundwater using in-situ treatment technologies, by injecting a substance or substances into the groundwater to cause or enhance the breakdown of the contaminants of concern to less toxic forms; monitored natural attenuation both during and after active treatment; and institutional controls to assure that the remedy remains protective until cleanup goals are achieved. EPA is overseeing the implementation of the remedy by the potentially responsible parties.

What Is the Current Site Status?
The site is being addressed in three stages: immediate actions and two long-term remedial phases. The first long-term phase focused on cleanup of on-property soil and shallow groundwater. The second is focused on cleanup of the deeper aquifer and off-property groundwater contamination. An interim remedy, which was intended to reduce migration of the contamination from on-property soil and shallow groundwater until a final remedy was selected and implemented, was put in place in 1992. In August 2002, a final remedy was selected for the on-property soil and shallow groundwater, and construction of the remedy was completed in October 2011. The on-property remedy is in the operation and maintenance phase. In September 2012, EPA selected a final remedy to address the deep and off-property groundwater contamination. EPA is overseeing the implementation of the remedy by the potentially responsible parties in two parts: the northern area where primary contaminants of concern include volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), and the southern area, where primary contaminants of concern include 1,4-dioxane. The VOCs in the northern are being addressed by a technology called Enhanced Anaerobic Biodegradation. Two rounds of injection and monitoring wells were installed in 2018-2021 in the area north of the SCP property. A substance is being injected in the wells to stimulate the growth of native bacteria underground that break down the contaminants of concern. The 1,4-dioxane in the southern area is being addressed by a technology called In-Situ Chemical Oxidation. Injection and monitoring wells will be installed in the summary of 2021 in the area just south of the SCP property. Another substance will be injected into the wells to break down the 1,4-dioxane into less toxic compounds. The installation of additional injection and monitoring wells are ﻿being considered each year based on the monitoring data collected in the previous years.
