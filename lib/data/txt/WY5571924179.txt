### Background

The 6,000-acre F.E. Warren Air Force Base site is located in Laramie County, immediately west of Cheyenne. Historically, the base has served as a cavalry outpost, quartermaster depot and intercontinental ballistic missile operations base. Past operations and disposal practices contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals on base and at some adjacent private residences. Cleanup is complete at many areas. Operation and maintenance activities and monitoring are ongoing at these areas. Investigation and cleanup activities continue at the remaining areas.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions. The Air Force performs all cleanup activities. EPA and the State of Wyoming provide regulatory oversight.  

The Air Force, with EPA oversight, has conducted five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site consists of 10 areas, referred to by EPA as operable units (OUs). These OUs include three landfills, two fire-protection training areas, six spill sites, base-wide groundwater, a firing range, a battery-acid disposal site and an open burning/open detonation area.

Long-term remedies at the site include monitored natural attenuation (MNA) and in-place chemical treatment of groundwater, landfill covers, landfill gas venting systems, removal of localized waste areas and institutional controls. The Air Force previously used a pump-and-treat system to clean up groundwater in some areas; the system was replaced with MNA. In 2013, the Air Force began cleanup of the firing range (OU7).

Site cleanup has also included removal actions or interim response measures, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Between 1984 and 1989, the Air Force removed contaminated soil areas, a grease tank and a leaking storage tank in OU1. In 1999, the Air Force installed a permeable reactive barrier (PRB) wall to treat contaminated groundwater at OU2. Cleanup of OU2 also included soil excavation and soil vapor extraction. In 1996, the Air Force extended a water line to residents of Nob Hill. In 1999, the Air Force removed waste from Landfill 3 and placed it in an approved waste co-location area (WCA).
