### Background

The United States Avenue Burn Superfund site is located in Gibbsboro, New Jersey and is comprised of undeveloped properties, woodlands, wetlands and two small creeks. From the mid-1800s until 1977, John Lucas & Company, and eventually the Sherwin-Williams Company, operated a paint manufacturing facility at a separate property located north east of the Burn Site. Paint wastes and solvents from the paint manufacturing facililty were dumped or poured onto the ground at the Burn Site and were often burned. These activities contaminated soils, sediments, groundwater and surface water with hazardous chemicals. The siteâ€™s long-term cleanup is underway.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Burn Site is comprised of a 12.7-acre area located east of United States Avenue and a 1.2-acre area immediately west of United States Avenue. Both areas were contaminated by Sherwin-Williams' past industrial waste disposal practices. Sherwin-Williams removed much of the principle waste from the site in two separate actions in 1979 and in 1997. In January 2023 Sherwin-Williams, with EPA oversight, started excavation of the remaining principle waste as well as residually contaminated soil and sediment (77,000 cubic yards) and completed removal of the material in January 2024. The excavated areas have been backfilled with clean soil and restorated with native vegetation. The restored site will be monitored to ensure survival of the native vegetation cover and limit invasive plant species.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Following the remediation of the soil and sediment at the Burn Site, Sherwin-Williams, under EPA oversight, will monitor the groundwater conditions to assess the effect soil and sediment cleanup has on groundwater quality. Multiple rounds of groundwater sampling in the coming years will provide information that will be used by EPA, with New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection input, to determine if remediaiton of groundwater at the Burn Site is warranted.
