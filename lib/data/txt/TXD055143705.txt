### Background

The Triangle Chemical Company site is located in Bridge City in Orange County, Texas. A chemical mixing and blending facility operated at the site from the early 1970s until 1981. Chemicals handled during operations included industrial cleaning compounds, automotive brake fluid, windshield washer solvent, hand cleaners and pesticides. Poor waste management practices resulted in soil and groundwater contamination and fishkills in Coon Bayou. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and groundwater monitoring are ongoing. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in April 1997.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal and state actions.

About 53,000 gallons of hazardous liquids and over 3,000 cubic yards of contaminated sludge waste have been remediated at the site. About 1,000 55-gallon drums, 21,000 gallons of tank liquids and 350 cubic yards of contaminated trash, debris and soil have been removed from the site. The State of Texas is currently monitoring the site for remedy effectiveness.

EPA has conducted five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Actions to ensure long-term protectiveness include groundwater sampling and maintenance in accordance with an approved operation and maintenance manual, continuing groundwater monitoring at well MW-7, repairing the fence and replacing damaged or missing well caps.

The Triangle Chemical Company operated a chemical mixing and blending facility on site from the early 1970s until 1981. Chemicals handled at the facility included industrial cleaning compounds, automotive brake fluid, windshield washer solvent, hand cleaners and pesticides.

Raw materials and finished products were stored at the site in surface storage tanks and 55-gallon drums. Waste management practices at the site were poor, and contamination at the site resulted from discharges from deteriorated drums and spills and leaks from drums and tanks. Local residents reported seven fish kills in Coon Bayou during a six-year period between March 1976 and October 1982. The fish kills were believed to have resulted from discharges of hazardous materials from the Site to the bayou.

The site owner/operator abandoned the site in 1981.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy, selected in 1985, included deep-well injection of liquids (53,000 gallons) and mechanical aeration of contaminated soils to release volatile organics to the atmosphere under controlled conditions. The remedial action finished in September 1990. Operation and maintenance activities and groundwater monitoring are ongoing.

Following cleanup, EPA took the site off the NPL in April 1997.

EPA has completed the FY 2021 Five Year Review for the Triangle Chemical Company Superfund Site. EPA finalized the report by June 29, 2021. The document was entered on the Site webpage on July 1, 2021 and a copy was made available at the local repository on July 8, 2021. The Triangle Chemical Company Superfund Site is currently protective of human health and the environment.

EPA is planning a ground water and indoor sampling event for sometime during late Spring 2023..- The sampling will include ground water and indoor air sampling for 1,4 Dioxane which was detected in site monitoring wells last year.

### Sampling and Monitoring

The TCEQ performs an annual groundwater monitoring at the Site. The FY 2021 Operations and Maintenance report will be added to the website by Fall 2020. The results of the FY 2021 groundwater sampling event will be in this report and Site maintenance activities.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1982, EPA installed a fence, removed drums, bulked and solidified contaminated soils, and sent soils and equipment to a permitted landfill. About 1,000 55-gallon drums, 21,000 gallons of tank liquids, and 350 cubic yards of contaminated trash and soil were removed. In 1985, EPA repaired the fence and dug a drainage canal at the site.
