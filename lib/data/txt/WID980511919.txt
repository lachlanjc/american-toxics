### Background

The Hunt’s Disposal Landfill site is a former landfill on County Line Road, east of Nicholson Road in the village of Caledonia and borders in the Root River. The HDL site was initially a gravel pit and began operation as an open disposal facility in 1959. During operation, the HDL site accepted municipal and industrial waste. In the early years of its operation, the HDL site burned much of its waste in an open pit. Facility operations contaminated soil, groundwater, and sediment Root River. Groundwater currently used as drinking water has not been affected by contamination from the site.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Based on extensive investigations, EPA placed the HDL site on the National Priorities List, or NPL, in 1987. The NPL is a list of the nation’s most contaminated waste sites eligible for cleanup under EPA’s Superfund program.

EPA completed a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study to determine the nature and extent of contamination as well as the best cleanup method. In 1990, EPA selected the final cleanup remedy and issued a Record of Decision. The HDL site achieved a Site-Wide Ready for Anticipated Use in 2009. This designation recognizes that all cleanup goals outlined in the ROD have been achieved and there are no unacceptable risks at the site, making the area ready for reuse.

In June 2007, a group of potential responsible parties submitted a Pilot Test Work Plan to temporarily shut down the groundwater extraction and treatment system and use monitored natural attenuation (MNA) to address groundwater contamination. In 2008, EPA granted approval to proceed with the pilot test. In October 2010, the PRPs submitted the results of the pilot study to EPA. The groundwater data collected at the site showed natural attenuation is occurring and reducing the concentration of contamination.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

In January 2020, EPA signed a [Record of Decision (ROD) Amendment (SIGNED) - Hunts Disposal Landfill (PDF)](https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/557462) (57 pp,7.85MB, [About PDF](https://www.epa.gov/home/pdf-files) ) to modify the groundwater remedy from a pump-and-treat system to the MNA program. MNA is used as a cleanup remedy when the source of contamination has been removed or contained, and only low concentrations of contaminants remain in the groundwater.

EPA is also conducting the third five-year review of the Hunt’s Disposal Landfill site. The Superfund law requires regular checkups of sites that have been cleaned up – with waste managed on-site – to make sure the cleanup continues to protect people and the environment.

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

Contaminants of concern included organic compounds such as vinyl chloride, benzene, trichloroethene, xylene, PCBs, and varous metals such as arsenic, chromium, and barium.
