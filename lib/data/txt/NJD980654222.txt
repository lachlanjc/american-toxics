### Background

The Evor Phillips Leasing (EPL) site covers six acres in Old Bridge Township. The surrounding area is largely industrial. In the early 1970s, the site was used for various waste treatment, hauling and disposal businesses. The site also contained nineteen horizontal furnaces which were used for the incineration of photographic film and printed circuit boards. Two former surface impoundments, used for the neutralization of caustic and acidic waste waters, were located in the northeast area of the site. The impoundments were unlined, enabling contaminants to migrate through the soil to groundwater, and surface water resulting in widespread soil, surface water and groundwater contamination. A State investigation conducted in 1982 estimated that approximately 150 drums containing chemicals were buried at the site. The Sayreville municipal wellfield is located approximately 1,000 feet southwest, and the City of Perth Amboy wellfield is located approximately 3,000 feet southwest of the site. All nearby residents have discontinued use of private wells and are now served by a municipal water supply.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

In 1983, the State excavated 30 to 40 drums and removed them from the site. This short-term cleanup, called a removal action, was also part of the site’s remedial investigation to determine the nature and extent of site contamination.

In 1992, EPA documented the selection of its first remedy for the site that included removal and disposal of buried drums, and an interim groundwater remedy using extraction, on-site organic and inorganic contaminant treatment, and on-site reinjection of groundwater underlying the site. Excavations from January 1996 through May 1997 unearthed over 1,000 buried waste containers in six areas of the site. EPA also conducted a removal action in early 1997 that required a temporary 10,000 square foot containmnent structure and resulted in the excavation of 34 drums and approximately 300 laboratory-sized containers. Construction of a groundwater treatment plant was completed in 1999. An interim groundwater remedy extracted and treated groundwater and injected the treated groundwater beneath the site. In 2002, treated groundwater discharge switched from onsite reinjection to the Middlesex County Utility Authority. The extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater with discharge to the Middlesex County Utility Authority ceased in March 2014. Contaminated groundwater is currently being treated by In Situ Chemical Oxidation.

In 2012, remaining soil “hot spots” were excavated and disposed off site and of low-level soil contaminats were capped.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

Two chemical oxidation injections to groundwater took place in March 2014 and June 2015. The injection events were both followed by four rounds of monitoring. While the monitoring indicated reductions in contaminant mass, some residual contamination remained. EPA required the responsible parties to undertake additional monitoring to insure that contaminated groundwater is not leaving the site and determine if onsite groundwater will achieve clean-up goals.
