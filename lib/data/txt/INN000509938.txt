### Background

The 18.5-acre Elm Street Ground Water Contamination site is located in Terre Haute in Vigo County, Ind. In the 1980s, sampling identified volatile organic compounds, or VOCS, contaminating several wells in Terre Haute's Elm Street municipal well field. “Groundwater” is an environmental term for underground supplies of fresh water. Potential source areas for the underground pollution include the Gurman Container and Supply property at 800 N. Third St., the Ashland (formerly known as BiState Products) property at 118 Elm St., and the Machine Tool Service (MTS) property at 701 N. First St. A step in the Superfund process called the Remedial Investigation was completed in 2016, and another action called the Feasibility Study was completed in 2017.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through a combination of federal and state actions.

### Sampling and Monitoring

EPA approved a Remedial Design for work at the site beginning in 2023.
