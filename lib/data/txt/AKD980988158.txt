### Background

The Arctic Surplus Salvage Yard (ASSY) Superfund site consists of 5 parcels totaling about 24.5 acres and is located 6 miles south of Fairbanks, Alaska. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) owned a portion of the site where it operated a landfill from 1944 to 1956. In 1959, DoD sold the site. It became a salvage yard for activities including battery cracking for lead recycling, transformer draining, ordnance and explosive scrap collection and more.

In 1988, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation detected high concentrations of metals in the soil and found large amounts of asbestos on site. Residents living around the site depend on an aquifer located just beneath the site for their water supplies. EPA added the site to the Superfund program's National Priorities List (NPL) in 1990, and immediately removed the asbestos, drums and contaminated soils. The DoD also began on-site soil treatment and isolated residual soil in a closed landfill covered with asphalt. DoD disposed of highly contaminated materials off site. Cleanup reached completion in 2005, and EPA deleted the site from the NPL in 2006.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The siteâ€™s long-term remedy included relocation and sorting of salvage material and debris; excavation and stockpiling of contaminated soil; soil treatment; off-site disposal of highly contaminated soil; consolidation of treated soil into a containment area over the closed military landfill; construction of a cap over the landfill; and groundwater and land use restrictions. Remedy construction took place between 2002 and 2006. Long-term monitoring is ongoing.

The site is being addressed through federal and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. Actions between 1989 and 1994 included removing 22,200 pounds of asbestos; fencing the site; stabilizing 75 gallons of the pesticide chlordane; disposing of the contents of 1,700 drums of liquid waste; and removing and containing highly contaminated soils. Removal actions also included cleaning up polychlorinated biphenyls ( [PCBs](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/search/index.cfm?keyword=PCB) ) and lead-contaminated soils from a ditch next to the site; removing PCB-contaminated transformers and incinerator ash containing dioxin; and removing and disposing of about 3,000 empty solvent drums.
