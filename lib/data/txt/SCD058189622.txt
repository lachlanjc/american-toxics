### Background

The Galey and Lord Plant is a former textile dyeing and finishing plant, located in northeastern South Carolina, at 670 North Main Street in Society Hill. The site occupies about 234 acres and was associated with multiple textile manufacturing facilities between 1966 and 2016.

Operations began in 1966 and included dyeing, finishing, and surface treatment of cotton and synthetic fabrics. The wastewater generated from textile manufacturing was treated in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which included several basins (0.2 to 9.65 acres) located adjacent to Cedar Creek and the Great Pee Dee River.

The plant was abandoned in 2016. The WWTP was shut down but was not remediated or cleaned and the basins are at capacity. As a result of textile operations, the wetlands and sediments of Cedar Creek and the Great Pee Dee River are contaminated with metals, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). PFOA and PFOS are fluorinated, organic, man-made compounds that are used to make fluoropolymer coatings and products that resist heat, oil, stains, grease, and water.

In 2018, Hurricane Florence made landfall and several WWTP basins flooded releasing wastewater to Cedar Creek and the Great Pee Dee River. This triggered an emergency response and a time-critical removal action. During the May 2019 time-critical removal action, the following items were removed from the property:

- Approximately 2,400 abandoned containers were bulked and transported off site for disposal;
- Approximatley 440,000 gallons of caustic solution were sent offsite to another EPA Superfund site, where the material was used to help neutralize the waste there;
- Approximately 100,000 gallons of liquid waste; 53,000 pounds of solid waste; and 17 roll-off containers of solid dyes were sent off site for disposal.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**2013**  
The potential responsible party entered into a Voluntary Cleanup Contract (VCC) with the state. The state VCC agreement resulted in the PRP installing a soil vapor extraction system to address TCE contamination in groundwater.

**2016 - 2017**  
The facility was abandoned in 2016 and the VCC was terminated in 2017 for failure to complete work.

**2019**  
EPA conducted a removal site evaluation (February 2019), emergency response (March 2019), and time critical removal action (May 2019). During the time-critical removal action a total of 2,400 abandoned containers were bulked and transported off property for disposal. About 100,000 gallons of liquid flammables, neutral, corrosive, and oxidizer waste; 53,000 pounds of solid flammable, neutral, corrosive, and oxidizer waste; and 17 separate hazardous materials cubic yard boxes of solid dyes were sent off property for disposal.

**2022**

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized the Galey and Lord Plant site to the National Priorities List (NPL) through a Federal Register Notice.

**2023**

The RI/FS Contract Award was awarded which serves as the mechanism for collecting data to characterize site conditions, determine the nature of the waste, assess risk to human health and the environment, and conduct treatability testing to evaluate the potential performance and cost of the treatment technologies that are being considered.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

On September 9, 2021, the Galey and Lord Plant site was proposed to the NPL through a Federal Register Notice. Proposing the site to the NPL allows EPA, the state, and the community to access significant technical and financial resources to address environmental and health risks. When EPA cleans up a site or a portion of a site, the site is available for beneficial uses. More than 850 Superfund sites nationwide have some type of actual or planned reuse underway. Community partnerships are critical to Superfund site cleanups. EPA's goal is to work with community partners to ensure a collaborative and transparent cleanup process.

### Sampling and Monitoring

Sampling has been conducted over the years to evaluate contamination on the property as well as surface water bodies and wetlands that received hazardous substances as a result of textile manufacturing activities and flooding. Now that it has been finalized on the NPL as of March 2022, additional sampling will occur in the form of a Remedial Investigation (RI). Sampling associated with the RI is anticipated to begin in early 2025.
