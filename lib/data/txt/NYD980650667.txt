### Background

The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield (KAW) is part of the EWB public-water supply system. It was constructed in 1962 and provided approximately 10 percent of the potable water produced by the Elmira water Board (EWB) until its closure in 1980 following the discovery of elevated levels of trichloroethylene (TCE). TCE contamination was first detected in the KAW in May 1980 during an inventory of local wells initiated by the New York Department of Health (NYSDOH). In July 1980, the Chemung County Health Department conducted further groundwater sampling in the area and similarly found elevated levels of TCE in the KAW and several private residences and commercial facilities. As a result of these findings, the EWB closed the KAW in September 1980 and removed it from its other sources of potable water for its users. In 1983, the Site was placed on the federal National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites. Additional sampling conducted by local, state, and federal agencies through 1985 identified TCE contamination throughout the Newtown Creek Aquifer. In March 1985, EPA initiated a removal action for the purpose of providing alternate water supplies to impacted residences not connected to the public water distribution system. Residences whose private wells were found to be contaminated with TCE in excess of the NYSDOH drinking water standards for public water supplies were supplied with bottled water and ultimately connected to the public water supply.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

**Immediate Actions**: Between 1985 and 1996, EPA provided alternate water supplies to residences affected by groundwater contamination. These actions involved temporarily supplying 25 residences with bottled water and connecting 95 residences to the public water system. Disconnected wells were closed to prevent further use.

**Groundwater Cleanup**: Based on the 1990 RI/FS results, EPA selected a remedy on September 28, 1990, selecting an interim groundwater remedy that called for the following: restoration of the KAW as a public drinking water supply; prevention of the further spread of contaminated groundwater within the Newtown Creek Aquifer by pumping of the KAW and the yet-to-be installed recovery wells between the KAW and the Facility; construction of two groundwater treatment plants, one located near the KAW and the other located between the Facility and the KAW to the above-mentioned recovered groundwater; and a long-term monitoring program to monitor contaminant migration and evaluate the effectiveness of the remedy. Following the restoration of the KAW, EWB elected not to use the KAW. At this time, the KAW remains out of service. The second treatment system, which is located at the Facility and treats groundwater extracted from two barrier wells was in operation until April 2014, when the pumping of the extraction wells were temporarily suspended to evaluate groundwater quality conditions. As part of that evaluation, groundwater monitoring is ongoing.

In October 2007, EPA conducted vapor intrusion sampling at six residences located near the Facility. Where permission was granted, EPA collected air samples from beneath, and in some cases within the buildings. The analytical results of the October 2007 vapor intrusion sampling showed TCE concentrations slightly above the standard concentrations in the air beneath two of the six homes. As a result, sub-slab depressurization systems were installed at these two residences to mitigate the impacts of soil vapor intrusion by reducing or eliminating vapor entry into the buildings. In addition to sampling residences for soil vapor intrusion, indoor areas in the occupied office spaces at the Facility were sampled in February 2015. VOCs were not detected above health-based levels in the four indoor air samples collected.

**Source Control:** Actions selected by EPA to address two areas of soil contamination at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation's manufacturing facility include: (1) excavation and off-site disposal; and (2) soil vapor extraction. The contaminated soils were source areas for the groundwater contamination at the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield. Construction activities for the soil remedies finished in 2000. EPA also selected excavation and off-site disposal to clean up PCB-contaminated sediments in the industrial drainageway. These construction activities started in September 2002 and finished in January 2003. In September 2006, EPA and six potentially responsible parties entered an administrative order on consent for the performance of the RI/FS for Koppers Pond, identified as OU4. OU4 is the final planned phase of the response activities at the Site. A Record of Decision was issued on September 30, 2016 to address the sediments/soils contamination of the pond surface.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA has designated four OUs for the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site. OU1 addressed residences and commercial properties that had relied upon private drinking water wells for potable water in the area affected by groundwater contamination in the vicinity of the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site. OU2 addressed contamination in the public supply well known as the Kentucky Avenue Well (KAW), a source of public drinking water. OU3 addressed soil contamination at the former Westinghouse Electric Corporation’s (Westinghouse’s) Industrial and Governmental Tube Division facility (Facility) and sediment contamination in the industrial drainageway that runs south from the Facility. OU4 is the final planned phase of the response activities at the Site, and addresses soil and sediment contamination in an area referred to as Koppers Pond. Koppers Pond historically received water from various sources via the above-referenced industrial drainageway. Koppers Pond is located in the Village of Horseheads, Chemung County, New York and is situated on property owned by the Village of Horseheads, Hardinge, Inc., and the Elmira Water Board (EWB). While the size of the water body referred to as the Pond has reduced in recent years because of changes in the nature of discharges from the Facility, to the industrial drainageway, among other things, the full 12-acre area of the former Pond area is to be addressed in OU4.

Operable Unit 4 is the last long-term remedial phase is to address the contaminated sediments/soils in Koppers Pond.
