Background
The 4-acre Bennett Stone Quarry site is located northwest of Bloomington in Monroe County, Indiana. Formerly a limestone quarry pit, the area was later filled in with various waste materials, including demolition debris, household wastes and electrical parts. Electrical capacitors containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were also dumped at the site during the 1960s and 1970s. These materials contaminated soils and groundwater. Following immediate actions to protect human health and the environment, the site’s long-term cleanup is ongoing.

What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?
The site is being addressed through federal, state, county, city and PRP actions. EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. All construction has been completed at the site and includes removal of contaminated soil, the installation of a passive quarry drain and spring treatment facility. All institutional controls are in place.
What Is the Current Site Status?
EPA selected the site’s long-term remedy in 1998. It included excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated wastes and PCB-containing capacitors, placement of a soil cover over the site, excavation of contaminated sediment in Stout’s Creek and its placement under the site’s soil cover, groundwater monitoring, and institutional controls. Most cleanup activities finished in 1999. A total of 36,172 tons of PCB-contaminated material was excavated and disposed of off site. In addition, 1,756 capacitors were removed and incinerated. The soil cover was placed over the site. Sediment removal from Stout’s Creek took place in 2000. Ten cubic yards of sediment were excavated and disposed of under the clean soil cover at the site. After cleanup finished, two springs on site showed low levels of PCB contamination. EPA updated the site’s remedy in 2006 to address the contamination. Activities included the installation of a passive quarry drain for the surrounding water-filled quarries to minimize groundwater flow from springs and groundwater, and construction of a groundwater interceptor trench to capture and treat PCB-contaminated water by carbon adsorption prior to discharge into Stout's Creek. The construction of the passive quarry drain and spring water treatment facility is complete. All institutional controls are in place and CBS is performing long-term monitoring activities.
Sampling and Monitoring
CBS is performing long-term monitoring and includes monthly sampling of treated water from the Bennett’s Dump spring water treatment plant, water level measurements and monitoring of springs.
Emergency Response and Removal
Cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 1983, EPA removed capacitors from the surface of the site and installed a clay cap, security fencing and warning signs. In 1987, Westinghouse, the site’s potentially responsible party (PRP), removed 252 PCB-contaminated capacitors, 14 cubic yards of contaminated soil and PCB-contaminated sediment in Stout's Creek.
