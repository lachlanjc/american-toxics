### Background

The Glen Ridge Radium site is located in the towns of Glen Ridge, Bloomfield and East Orange, New Jersey. The 130-acre area includes 430 residential properties and 14 municipal properties. Soil at the site was contaminated with radioactive waste materials suspected to have come from nearby radium-processing facilities that operated in the early 1900s. Later, houses were built on or near radium waste disposal areas. Some of the radium-contaminated soil was used as fill in low-lying areas. Some was mixed with cement for sidewalks and foundations. The site is similar to the Montclair/West Orange Radium site, which also had radium-contaminated soils from the same sources. Because of their proximity and the similarity of the contamination, EPA has jointly addressed the two sites. Following emergency actions to protect human health and the environment, long-term cleanup work began in 1990. All cleanup and restoration activities finished in December 2004. EPA took the site off the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in September 2009.

More than 220,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil were scattered on public and private properties in the communities of both sites. The projects were initiated in 1983, when the State of New Jersey identified a number of homes with high levels of radon gas and radon decay products, as well as excessive levels of indoor and outdoor gamma radiation. This site was addressed through Federal and State actions.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

Emergency Actions: In 1983, EPA installed temporary ventilation systems to reduce radon concentrations in 38 homes at the site and the nearby Montclair/West Orange Radium site. In addition, shielding from gamma radiation was installed in 12 homes. The radon systems were upgraded to higher efficiency units in 1990 and 1991. Two additional units were also installed at this time.  

Soil and Structures: In 1989, EPA selected a remedy to address the most severely contaminated properties, and deferred the selection of a remedy for the remaining, less-contaminated properties and contaminated public areas and streets until the site’s 1990 Record of Decision, or ROD. The selected remedy for all affected properties, regardless of the degree of contamination or property type, involved the excavation and off-site disposal of all radium-contaminated soil, followed by restoration of the properties. EPA categorized the contaminated properties into 15 construction phases, to address the most severe contamination first, and to avoid undue stress and community disruption from construction activities in any specific residential area.  

Remediation activities began with an investigation of the properties to determine the location, magnitude and extent of contamination. Where contamination was found, excavation areas and restoration plans were developed. Property cleanups ranged from the removal of a few cubic yards to excavation of contaminated fill material from the entire parcel – in some instances, this included removal of material from beneath the basement slab. At the most extensively contaminated properties, occupants were temporarily relocated while cleanup was in progress.  

Groundwater: After a groundwater investigation, EPA determined that no further action was necessary. EPA documented this finding in the site’s September 2005 ROD.  
Cleanup work began in 1990; all cleanup and restoration activities finished in December 2004.  
  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site has been addressed in several stages: emergency actions and long-term remedial phases focused on cleanup of soil, structures and groundwater.  

Cleanup work began in 1990; all cleanup and restoration activities were completed in December 2004. EPA sent final letters and data packages with final testing results to property owners and municipal officials within the cleanup area. The site was deleted from the National Priorities List in September 2009.
