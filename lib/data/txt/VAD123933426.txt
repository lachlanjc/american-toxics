### Background

The Former Nansemond Ordnance Depot (FNOD) 975-acre Site is in Suffolk, Virginia, near the northwestern end of State Route 135. The property was obtained by the United States Department of Army between 1917 and 1929 and was known as Pig Point Ordnance Depot. Between 1917 and 1960, the Army used the property for munitions storage, shipment, classification, reconditioning, loading and destruction. At the end of World War II, the Navy used the Depot for demobilization, including the destruction of explosives, ammunition, and chemicals. The site also includes an abandoned landfill and an offshore area, which extends from the low tide line to one mile offshore, to the James River and Nansemond River channels.

In June 1960, the facility was declared excess by the Federal government. Of the original 975.3 acres, 5.87 acres were being used at that time by the State for road right-of-way. The remaining government property was conveyed to the Beazley Foundation Boys Academy, which operated a private boys military academy there until 1968. The Beazley Foundation conveyed portions of the site to Virginia Electric Power Company in 1960, General Electric Company (GE) in 1965, and the former County of Nansemond for road right-of-way in 1966.

In 1968, Beazley Foundation ceased operations and donated the remaining property to the Virginia Department of Community Colleges (VDCC), which currently uses it for the Frederick Campus of Tidewater Community College (TCC). VDCC later conveyed one portion of the property to the Hampton Roads Sanitation District and allowed another portion to be used for the construction of Interstate 664. The property was acquired by GE in 1965 included an existing military building, which was modified by GE in 1966, doubling its size. This modified building was utilized by GE as a television assembly plant. GE also added a finished goods warehouse onto this building in the early 1970s. GE eventually acquired a total of about 134 acres of the FNOD. GE operated a television assembly plant at this location until approximately 1988.

A site inspection identified hazardous substances on Site. EPA added the Site to the Superfund program’s National Priorities List (NPL) in 1999. EPA identified extensive contamination in disposal pits, fill and demolition areas, holding tanks, trenches, and off-shore dumping areas. The Site’s cleanup includes the removal of munitions, explosives, contaminated debris, and various military items, as well as the removal of contaminated soil. Due to groundwater contamination, the City of Suffolk has extended municipal water lines to the TCC campus.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The Site is being addressed through federal actions. The US EPA, United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ) partner together to work through Site investigation and possible cleanup at the FNOD. Site activities include remediation of contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater. Investigations are ongoing.

During the initial National Priorities Listing (NPL) six source areas were identified, however after further investigation, there are 20 areas of concern (AOC) that have been identified at the Site. EPA has signed Records of Decision (RODs) selecting remedies for the following 7 Sites:

James River Beachfront (OU 1): ROD signed on September 05, 2019. No further action for cleanup.

Horseshoe Pond (OU 3): ROD signed December 28, 2016. No further action for cleanup.

Track K Dump (OU 4): ROD signed Record of Decision May 31, 2007. No further action for cleanup.

Offshore Marine Area (OU 6): ROD signed May 24, 2004. No further action for cleanup.

XXCC3 Landfill GW (OU 10): ROD signed October 06, 2014. No further action for cleanup.

Groundwater AOC 22 (OU 11): ROD signed October 06, 2014. No further action for cleanup.

Track H & I Magazine Line (OU 13): ROD signed August 28, 2020. No further action for cleanup.

To date, over 400 munitions have been excavated from the former Nansemond Ordnance Depot (FNOD) property which were considered "live" or to contain enough explosives to warrant disposal/deactivation by denotation. The remaining munitions response activities at the FNOD are being conducted as non-time critical removal activities, and currently include munitions investigations at the former burning grounds and steam-out pond areas of the FNOD. Interim land use controls for munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) at the FNOD NPL Site were jointly developed by the USACE and EPA to protect human health and the environment where the risk from MEC is known, suspected, or cannot be totally eliminated by the CERCLA process.

The interim Land Use Control Implementation Plan (LUCIP) was completed August 21, 2002, and called for the City of Suffolk and the Virginia Community College System/Tidewater Community College to impose land use controls for munitions at the FNOD. Virginia Community College System/Tidewater Community College signed a memorandum of Agreement with the Corps of Engineers on February 2, 2005, to implement land use controls for munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) at the FNOD. The City of Suffolk, Virginia agreed to the same in August 2005. Land Use Controls for MEC are expected to be made final in a future Record of Decision.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

There are currently 10 areas of concern under investigation at the Site. The US Army Corps of Engineers has the lead role for cleaning up the Former Nansemond Ordnance Depot

### Activity and Use Limitations

At this site, activity and use limitations that EPA calls institutional controls are in place. Institutional controls play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use. They also guide human behavior. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent land uses – such as residential uses – that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.

### Emergency Response and Removal

Cleanup to date has included several removal actions, or short-term cleanups, to address immediate threats to human health and the environment. These actions, which began in 1988, included removal of munitions, explosives, contaminated debris and miscellaneous ordnance items; excavation of contaminated soil; extension of municipal water lines to the Tidewater Community College Campus (TCC); land use restrictions; removal of landfill contents; and shoreline stabilization.

November 1988 to February 1991 - TCC Soccer Field Area Removal Action: the following materials were removed from the TCC Soccer Field area by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE): 4,400 pounds of munitions boosters, 260 pounds of bulk explosives, 1,360 pounds of munitions/miscellaneous ordnance (19 live 3" British shells), and 30,275 pounds of contaminated soil.

April to June 1992 - TCC Soccer Field Area Removal Action: USACE conducted additional removal action activities at the TCC Soccer Field area: 316 tons of contaminated soil and miscellaneous ordnance items, including 2 three-inch British shells, were removed from TCC property. Confirmatory soil samples indicated the presence of residual soil contamination, including lead and TNT.

From October 1996 to November 1996, a removal action was conducted by the USACE which involved the sifting of excavated soil that had been stockpiled during the construction of a storm water detention pond at the Tidewater Community College. The sifted soil contained munitions fuze adapters, munitions boosters, 20 mm projectiles, 37 mm projectiles, and 60 mm mortars. The USACE sifting operation resulted in the removal of 500 cubic yards of soil and 31,450 pounds of ordnance material.

From November 1998 to January 1999, a removal action was conducted by the USACE which involved the removal of 857 tons of XXCC3 material, also referred to as impregnite, and associated soils from disposal trenches located on property owned by Dominion Lands, Inc. XXCC3 is a granular powder used to neutralize chemical warfare agents. Based upon the success of the removal action, the soils at the impregnation kit disposal area were delisted from the NPL on March 20, 2003.

On December 30, 1999, EPA and USACE finalized an enforceable agreement for the performance of a time-critical removal action for ordnance and explosive hazards at specific areas identified at the FNOD. The time-critical removal action included: (1) access restrictions to the James River Beachfront disposal source area and the Nansemond River Beachfront disposal source area, which includes fencing and signage; (2) implementation of institutional controls for ordnance at the FNOD, specifically including the areas identified as Dominion Lands A, Dominion Lands B, General Electric A, and General Electric B; and (3) the location, identification, excavation, and removal of buried munitions at 5 discrete areas identified at the FNOD along with appropriate post-removal site control.

The initiation of the physical removal of identified munitions at the 5 discrete areas began in March 2000 and was competed in June 2004. The time-critical removal action for ordnance and explosive hazards at the FNOD also included post removal site control. Interim land use controls for munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) at the FNOD NPL Site were jointly developed by the USACE-Norfolk District and EPA to protect human health and the environment where the risk from MEC is known, suspected, or cannot be totally eliminated by the CERCLA process.
