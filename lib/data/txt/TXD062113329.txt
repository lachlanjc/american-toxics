### Background

**Current Status**

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 6 achieved Construction Completion for the Tex Tin Corporation Superfund Site with the signing of the Preliminary Closeout Report on September 20, 2004. Construction cleanup activities have been completed for all four operable units that comprise the Tex Tin Superfund Site. A development company plans to use the site as a container facility to support the new Texas City megaport facility that will cost more than $600 million and add nearly 2,000 direct and indirect jobs to the area has purchased the former smelter property

**Site Background**

The 170-acre Tex-Tin Corp. site is located in Texas City, Texas, about 10 miles north of Galveston. A tin and copper smelter operated at the site from 1941 to 1989. The site contained numerous waste piles, five wastewater treatment ponds, open and closed acid ponds, slag piles, a permitted low-level radioactive waste landfill, and an inactive hydrocarbon recovery facility. Historical operations and waste disposal practices contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, operation and maintenance activities and groundwater monitoring are ongoing.

**National Priorities Listing (NPL) History**

Proposal Date: June 17, 1996  
Final Listing Date: September 18, 1998  
Population: An estimated 25,000 people live within a three-mile radius of the site.  
Setting: The 170-acre Tex Tin site is a former tin and copper smelter. The site contained numerous waste piles, five waste water treatment ponds, open and closed acid ponds, slag piles, a permitted low level radioactive waste landfill, and an inactive hydrocarbon recovery facility. Industrial facilities are located north and west from the Site and marsh areas are located to the south.

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions. EPA has conducted five-year reviews at the site. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. To ensure long-term protectiveness of the remedy, the following recommendations and follow-up actions should be addressed: revegetation of caps, potential blockage of a letdown channel, increase of radionuclide concentrations, and updates to project action limits and turbidity measurements.

Cleanup of residential properties allows the properties to continue to be used for residential purposes.

Cleanup of the former smelter facility and related properties addressed the source of contamination associated with the site and prevented the threat of potential site and off-site contamination to public health and the environment.

The remedial action for the Swan Lake Salt Marsh Area will provide protection to ecological receptors in the marsh area and Swan Lake. The remedial action will prevent potential releases of contaminated sediments to the environment.

The United States government constructed the tin smelter as a World War II emergency tin supply plant. It operated under a government contract from 1941 to 1956 as the Tin Processing Corporation. From 1941 through 1989, the facility primarily produced tin.The United States government constructed the tin smelter as a World War II emergency tin supply plant.

### What Is the Current Site Status?

EPA divided the site into four operable units (OUs) to prioritize and manage cleanup.

*OU-1:* OU-1 includes about 140 acres and is the former tin and copper smelting facility. OU-1 also includes off-site Ponds 22, 24, 25 and 26. The primary components of the long-term remedy, selected in 1999 and updated in 2000, included treatment, off-site disposal, on-site stabilization and containment, and institutional controls. The groundwater remedy included installation of a slurry wall, enhanced evapotranspiration and groundwater monitoring. Remedy construction finished in September 2004.

*OU-2:* OU-2 includes about 29 acres of the former facility currently owned by BP Amoco Corporation. EPA selected “no further action” as the final remedy in a 2000 Record of Decision (ROD) because Amoco implemented response actions in 1998 under the Texas Voluntary Cleanup Program.

*OU-3:* OU-3 consists of the La Marque residential areas located about 2,000 feet northwest of the smelter facility. EPA completed the cleanup of the residential yards in June 1999 through a time-critical removal action. Following cleanup, EPA selected “no further action” as the final remedy in a September 2000 ROD.

*OU-4:* OU-4 addresses the Swan Lake ecosystem, consisting of the area between the hurricane levee and the shell barrier islands separating Swan Lake from Galveston Bay, and includes Swan Lake, its associated salt marsh habitats and the Wah Chang ditch east of Loop 197. The long-term remedy, selected in 2001, included installation of segmented wave barriers. The remedial action finished in 2004.
