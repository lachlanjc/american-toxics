### Background

The 110-acre Sheridan Disposal Services site is located in Waller County, Texas. Sheridan Disposal Services operated a commercial waste disposal facility on site from about 1958 to 1984. The company disposed of a variety of organic and inorganic chemicals and solid wastes at the site. The site included a 12-acre lagoon surrounded by a dike (about 17 acres) and a 42-acre evaporation system. The lagoon served as a holding pond for the disposal of overflow wastes and waste treatment residues. The company deposited ashes, combustion residuals and liquid wastes in the lagoon. The facility treated waste by steam distillation, open burning and incineration. Waste disposal operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. Following cleanup, groundwater monitoring is ongoing.  

### What Has Been Done to Clean Up the Site?

The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party (PRP) actions.  
  
EPA has conducted several five-year reviews of the site’s remedy. These reviews ensure that the remedies put in place protect public health and the environment, and function as intended by site decision documents. The most recent review concluded that response actions at the site are in accordance with the remedy selected by EPA and that the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment in the short term. Continued protectiveness of the remedy requires repair of the perimeter fence, repair of eroded areas on the outer slopes of the cap and review of the designated alternate concentration limits.  

### What Is the Current Site Status?

The site’s long-term remedy included in-place stabilization of waste ponds, treatment of wastes, erosion control, installation of a cap over the lagoon and dike area, natural attenuation and groundwater monitoring. EPA later updated the remedy to remove biotreatment of wastes before stabilization and capping. Remedial activities for lagoon wastes finished in 2006. Annual groundwater sampling is ongoing.  

### Sampling and Monitoring

EPA completed the first Five Year Review for the Site in July 2010. The purpose of the Five Year Review is to determine if the remedial action is still protective of human health and the environment and functioning as built. The Five Year Review determined that the remedy remains protective. In order for the remedy to remain protective in the long term, the report identified three recommendations that need to be implemented. The recommendations include making repairs to damaged areas of the perimeter fence, repairing eroded area on the outer slope of the cap, and updating the alternate concentration levels. All of the recommendations have been addressed.
